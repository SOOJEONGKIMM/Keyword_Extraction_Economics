"Contrast effects in consumers' judgments of products can stem from changes in how consumers mentally represent the stimuli or in how they anchor rating scales when mapping context-invariant mental representations onto those scales. We present a framework for distinguishing between these types of contrast effects on the basis of whether changes in mean ratings of multiattribute stimuli are accompanied by evidence of changes in their rank order. We also report two empirical studies. In study 1, mean overall ratings of a core set of car profiles showed contrast effects due to manipulations of the ranges of gas mileage and price in several sets of context profiles.  Diagnostic tests implied that these effects reflected changes in response-scale anchoring rather than in mental representations. In study 2, consumers high and low in knowledge of automobile prices showed equally large contrast effects on ratings of the expensiveness of a core set of real cars. Diagnostic tests showed that these reflected true changes in mental representation for low-knowledge consumers but only changes in scale anchoring for more knowledgeable ones. Thus, ostensibly similar context effects on simple ratings have different underlying causes and implications for behavior. The findings suggest alternative interpretations of contrast effects in past research on price perception, consumer satisfaction, and service quality.","['nan', 'SERVICE QUALITY', 'BRAND CHOICE', 'REFERENCE PRICES', 'MODEL', 'BEHAVIOR', 'CONTEXT', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'SATISFACTION', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['service quality', 'behavior', 'context', 'satisfaction', 'knowledge']","['rating scales', 'contrast', 'knowledge', 'quality']",0.25,0.2
"We draw on an in-depth longitudinal analysis of conflict over harvesting practices and decision authority in the British Columbia coastal forest industry to understand the role of institutional work in the transformation of organizational fields. We examine the work of actors to create, maintain, and disrupt the practices that are considered legitimate within a field (practice work) and the boundaries between sets of individuals and groups (boundary work), and the interplay of these two forms of institutional work in effecting change. We find that actors' boundary work and practice work operate in recursive configurations that underpin cycles of institutional innovation, conflict, stability, and restabilization. We also find that transitions between these cycles are triggered by combinations of three conditions: (1) the state of the boundaries, (2) the state of practices, and (3) the existence of actors with the capacity to undertake the boundary and practice work of a different institutional process. These findings contribute to untangling the paradox of embedded agency-how those subject to the institutions in a field can effect changes in them. We also contribute to an understanding of the processes and mechanisms that drive changes in the institutional lifecycle.(circle)","['nan', 'SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'MOVEMENT', 'DYNAMICS', 'IDENTITY', 'AGENCY', 'POLICY', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'GOVERNANCE']",['agency'],"['institutional work', 'fields', 'innovation', 'paradox']",0.0,0.0
"In food packaging, light and pale colors are often used to highlight product healthiness. What has been largely overlooked is that this seemingly positive health cue may also convey another crucial piece of information. It is this paper's premise that light-colored packages evoke two opposing effects: They stimulate favorable health impressions (health effect) and they activate detrimental taste inferences (taste effect) which jointly guide the purchase decision. To contribute to a better understanding of when this package cue is an asset or a liability, this research elucidates the boundary conditions under which the opposing effects operate. The unfavorable color-induced taste effect should be particularly dominant when (i) consumers have a strong need to make heuristic taste inferences (i.e., when tasting is not possible) and (ii) when health is not the overarching goal (e.g., for less health-conscious consumers). A series of experiments manipulating actual food packages confirms that the package health cue can indeed trigger negative taste associations in the consumer's mind that backfire. Marketers therefore are advised to consider the identified contingencies carefully. (C) 2016 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Despite substantial scholarly interest in the role of contracts in alliances, few studies have analyzed the mechanisms and conditions relevant to their influence on alliance performance. In this paper, we build on the information-processing view of the firm to study contracts as framing devices. We suggest that the effects of contracts depend on the types of provisions included and differentiate between the consequences of control and coordination provisions. Specifically, control provisions will increase the level of conflict between alliance partners, whereas coordination provisions will decrease such conflict. Conflict, in turn, reduces alliance performance, suggesting a mediated relationship between alliance contracts and performance. We also contribute to a better understanding of contextual influences on the consequences of contracts and investigate the interactions of each contractual function with both internal and external uncertainties. Key informant survey data on 171 alliances largely support our conceptual model.","['alliances', 'contracts', 'control and coordination', 'conflict', 'performance', 'framing', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS', 'ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMISM', 'RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE', 'CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK', 'FORMAL CONTRACTS', 'TRUST', 'COORDINATION', 'COOPERATION', 'MANAGEMENT']","['alliances', 'contracts', 'control and coordination', 'conflict', 'performance', 'framing', 'coordination']",[],0,0.0
"Research Summary: Research exploring investor reactions to sustainability has substantial empirical limitations, which we address with a large-scale longitudinal financial event study of the first global sustainability index, DJSI World. We examine investor reactions to firms from 27 countries over 17years that are added, deleted, or continue on the index. We find that once relevant controls and comparisons to observationally equivalent firms beyond the index are included, DJSI events have only limited significance and/or materiality. Nonetheless, investors' valuation of sustainability around the world has evolved over time, involving diminishing reactions to U.S. firms and increasing benefits, particularly of continuation on the index, over time. The study highlights the importance of careful analysis and longitudinal global samples in making inferences about the financial effects of social performance.Managerial Summary: The debate about how investors perceive corporate social responsibility (CSR) predates Milton Friedman's famous statement that the only social responsibility of business is to increase profits. Although extensive research has studied whether sustainability contributes to financial performance, we have yet to understand whether investors believe it pays off. This financial event study of reactions to the addition, continuation, and deletion from DJSI World, the first global sustainability index, shows that investors care little about DJSI announcements. Nonetheless, there is some evidence that global assessments of sustainability are converging and that investors may increasingly be valuing continuation on the DJSI, suggesting that firms may gain at least limited benefits from reliable sustainability activities.","['CSR', 'financial event study', 'firm value', 'investors', 'space', 'sustainability', 'time', 'CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'RETURNS', 'IMPACT', 'PRICE', 'RISK', 'INSTITUTIONS', 'STOCKS', 'EVENT', 'SPACE']","['csr', 'financial event study', 'investors', 'sustainability', 'time', 'corporate social responsibility', 'financial performance', 'event']","['sustainability', 'financial event study', 'social performance', 'corporate social responsibility csr', 'financial performance']",0.6,0.375
"A longitudinal study of family business leaders nearing retirement age examined the effects of goal adjustment capacities (disengagement and reengagement) on retirement planning. Goal disengagement predicted taking concrete steps to prepare retirement, whereas goal reengagement was related to having positive retirement expectations. Family business leaders with high goal reengagement capacities who trusted their successor's abilities set an earlier retirement date than others. Leaders with poor goal disengagement capacities who did not trust their successor were unable to improve their retirement expectations over time. This study shows the importance of psychological variables in the retirement planning process of family business leaders.","['family business succession', 'retirement', 'goal disengagement', 'goal reengagement', 'trust', 'UNATTAINABLE GOALS', 'SUCCESSION PROCESS', 'FIRMS', 'DISENGAGEMENT', 'EXPLORATION', 'AGE']","['retirement', 'goal disengagement', 'goal reengagement', 'trust', 'disengagement', 'age']",['expectations'],0.0,0.0
"Mobile channel additions have been shown to increase consumer-brand relationships, brand satisfaction towards and overall purchasing from a retailer, but what is less apparent is whether shareholders are fully rewarded for retailers' mobile channel additions. Results from an event study on 115 announcements relating to mobile app additions of publicly traded U.S. retail firms between 2009 and 2016 indicate that the stock market responds generally positively to mobile app additions, but specifically to the two mobile app addition types. Stock market responses to search-related and purchase-related app additions are moderated by firm size, product category, and target customer age. For announcements of search-related apps, the market responds more positively to product retailers than to service retailers, and to small firms than large ones. For announcements of purchase-related apps, the market responds less positively to firms that target younger customers than firms who do not especially target them. (C) 2018 New York University.

"The authors develop an econometric model of the relationship between a household's private-label (PL) share and its behavioral store loyalty. The model includes major drivers of these two behaviors and controls for simultaneity and nonlinearity in the relationship between them. The model is estimated with a unique data set that combines complete purchase records of a panel of Dutch households with demographic and psychographic data. The authors estimate the model for two retail chains in the Netherlands-the leading service chain with a well-differentiated high-share PL and the leading value chain with a lower-share PL. They find that PL share significantly affects all three measures of behavioral loyalty in the study: share of wallet, share of items purchased, and share of shopping trips. In addition, behavioral loyalty has a significant effect on PL share. For the service chain, the authors find that both effects are in the form of an inverted U. For the value chain, the effects are positive and nonlinear, but they do not exhibit nonmonotonicity, because PL share has not yet reached high enough levels. The managerial implications of this research are important. Retailers can reap the benefits of a virtuous cycle; greater PL share increases share of wallet, and greater share of wallet increases PL share. However, this virtuous cycle operates only to a point because heavy PL buyers tend to be loyal to price savings and PLs in general, not to the PL of any particular chain.","['private labels', 'store brands', 'store loyalty', 'share of wallet', 'simultaneity', 'nonlinear effects', 'BRANDS', 'CONSUMER', 'SYSTEMS', 'ENTRY', 'SHARE']","['store loyalty', 'share of wallet', 'simultaneity', 'share']",['behavioral store loyalty'],0.0,0.0
"Technology development in firms is frequently based on a combination of internal and external technological learning. Consequently, firms need to develop both technological capital (a patent portfolio) and alliance capital (a portfolio of technology alliances). This paper examines the relationship between technological capital, alliance capital, and their joint impact on the technological performance of firms, with an application to the application-specific integrated circuit industry. We find that positive marginal returns to alliance capital are decreasing at higher levels of alliance capital. Technological capital and alliance capital can either augment or reduce each others' influence on innovation performance depending on the stage of the technology life cycle in the industry. A reinforcing relationship related to absorptive capacity requirements and technological uncertainty is present in early stages, while technology leakage and market competition effects render the combination of high levels of technological and alliance capital counterproductive in later stages of the technology life cycle.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'PORTFOLIO DIVERSITY', 'SOCIAL-STRUCTURE', 'MARKET-STRUCTURE', 'JOINT VENTURES']",['absorptive capacity'],"['innovation', 'absorptive capacity']",0.5,1.0
"Recent criticisms of the concept of opportunities either ignore the natural evolution of conceptual definitions in all the social sciences (Davidsson, 2015; Davidsson, Recker, & von Briel, 2020) or substitute different words for this concept (Foss & Klein, 2020). Neither tack provides a strong justification for abandoning the concept of opportunity in the field of entrepreneurship. Indeed, the concept of opportunities has forced entrepreneurship scholars to be clearer about their assumptions, has focused attention on Knightian uncertainty and the process of forming and exploiting opportunities, and links entrepreneurship research with some theories in the field of strategic management. It seems likely that opportunities will continue as an important concept in the field of entrepreneurship for some time.","['nan', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'APPROPRIATION', 'EPISTEMOLOGY', 'PROBABILITY', 'DISCOVERY', 'PROMISE', 'FIRMS']","['strategic management', 'uncertainty']","['entrepreneurship', 'uncertainty']",0.5,0.5

"Recent studies suggest the relationship between dynamic capabilities and competitive advantage may be jointly affected by organizational and environmental factors. We enrich this nascent perspective by developing a configurational theoretical framework - underpinned by the mechanism of strategic fit - wherein dynamic capabilities lead to a competitive advantage when they support a strategic orientation appropriate for the levels of dynamism and munificence in the environment. Results of a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis using primary data show that dynamic capabilities lead to a competitive advantage in dynamic, munificent environments by enabling the combination of differentiation and low-cost orientations. In stable, non-munificent environments, dynamic capabilities are effective in support of a low-cost orientation. The central insight of this study is that the relationship between dynamic capabilities and competitive advantage is contingent upon the strategic fit between organizational and environmental factors, contributing to a more rigorous and configurational dynamic capabilities view.","['configurational theory', 'dynamic capabilities', 'environmental dynamism', 'environmental munificence', 'fuzzy-set analysis', 'strategic fit', 'strategic orientation', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'MARKETING CAPABILITIES', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'BUSINESS STRATEGIES', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'RECONFIGURATION', 'ORIENTATION', 'RESOURCES', 'POSITION']","['dynamic capabilities', 'strategic fit', 'strategic orientation', 'environment', 'orientation']","['capabilities', 'competitive advantage', 'fit', 'orientation']",0.25,0.2
"Building on a sociolinguistic framework, our research explores the impact of code-switching on the persuasiveness of marketing messages. Code-switching refers to mixing languages within a sentence, a common practice among bilingual consumers. We investigate how responses to different types of code-switched messages can provide insight into bilingual consumers' persuasion processes. A pilot study reveals a code-switching direction effect such that minority-language slogans switching to the majority language result in greater persuasion than majority-language slogans switching to the minority language. The effect is attributed to the salience of the code-switched word in the slogan. Study 1 explores this code-switching direction effect in more detail and shows that when associations toward the minority language are positive, the code-switching direction effect is reversed.","['nan', 'LANGUAGE', 'STUDENTS', 'ENGLISH']",['language'],['persuasion'],0.0,0.0

"There has been growing interest in both management and marketing regarding how individuals become identified with organizations and how organizations attempt to manage these identifications. The authors present a framework built on explicit and implicit points of convergence in research conducted in both these disciplines. In their review of the management and marketing literatures, the authors suggest three fundamental mechanisms, or bases, for managing organizational identification: relational, behavioral, and symbolic. Furthermore, the authors argue that how an individual is affiliated with an organization will impact the relative influence of these identification management bases. The authors conclude by suggesting how management and marketing scholars can create a theoretical space for future interdisciplinary work. Such a change would involve moving away from employees versus customers as a prime division between the fields and moving toward a more fine-grained approach that emphasizes the unique characteristics of individual-organizational relationships.","['organizational identification', 'affiliation', 'managing identification', 'social identity theory', 'role theory', 'externalization', 'extended self', 'symbols', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTIFICATION', 'COMPANY IDENTIFICATION', 'SELF', 'COMMITMENT', 'FRAMEWORK', 'WORKERS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DETERMINANTS', 'MECHANISMS']","['organizational identification', 'organizational identification', 'framework', 'mechanisms']",[],0,0.0

"This paper seeks to identify the sources of wide and persistent variations in learning performance in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. In the resource-based view of the firm, human capital is frequently assumed to contribute to competitive advantage due to its inimitability based on its intangible, firm-specific, and socially complex nature. Consistent with this view, we find that investments in firm-specific human capital have a significant impact on learning and firm performance. More specifically, human capital selection (education requirements and screening), development through training, and deployment significantly improve learning by doing, which in turn improves performance. However, we find that acquiring human capital with prior industry experience from external sources significantly reduces learning performance. We also find that firms with high turnover significantly underperform their rivals, revealing the time-compression diseconomies that protect firm-specific human capital from imitation. These results provide new empirical evidence of the inimitability of human capital.

"This article investigates the effect of time pressure on choice deferral. Recent research suggests that the likelihood of deferral is contingent on the ease of making the selection decision (which option to choose) as well as the overall attractiveness of the selected alternative. We focus on how time pressure systematically impacts choice deferral by increasing the use of noncompensatory decision rules in the selection decision and by increasing the relative emphasis placed on the unique features in the deferral decision (whether to choose). Consistent with the hypotheses, we find over a series of five studies that time pressure (1) decreases choice deferral when choice involves high conflict but not when conflict is low:, (2) reduces the impact of shared features on choice deferral, and (3) decreases choice deferral for sets with common bad and unique good features (approach-approach conflict) but not for sets with common good and unique bad features (avoidance-avoidance conflict). We further show that greater attention to the unique features is not a general property of decision making under time pressure but rather a consequence of the primacy of the selection decision over the deferral decision. Consistent with this premise, time pressure did not decrease the relative attention paid to common features when the task was described as purely a deferral decision. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.","['nan', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'INFORMATION SEARCH', 'UNIQUE FEATURES', 'RISKY CHOICE', 'CONFLICT', 'ALTERNATIVES', 'ATTRIBUTES', 'JUDGMENTS', 'STRATEGY', 'BRANDS']","['decision making', 'unique features', 'conflict']","['choice deferral', 'conflict']",0.5,0.3333333333333333
"In today's volatile economy, innovation in providing interactive services to consumers through a variety of channels is critical in retailing. Interactive service innovations offer opportunities for retailers by creating new markets or offering new benefits in existing markets. They also pose threats as existing customers encounter new alternatives offered by competitors. This article explores some of the most promising opportunities in interactive retail services; namely, the increasing power of consumers, channel synergies, pre- and post-transaction service, optimal use of resources, and consumer heterogeneity. In discussing these areas of opportunity we identify knowledge gaps and suggest research questions relevant to these gaps that warrant attention.

"Because of increasing levels of competition and decreasing product life cycles, a firm's ability to generate a continuous stream of innovations may be more important than ever in allowing a firm to improve profitability and maintain competitive advantage This paper investigates several issues that are central to an examination of the innovation productivity in a firm. First, the relationship between a firm's commitment to research and development and its innovative outcomes is examined. Two innovative outcomes are analyzed: (1) invention, which focuses on the development of new ideas; and (2) innovation, the development of commercially viable products or services from creative ideas. Invention is measured by the number of patents granted, and innovation is assessed by the number of new product announcements. Second, because many inventions ultimately result in marketable innovations and because patents may provide protection for new products, the relationship between patents and product announcements is also investigated. Finally, the ability of a firm to benefit from its inventions and innovations is studied by examining their separate effects on firm performance, measured as return on assets (ROA) and sales growth. Drawing from a sample of 272 firms in 35 industries over 19 years, the results from a model of simultaneous equations provided support for some of the hypotheses, but several other surprising findings were found. As expected, R&D spending was positively related to patents. This finding is consistent with others who argue that internal research capabilities, particularly those with a strong basic research component, is key to enabling a firm to generate creative outputs. More surprising was the finding of increasing returns to scale to R&D spending. While this contradicts much of the existing research, it is consistent with economic arguments for the advantages of scale in innovation. Also interesting is the finding that, while a significant curvilinear relationship exists between R&D spending and product announcements, it is not the predicted inverse-U but instead a U-shaped relationship. Consistent with previous work, product announcements were found to be positively related to both performance measures. A negative relationship was found between patents and both ROA and sales growth. While these findings were unexpected, they are intriguing and call into question the value of patents as protection mechanisms. In addition, these results may be resulting from the rise of strategic patenting, where an increasing number of firms are using patents as strategic weapons. As expected, a positive relationship was found between patents and new product announcements.","['nan', 'BASIC RESEARCH', 'BUSINESS PERFORMANCE', 'MARKET', 'STRATEGY', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'PROFITABILITY', 'ADVANTAGE', 'SIZE', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP']","['basic research', 'market', 'profitability', 'advantage']",[],0,0.0

Discussion elaborates the ways informants normalize credit/debt in transposing their categories, in improvising meaning combinations, and in suturing the meaning patterns to particular subject positions in constituting themselves as consumers. Theoretical contributions (1) distinguish consumers' collaborative production of cultural meanings with friends, family, and others in the social domain and with financial agents and institutions in the market domain and (2) document the productive capacities of these meanings in patterns and trajectories in configuring people as consuming subjects. Implications situate such cultural reproduction processes in the United States in discussing how the national legacy of abundance informs the normalization of credit/debt.","['nan', 'CONSUMERS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'MONEY']",['consumers'],[],0,0.0
"This multiple case study of eight entrepreneurial narratives of failed businesses examines how narratives that express different emotional states (folks) reflect different efforts to make sense of failure experiences (strokes). Our comparisons of the narratives' emotional content (describing emotional states at the time of business failure and presently) revealed some new insights. First, high negative emotions motivate making sense of a loss, while high positive emotions provide cognitive resources to facilitate and motivate making sense of the failure event. Second, emotion-focused coping helped deal with negative emotions. Finally, sensemaking was also facilitated by cognitive strategies that focused attention on the failure event and promoted self-reflection.","['nan', 'POSITIVE EMOTIONS', 'COPING STRATEGIES', 'PROJECT FAILURE', 'GRIEF RECOVERY', 'SENSEMAKING', 'MODEL', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'COMPLEXITY', 'ADJUSTMENT', 'PSYCHOLOGY']","['positive emotions', 'sensemaking']","['narratives', 'emotions']",0.0,0.0
"Boredom is an emotional state that has a long history in organizational research. Despite recent changes in technology and the organization of work, boredom remains a part of the experience of work. The available evidence indicates that boredom is associated mainly with negative individual and organizational outcomes. The authors organize the review of the antecedents of boredom around four major themes in the literature: boredom in relation to jobs; individual differences; social context; and goals and coping. The authors conclude that the major challenge for researchers is to provide an integrative account of boredom which subsumes multiple areas of research, and that one most promising avenue for future research requires further attention to boredom in relation to coping processes, pursuit and attainment of personal goals.","['nan', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'JOB CHARACTERISTICS', 'WORK ALIENATION', 'SENSATION SEEKING', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'YOUNG-ADULTS', 'PRONENESS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INFORMATION', 'EMOTIONS']",['individual differences'],[],0,0.0
"Despite the growing recognition in the corporate governance literature that the relationship between ownership concentration and profitability is context dependent, this issue has not yet been subjected to direct empirical investigation using a single cross-national sample. This study empirically examines the ownership concentration-performance relationship across the nations of Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United Stares. Essentially, we argue that the correlation (if any) between ownership concentration and firm profitability differs across countries in a systematic way determined by the national system of corporate governance.

"Many consumer price promotions (including new product launches) offer a product for free or for a low, discounted price along with a required purchase. This research demonstrates that consumers' willingness to pay for the product after the promotion is retracted is higher when it was offered for free than when it was offered at a low, discounted price. The underlying reasoning is that the price of the product on promotion is used as a natural anchor for value estimation. However, when the product is offered for free (i.e., zero price), consumers are less likely to consider the value of the product and are influenced by anchors such as the price of the focal purchase. In contrast to some prior findings, a free offer does not devalue the product at all and, at a minimum, devalues the product less than if it were offered for a low, discounted price.","['nan', 'WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY', 'PRICE', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'ANCHORS', 'BRAND']","['willingness to pay', 'price', 'anchors']","['price promotions', 'willingness to pay']",0.5,0.3333333333333333
"In You're Still the Same: Why Theories of Power Hold Over Time and Across Contexts, Jeffrey Pfeffer argues that one consequence of pursuing the new is a neglect of politics and theories of power that are symptomatic of a lack of scientific progress in management research. I agree that politics is an omnipresent feature of organization(s) and of management practice, but power and influence reach well beyond the surface mechanisms identified and naturalized by Professor Pfeffer. They extend to practices of sexism, racism, and colonialism as well as class. Thus, what is absent from You're Still the Same is a consideration of how, historically, power and influence are institutionalized in such practices, and how they may be diminished through emancipatory effort, including scientific practice.","['nan', 'MANAGEMENT', 'SLAVERY']",['management'],[],0,0.0
"Goal setting in family firms is very complex due to the interplay between family and business systems. However, this topic is largely overlooked in family business research. In this qualitative study of goals and goal formulation processes among 76 organizational members across 19 family firms, we identify goal diversity as a direct consequence of the overlap between the family, ownership, and business systems. We found that goal diversity is expressed more strongly in the proximity of generational transitions, triggering social interaction processes through which organizational members contrast their goals. Our findings suggest that different types of social interactions lead to different behaviors, with familial social interactions being more effective than professional social interactions in managing goal diversity toward the formation of collective commitment to family-centered goals.","['nan', 'COALITION-FORMATION', 'MULTILEVEL RESEARCH', 'AGENCY COSTS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'OWNERSHIP', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'PERSPECTIVES', 'CONSTRUCTS', 'SUCCESSION', 'JUSTICE']",['ownership'],"['firms', 'diversity']",0.0,0.0
"Reattachment to work (i.e., rebuilding a mental connection to work) before actually starting work is important for work engagement during the day. Building on motivated action theory, this study examines anticipated task focus, positive affect, and job resources (job control and social support) as mediators that translate reattachment in the morning into work engagement during the day. We collected daily-survey data from 151 employees (total of 620 days) and analyzed these data with a multilevel path model. We found that day-level reattachment to work in the morning predicted anticipated task focus, positive affect, social support, and job control through goal activation and that anticipated task focus, positive affect, social support, and job control predicted work engagement during the day. This study points to the important role of reattachment to work in employee experiences and behaviors throughout the workday and specifically highlights the benefits of such initial mental boundary crossing between life domains for employee engagement at work.","['reattachment', 'work engagement', 'goals', 'affect', 'job resources', 'multilevel modeling', 'SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY', 'JOB DEMANDS', 'NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY', 'AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCE', 'EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT', 'DAILY FLUCTUATIONS', 'MENTAL SIMULATION', 'TIME MANAGEMENT', 'STRESS', 'MODEL']","['reattachment', 'work engagement', 'affect', 'job resources', 'employee engagement', 'model']","['reattachment', 'work engagement', 'motivated action', 'task focus positive affect', 'job control', 'social support', 'goal activation']",0.2857142857142857,0.3333333333333333
"In this research, the authors propose a contagion effect of social media use across business suppliers, retailers, and consumers. After developing and validating social media usage measures at three levels-supplier, retailer, and customer-the authors test social media contagion effects and their ultimate impact on multiple performance measures. The conceptual framework and empirical results offer new insights into the contagion effects of social media usage across the channel of distribution as well as important social influence mechanisms that enhance these effects. Consistent with the predictions, social media use positively contributes to brand performance, retailer performance, and consumer-retailer loyalty. Also, the effect of supplier social media usage on retailer social media usage and in turn on customer social media usage is moderated by brand reputation and service ambidexterity. With the ever-increasing growth and adoption of social media applications and similar technologies, this research provides a framework to promote usage by supply channel partners which ultimately influences performance-related outcomes.","['Social media', 'Salespeople', 'Retailer', 'Contagion', 'Buyer-supplier relationships', 'Relationship marketing', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'CONTAGION', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'STRENGTH', 'PRODUCT', 'DIFFUSION', 'LOYALTY', 'SERVICE', 'AMBIDEXTERITY', 'ORIENTATION']","['social media', 'retailer', 'contagion', 'contagion', 'loyalty', 'service', 'ambidexterity']","['social media', 'brand reputation', 'ambidexterity']",0.6666666666666666,0.2857142857142857
"The majority of research and practice tends to conceptualize innovation as a vertically coupled, intra-organizational process. We expand this perspective by conceptualizing innovation as a vertically decoupled, inter-organizational process and by studying the role of research universities as suppliers of discoveries to this market for innovation. We combined logic from agency and real options theories to explain why the outcomes of technology commercialization are a function of licensing strategies, the autonomy of technology licensing offices (TLOs), and the incentives bestowed on scientists, research departments, and TLO officers. We rely on data from licensing surveys, interviews with 128 TLO directors, and - for convergent validity - from web-based searches of the TLOs of American universities and the US Patent and Trademark Office. Results suggest that commercialization outcomes (in this case, revenue and start-up creation) are enhanced when TLOs employ diverse licensing strategies, TLOs enjoy greater autonomy, universities share revenues with scientists' departments, and universities compensate TLOs officers well. Results also show that late entrants - typically underperforming universities - inflate royalty shares to scientists as a means to rectify their commercialization record. We conclude with a discussion of this study's contribution to the literature on innovation and technology commercialization.","['nan', 'UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY', 'ACADEMIC RESEARCH', 'TRANSFER OFFICES', 'REAL OPTIONS', 'EXPLORATION', 'EXPLOITATION', 'POLICY', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'FIRMS', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP']",['real options'],"['innovation', 'real options', 'technology commercialization']",0.3333333333333333,1.0
"This research attempts to investigate key drivers motivating corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices by small and medium sized foreign subsidiaries. By using stakeholder theory and regression analysis, we integrate international business and CSR literature to suggest a research model and identify the factors functioning as catalysts in influencing CSR in local markets. We find that consumers, 'internal managers and employees', competitors and non-governmental organizations are primary determinants considerably influencing corporate citizenship behavior particularly in emerging markets. We also believe that our model contributes to current knowledge by filling several research gaps, and our findings offer useful and practical implications not only for local governments but also for multinational enterprises.

"Retailers are increasingly offering hybrid bundles products that combine both good(s) and service(s). Some hybrid bundles, such as Lowe's flooring that combines flooring material (good) and flooring installation (service) are sold in traditional stores, while others, such as Best Buy's bundle that includes a computer (good) and tech support (service) are also offered online. The pricing strategy of a hybrid bundle is critical to its success. While pricing strategies for a goods bundle have been well-studied, those for a services bundle have been underexplored. Hybrid bundles, which fundamentally differ from bundles of goods or bundles of services, primarily with regard to quality variability and scalability, have received even less attention. Drawing from the pricing and bundling literatures for both goods and services, we develop an analytic model of optimal pricing for hybrid bundles by a monopolist retailer. We derive and illustrate many useful propositions, several of which are counter-intuitive. Our results show that an increase in quality variability of the service is associated with a higher optimal hybrid bundle price and a lower optimal price of the good, but a lower overall bundle profit. Our findings also reveal that the optimal price of the service (good) in a hybrid bundle is higher (lower) when the good has diminishing unit cost and the service has constant unit cost (i.e., the good is more scalable than the service). Our results also show that higher unit costs incurred to achieve lower service quality variability can result in higher (lower) profits when the cost increase is low (high). We discuss important implications of these insights for researchers and practitioners. (C) 2015 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These studies purport to demonstrate the presence of a systematic direct relationship between order of entry for products, brands, or businesses and market share.

A broadened perspective is presented that highlights the complexity of this phenomenon and suggests that first-mover status may or may not produce sustainable advantages because of a multiplicity of controllable and uncontrollable forces. A conceptual framework identifying factors that underlie first-mover advantage and product-market contingencies that moderate the order of entry-competitive advantage relationship is proffered.

It is then important to investigate why individuals choose self-employment. In addition to potential earnings, other factors may be considered, including displacement, uncertainty, unemployment risk, and dissatisfaction. Building on a job quits model, we propose an empirical representation of transitions to self-employment, which includes subjective evaluations of pecuniary and nonpecuniary satisfaction on the previous job.

"Organizational adaptive capability is a broad term and was studied from different perspectives, such as market, technology, and management system, in the management literature. However, the simultaneous effects of these different perspectives and their related adaptive capability constructs on a firm's product innovativeness have yet to be addressed. Additionally, an empirical study of the influence of informal structural dimensions, such as loose coupling, multiplexity, and redundancy, on the organizational adaptive capability, as antecedents, is also missing in the technology and innovation management (TIM) literature. By studying 153 firms, we found that (1) market-, technology-, and management system-related adaptive capability constructs simultaneously and positively impact firm product innovativeness; (2) under the loose coupling construct, autonomous behaviors of departments positively impact technology and management system adaptive capability, loose management style influences market and management system adaptive capability, and uneven/slow information travel in organizations negatively affects technology and management system adaptive capability; (3) multiplexity positively influences all organizational adaptive capability constructs; and (4) under the redundancy construct, information distribution redundancy has an n shape relationship with technology adaptive capability. We also demonstrated that the impact of informal structural constructs on adaptive capability is contingent upon environmental turbulence, e.g., rapid or unanticipated changes in market and technology. We found that the influence of loose management style on technology adaptive capability decreases with increased rate of market turbulence, and the effect of resource slack, as a part of the redundancy construct, on technology adaptive capability changes quadratically, an n shaped curve, with an increased rate of market turbulence. We further found that the effect of the autonomous behaviors of departments on market adaptive capability increases with an increased level of technology turbulence. The role of resource slack on the market adaptive capability was also found to change quadratically, an n shaped curve, with an increased rate of technology turbulence. Interestingly, the impact of the information distribution redundancy on market adaptive capability changes nonlinearly, a U shaped curve, with an increased rate of technology turbulence. Further, we showed that the influence of organizational technology adaptive capability on product innovativeness increases with increased level of technology turbulence.

"By breaking down the walls among the R&D, manufacturing, and marketing functions, techniques such as concurrent engineering and quality function deployment can pave the way to more effective new product development (NPD). Recognizing the benefits of such cross-functional efforts, practitioners and researchers have examined the interrelationships among various groups in the NPD process, paying particularly close attention to the RED-marketing interface. However, manufacturing also plays an important role in NPD. Consequently, any thorough exploration of the relationship between cross-functional cooperation and NPD success must consider manufacturing's perspective. X. Michael Song, Mitzi M. Montoya-Weiss, and Jeffrey B. Schmidt provide such a balanced perspective in a study of cross-functional cooperation during NPD in Mexican high-tech firms. Notwithstanding the differing functional goals, objectives, and reward systems present in R&D, manufacturing and marketing, they hypothesize that all three functions recognize that successful NPD requires crossfunctional cooperation. In particular, they expect that representatives of these three functional groups will share similar perceptions, regarding both the drivers and the consequences of cross-functional cooperation. The survey results support the hypothesis that R&D, manufacturing, and marketing professionals share the same perceptions, regarding the drivers and the consequences of cross-functional cooperation. Respondents from all three groups view internal facilitators as the drivers of cross-functional cooperation. In other words, regardless of their functional area, the survey respondents believe that the strongest, most direct effects on cross-functional cooperation and NPD performance come from a firm's evaluation criteria, reward structures, and management expectations. Respondents perceive these internal facilitators as having a greater effect on cross-functional cooperation than that of external forces such as market competitiveness and technological change. In fact, contrary to expectations, the respondents do not view these external forces as having a significant effect on cross-functional cooperation or NPD performance. And contrary to persistent reports about friction between technical and nontechnical personnel, all three groups perceive a strong, positive relationship between cross-functional communication and NPD performance.","['nan', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS', 'HIGH-TECHNOLOGY FIRMS', 'INDUSTRIAL', 'INTERFACE', 'MODEL', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'INFORMATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'VARIABLES']","['interface', 'performance']","['interface', 'cross functional cooperation']",0.5,0.5
"In several industries, projects are now the normal form of work for individuals. The consequences of project work have not so far been subject to critical inquiry, however. This implies inquiry not only on how people handle project work at work, it also means inquiring into how they live their lives when working by projects. In this paper, we study this from a constructionist gender perspective, in which project work is seen as an ongoing construction of patterns of femininity and masculinity in society. The aim of the paper is to contribute to an understanding of how project work is related to the ongoing construction of femininity and masculinity in the work and lives of human beings. From a narrative study of individuals in the same project team in an IT-consultancy company, we discuss masculinization and femininization in project-based work. It appears that current project work practices imply reproduction of masculinities such as rationality, efficiency, control, devotion to work etc, while femininization is instead found in the rhetoric of the organizational context and the expectations on newly recruited women. The organization was in the process of femininization through rhetoric on 'family friendliness', but everyday life for consultants was not spent at the organization but in project teams in the customers' offices. Projects are special in the sense that they are clearly delimited episodes of work in which it is possible to apply entirely different norms than 'outside' the project - which makes the tendency to reproduce traditional masculinities even stronger.","['nan', 'MASCULINITIES']",['masculinities'],['gender'],0.0,0.0
"Technologies are becoming increasingly autonomous, able to make decisions and complete tasks on behalf of consumers. Virtual assistants already take care of grocery shopping by replenishing used up ingredients while cooking machines prepare these ingredients and implement recipes. In the future, consumers will be able to delegate substantial parts of the shopping process to autonomous shopping systems. Where as the functional benefits of these systems are evident, they challenge psychological consumption motives and ingrained human-machine relationships due to the delegation of decisions and tasks to technology. The authors take a cross-disciplinary approach drawing from research in marketing, psychology, and human-computer interaction to examine barriers to adoption of autonomous shopping systems. They identify different types of psychological and cultural barriers, and suggest ways to craft the online and bricks-and-mortar retail environment to overcome these barriers along the consumer journey.

"Privatization, especially in developing countries, presents international firms with opportunities for market entry and growth, but acquirers have to consider the distinct characteristics of a state owned enterprise (SOE) and the influence of the government as seller and policy maker. This study introduces a model, based on mergers and acquisitions literature and microeconomic theory, that explains the critical relationships among characteristics of the SOE, the government, and the acquirer. Public administration research suggests that the critical characteristics of SOEs are their sources of funding and their mode of social control of the organization, and recent work in privatizing countries emphasizes the influence of the government. The theoretical framework for the model suggested here is derived from research within the field of strategic management on mergers and acquisitions. The paper develops propositions regarding the organizational fit between private firms and those heretofore owned by governments and discusses research and managerial implications.","['nan', 'INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'INTEGRATION', 'COUNTRIES', 'WEALTH', 'FIRMS']","['countries', 'firms']",['mergers and acquisitions'],0.0,0.0
"Purpose As supply chain sustainability has become more urgent than ever before, this study aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of how supplying firms' sustainability motives influence their compliance and commitment, as well as sustainable performance, as they respond to buyers' sustainable supplier management programs. Design/methodology/approach To investigate the intriguing links among sustainability motives, compliance/commitment and sustainable performance of supplying firms, this paper draws on multidisciplinary literature and collects empirical data from 281 supplying firms in China to test the proposed model and hypotheses using structural equation modeling. Findings Instrumental and moral motives make comparable contributions to compliance; moral motives exert stronger influence on firms' commitment to sustainable practices. In addition, although compliance has a greater impact on economic and environmental performance, commitment is far more robust in improving environmental and social performance. Research limitations/implications - Unlike most research on motives that has been theoretical, this study represents one of the few empirical analyses of how motives may affect sustainable performance. Examining the challenges from the perspectives of supplying firms, it also adds to the SSCM literature by making clear how compliance and commitment may differentially predict sustainable performance. Practical implications - Although instrumental and moral motives can be complementary in advancing sustainable practices, it is imperative for firms to integrate moral considerations into sustainability decision-making and move beyond compliance, if they are to contribute meaningfully to a better society and cleaner environment. Originality/value This is the first large-scale empirical investigation on the links among motives, compliance, commitment and sustainable performance from the perspectives of suppliers.","['Sustainable supply chain practices', 'Motives', 'Compliance', 'Commitment', 'Sustainable supplier management', 'Sustainable performance', 'CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'GREEN MANAGEMENT MATTERS', 'MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES', 'ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE EVIDENCE', 'DRIVERS', 'CAPABILITIES', 'GOVERNANCE', 'LEGITIMACY', 'MOTIVATION']","['motives', 'compliance', 'commitment', 'sustainable supplier management', 'sustainable performance']","['sustainability', 'compliance', 'commitment', 'china']",0.5,0.4
"To explain resource heterogeneity, past research focuses on how rivals' resources are hidden from firms and firms accordingly have difficulties accessing them. We argue that resource heterogeneity may also arise when firms are deterred from a technological space upon being shown what resources rivals already possess within that space. To illustrate this deterrence effect, we use patent reexamination certificates, which indicate strategic stakes within a technological space without materially disclosing additional details of the underlying technologies and hence avoid the confounding effect of attracting competition through disclosure. We demonstrate how rivals' reexamination certificates within a technological space induce a firm to subsequently allocate less inventive effort in that space, based on two mechanisms-indications of rivals' developmental speed and exclusionary, ability. We further develop these two mechanisms by arguing that the deterrence effect is stronger when rivals' speed is enhanced by their downstream capabilities, or when rivals' exclusion is enhanced by their litigation experiences. Findings suggest that a firm's path of resource accumulation evolves through avoidance of rivals' paths, and deterrence may constitute a viable alternative theory of resource heterogeneity.

"Flat-rate pricing, as opposed to charging customers for actual usage, dominates many service industries (e.g., telecommunications, health clubs, and music streaming), and customers often express a flat-rate bias and choose flat rates even if a pay-per-use tariff would be less expensive for them. However, evidence of the effect of this bias on churn is mixed. The competitive market position of a service provider may represent a relevant contingency factor related to this effect; building on attribution theory, the current study predicts that customers attribute their flat-rate bias differently, depending on service providers' strategic positioning, which leads to varying churn behavior. A survival analysis of approximately 2 years' transactional data gathered from 21,490 customers of a premium Internet service provider affirms that a flat-rate bias leads to churn in the premium segment. Two experimental studies show that customers of premium service providers attribute their flat-rate bias more externally and exhibit lower fairness perceptions but increased churn intentions compared to low-cost customers who make internal attributions and who thus have less negative perceptions and lower churn intentions. Therefore, premium service managers must proactively manage customers who exhibit flat-rate biases to prevent their negative reactions. Low-cost providers generally have less need for such action and can benefit from flat rates without risking increased churn, despite higher price sensitivity of their customers.","['flat-rate pricing', 'flat-rate bias', 'churn', 'competitive market position', 'CONSUMER PRICE SENSITIVITY', 'LOCAL TELEPHONE SERVICE', 'FAIRNESS PERCEPTIONS', 'ATTRIBUTIONAL APPROACH', 'GENERIC STRATEGIES', 'TARIFF STRUCTURE', 'MODEL', 'USAGE', 'FRAMEWORK', 'RETENTION']","['flat rate pricing', 'flat rate bias', 'churn', 'competitive market position', 'fairness perceptions', 'usage']","['churn', 'attribution theory', 'churn behavior', 'survival analysis', 'fairness perceptions', 'churn intentions']",0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333

Our results show that heterogeneity is generally better for learning, as prior heterogeneity in the causes of errors decreases subsequent accident rates, producing a deeper, broader search for causality than simple explanations like blame the pilot. The benefits of heterogeneity, however, apply mainly to specialist airlines. Generalist airlines learn, instead, from outside factors such as the experience of others and general improvements in technology. These results suggest a theory of learning across organizational forms: complex forms benefit from simple information, and simple forms benefit from complex information. The implications of our study for learning theories and work on organizational errors are discussed.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'NICHE WIDTH', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EXPERIENCE', 'INDUSTRY', 'FAILURE', 'DIVERSITY', 'DYNAMICS', 'SAFETY', 'POWER']",['experience'],[],0,0.0
"The study reported here uses a population ecology approach to examine whether bureaucratic rules breed more rules. Hypotheses about the birth rate of bureaucratic rules are derived and tested with time series data on rule production in a large U.S. research university. Results show that the rate of rule production declines with the number of rules in a rule population over time. The results support organizational learning theories: by expanding the number of rules, organizations increasingly respond to environmental challenges in a programmed way, reducing organizational experiences with new situations, inhibiting organizational learning, and thereby eliminating a main impetus for making more rules. Radical bureaucratization theories, however, are not supported.(.)","['nan', 'POPULATION', 'DYNAMICS', 'INDUSTRY', 'MODELS']",['population'],[],0,0.0
"International marketing studies have extensively examined the antecedents of firms' marketing standardization/adaptation decisions. However, it is unclear whether such decisions, once planned, codetermine the choice between buying and building foreign subsidiaries. Analyzing a sample of 150 foreign entries by Dutch firms, the authors find that the level of marketing adaptation planned for a wholly owned subsidiary is positively related to the likelihood that the subsidiary will be established through an acquisition rather than through a green field investment. Moreover, the authors find substantial evidence that this positive relationship is stronger for firms that (1) are establishing relatively larger subsidiaries, (2) have less experience with the industry entered, or (3) are entering less developed countries. The findings show that firms pursuing higher levels of marketing adaptation assign more value to the marketing adaptation advantages of acquisitions over greenfields, especially if the risks associated with implementing the planned adaptation level are high. In addition, firms typically strive for a fit between their international marketing strategy and their mode of foreign establishment.","['acquisitions', 'establishment mode choice', 'greenfields', 'planned marketing adaptation', 'ENTRY MODE CHOICE', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'START-UP', 'INTERNATIONAL STANDARDIZATION', 'JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES', 'TRANSACTION COSTS', 'NATIONAL CULTURE', 'STRATEGIC FIT', 'REAL OPTIONS', 'PERFORMANCE']","['acquisitions', 'greenfields']","['standardization', 'wholly owned subsidiary', 'advantages', 'strategy']",0.0,0.0
"Could directly touching food with hands make it tastier and more desirable? The present paper presents four studies that explore how sampling and eating food by touching it directly with hands affects hedonic evaluations and consumption volume. The studies demonstrate that for consumers who apply self-control in their food consumption (high self-control consumers) touching food directly with hands enhances the sensory experience and increases hedonic evaluations of the food. Importantly, direct touch increases the consumption volume for high self-control consumers. These findings contribute to understanding of how touch as a proximal sensory factor affects food evaluation and consumption, and thus offer retailing implications in the context of in-store food sampling, food catering, presentation and consumption of food in restaurants.

"Can state governance spur firm innovation in an emerging economy and transform state-owned enterprises (SOEs) from dying dinosaurs to dynamic dynamos? We seek an answer to this question by investigating the innovative performance of restructured SOEs in China's high-speed train sector. We expect that SOE restructuration will improve firm innovation, but that the degree of improvement will depend on how the state conducts firm governance. Building on institutional theory, we distinguish state governance via equity ownership and administrative affiliation in an emerging economy with market-hierarchy institutional conflicts. Under such conflicts, restructured SOEs experienceinstitutional logic dissonance, which hinders organizational change for technological innovation. We hypothesize that state ownership exacerbates institutional logic dissonance at a restructured SOE, thus limiting innovation improvement from restructuration; in contrast, state affiliation mitigates firm dissonance and hence augments such improvement. We find empirical evidence for these hypotheses in a comprehensive panel of high-speed train manufacturers in China between 1989 and 2015. This study contributes to the institution-based theory of technological innovation in emerging economies. On the practical front, our findings suggest that emerging states may adopt arms-length governance to spur SOE innovation and unleash these dynamic dynamos to fuel sustainable economic growth.","['institutional theory', 'corporate governance in emerging markets', 'innovation and R&D', 'SOE restructuration', 'administrative affiliation', 'Chinese high-speed train', 'FIRM INNOVATION', 'KNOWLEDGE NETWORKS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MARKET', 'INCENTIVES', 'OWNERSHIP', 'DYNAMICS', 'COLLABORATION', 'ENTREPRENEURS', 'TRANSITION']","['institutional theory', 'soe restructuration', 'administrative affiliation', 'firm innovation', 'performance', 'market', 'ownership']","['state governance', 'china', 'institutional theory', 'equity ownership', 'technological innovation', 'innovation']",0.16666666666666666,0.14285714285714285
"New products are often incongruent with consumer expectations. Researchers have shown that consumers prefer moderately incongruent products, while being adverse to extremely incongruent products. Evidence from three studies suggests that this phenomenon is highly influenced by a consumer's state of arousal. Specifically, low arousal decreases preference for moderate incongruity while increasing preference for extreme incongruity, whereas high arousal decreases preference for any form of incongruity. Underlying these effects are discrete emotional states brought on by a physiological response to incongruity. Varying arousal subsequently varies the severity of the emotion, be it negative (anxiety) or positive (curiosity), which in turn varies evaluations for the product. This suggests that creating excitement around a product launch may be good for incremental innovation, but it may not be a good idea for something truly innovative.","['nan', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'SCHEMA CONGRUITY', 'CUE UTILIZATION', 'MEMORY', 'ACTIVATION', 'EMOTION', 'INCONGRUITY', 'EXTENSIONS', 'PERSUASION', 'EXPERIENCE']","['emotion', 'incongruity']","['expectations', 'arousal', 'anxiety', 'curiosity', 'innovation']",0.0,0.0
"Over the past several years corporate entrepreneurship has been widely touted by executives and researchers alike as an effective means for revitalizing companies and improving their financial performance. For the most part, the call for greater entrepreneurial behavior on the part of established companies has been accepted on faith as an inherently desirable objective. The implicit logic behind the pervasive belief in the value of corporate entrepreneurship seems to be that risk taking, innovation, and aggressive competitive action-in the key elements of entrepreneurial corporations-will help in identifying and pursuing lucrative product/market opportunities and in providing new bases for achieving superior competitive positions. But what do we really know about the financial consequences of corporate entrepreneurship? Most of the evidence that corporate entrepreneurship ''pays off'' is anecdotal in nature or based on cross-sectional studies that focus on the short-term implications of entrepreneurical behaviors. As such, in a definitive sense, we know very little about the financial consequences of corporate entrepreneurship. In an attempt to improve our understanding of this issue, this article describes a study of corporate entrepreneurship and its impact on company financial performance. Data were collected from three different samples over a seven-year period to assess the longitudinal impact of corporate entrepreneurship on firm performance. These samples consist of 24 medium-sized manufacturing firms representing 14 industry segments, 39 chemical companies, and 45 Fortune 500 industrial firms representing five industry segments. Data were gathered on each sample using both primary and secondary sources. Regression analysis was then used to analyze the data. The results suggest that corporate entrepreneurship has a positive impact on financial measures of company performance. This effect on performance, which tends to be modest over the first few years, increases over time, suggesting that corporate entrepreneurship may, indeed, be a generally effective means for improving long-term company financial performance. Moreover, the results indicate that corporate entrepreneurship is a particularly effective practice among companies operating in hostile environments (as opposed to benign environments). The study has three principal implications for practicing managers. First, the study documents the general financial viability of engaging in corporate entrepreneurship. This is not to suggest that corporate entrepreneurship is a panacea for improving financial performance. However, entrepreneurial behavior, when considered on the whole (i.e., across firms and industries), is associated with superior financial performance. Second, the study suggests a need to use a long-term time horizon in order to adequately judge the financial consequences of corporate entrepreneurship. The use of a shorter evaluation period may not allow sufficient time for entrepreneurial actions to have their full market and corresponding financial impact. Finally, the study identifies the context-specific character of effective entrepreneurial practice. Specifically, corporate entrepreneurship appears to be a particularly effective strategic practice among firms operating in hostile business settings.","['nan', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'INNOVATION', 'FIRMS', 'VENTURES', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'DIMENSIONS', 'MODELS']","['innovation', 'firms', 'environments']",[],0,0.0

We examine 1726 crowdfunding campaigns from Kickstarter, finding that entrepreneurs conveying positive psychological capital experience superior fundraising performance. Human capital moderates this relationship while social capital does not, suggesting that costly signals may, at times, enhance the influence of costless signals.

"Marketers often base decisions about marketing strategies on the results of research designed to elicit information about consumers' preferences. A large body of research indicates, however, that preferences often are labile. That is, preferences can be reversed depending on factors such as how the preference is elicited. In three studies, we examine the effect of familiarity in two preference-elicitation tasks, choice and matching judgments. We provide evidence of an interaction between familiarity and response mode (choice or matching) in each study. In study 3, we test the explanation that preference reversals may occur when the interaction of response mode with product-category familiarity leads to systematic changes in attribute weighting.","['nan', 'CHOICE', 'REVERSALS', 'INFORMATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'EXPERIENCE', 'DECISIONS']","['choice', 'reversals', 'information', 'decisions']",[],0,0.0
"Multinationality refers to the extent to which firms' business activities span across national borders. Moving beyond prior emphasis on the consequences of multinational expansion, this study sheds light on the antecedents by analyzing how firm resources influence changes in multinationality. Building on the resource-based view of the firm, we propose a framework that consists of resource determinants in two categories: knowledge-based and property-based resources. Empirical results obtained from a sample of publicly held US manufacturing companies show that knowledge-based resources generate faster and longer-lasting influences on international growth than property-based resources. Specifically, resources related to technological and marketing knowledge, and property-based resources related to organizational slack and internally generated profits, are found to be significant driving forces behind growth in multinationality. This study not only advances our understanding of the antecedents of multinational expansion, but also provides implications and avenues for future research.","['multinationality', 'international growth', 'resource-based view', 'INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER', 'BRITISH MANUFACTURING COMPANIES', 'FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'MARKET ENTRY MODE', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL SLACK', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'SERVICE FIRMS', 'UNITED-STATES']","['multinationality', 'international growth', 'resource based view', 'organizational slack']","['multinationality', 'resource based view', 'knowledge', 'organizational slack']",0.75,0.75

"This study analyzes the marketplace performances that are enacted in the field of women's flat track roller derby using the theoretical lens of gender performativity. Rather than treating the roller derby field as an autonomous enclave of gender resistance, this study focuses on the interrelationships between derby grrrls' resignifying performances of femininity and the gender constraints that have been naturalized in their everyday lives. The market-mediated nature of derby grrrls' ideological edgework enables them to challenge orthodox gender boundaries, without losing sociocultural legitimacy. This analysis casts new theoretical light on the gendered habitus and reveals key differences to the outcomes that would follow from Bourdieusian assumptions about the deployment of cultural capital in zero-sum status competitions. The concept of ideological edgework also presents a theoretical alternative to critical arguments, such as the commodity feminism thesis, that assume an inherently paradoxical and, ultimately co-opting, relationship exists between practices of countercultural resistance and marketplace performances. We further argue that ideological edgework redresses some of the conceptual ambiguities that can lead gender researchers to conflate gender performativity with social performances.","['consumer culture theory', 'marketplace performances', 'gender', 'consumer identity projects', 'the sociology of consumption', 'consumer resistance', 'CONSUMER RESEARCH', 'ROLLER DERBY', 'CONSUMPTION PRACTICES', 'REAL BEAUTY', 'BURNING MAN', 'GENDER', 'CULTURE', 'AGENCY', 'EXPERIENCE', 'IDENTITY']","['marketplace performances', 'gender', 'roller derby', 'gender']","['roller derby', 'derby grrrls', 'feminism', 'social performances']",0.25,0.25
"Women, who have historically been less represented than men in leadership positions, emerge as leaders in some societies more than others. Unlike previous cultural explanations for this effect (rooted in differences in values, practices, or gender roles), we argue that a culture's tightness - its strength of norms and social sanctions - can provoke a resistance to change practices that historically placed men in leadership positions. Tighter cultures will yield fewer women represented among top leadership positions. Moreover, cultural tightness moderates the degree to which egalitarian practices - where individuals from both genders are treated equally - lead women to emerge as leaders. Specifically, differences in egalitarian practices are more likely to predict the emergence of women as leaders among tight rather than loose cultures because such practices are more strongly implemented in tight than weak cultures. Analysis of publicly available data reveals some preliminary support for predictions. This research concludes that loose cultures will be more receptive to changing existing cultural practices, but that tight cultures are more successful in implementing and sustaining such changes.

"This article explores the provision of extraordinary hedonic experiences on commercial, multiday river rafting trips in the Colorado River basin. White water river rafting provides a dramatic illustration of some of the complex features of delivering an extraordinary experience. Multiple methods were employed over two years of data collection to articulate the lived meaning of this experience from both the guides' and the consumers' perspectives. Robust quantitative measures were developed from rich qualitative data. Participant observation and interview data enriched the interpretation of quantitative results. Experiential themes of personal growth and self-renewal, ''communitas,'' and harmony with nature are evidenced across the data; they evolve and are woven together over the course of the trip. Together they are significant in explaining overall satisfaction. There is a complex relationship between client expectations and satisfaction. The narrative of the ratting experience rather than relationships between expectations and outcomes is shown to be central to its evaluation.

"Over the last three decades, customer experience (CE) has developed from a burgeoning concept to a widely recognized phenomenon in terms of both research and practice. To account for the complexity of consumption decisions, the CE literature encompasses both the rational information processing approach to consumer decision-making and the experiential approach, which includes emotions, feelings and sub-consciousness. The authors classify and examine CE research on two levels. Studies on static CE analyze experiences during touchpoints at one point in time, while studies on dynamic CE assess how experiences evolve over time. Furthermore, both static and dynamic CE research take place from two distinct theoretical perspectives: the organization and the consumer. As both theoretical perspectives essentially deal with the same phenomenon - the organizational perspective with the creation of CEs and the consumer perspective with the perception of customer experiences - there is potential for a productive symbiosis between them. The authors propose that connecting insights from both perspectives can contribute to a better understanding of what constitutes a CE for consumers and how firms can effectively manage it. First, the authors discuss the development of CE and argue that it has evolved into a broad and fragmented umbrella construct'. Second, after distinguishing and defining static and dynamic CE, they systematically evaluate the state of knowledge in both the organizational and consumer perspectives. Finally, they develop an agenda for future research that integrates the consumer perspective into organizational CE research.","['nan', 'SERVICE EXPERIENCE', 'CONSUMPTION EXPERIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SURROUNDINGS', 'DOMINANT LOGIC', 'AMBIENT SCENT', 'RETAIL', 'SATISFACTION', 'ENCOUNTERS', 'EMOTIONS', 'IMPACT']",['emotions'],"['customer experience', 'emotions', 'touchpoints', 'knowledge']",0.25,1.0

"This paper considers some developments within Russian privatized industrial firms 1992-94 through the lens of Stakeholder-Agency Theory (SAT). Although it has its own shortcomings and weaknesses, SAT, unlike the traditional financial version of Agency Theory, at least contemplates the possibility of a transitional period during which enterprise governance structures can evolve. It is by now widely recognised that in the middle of deep economic crisis, the Russian economy is too volatile for longitudinal studies of formally structured samples of firms over a period of time. In any case, SAT is at a stage of development that has not yet yielded detailed predictions for scientific testing. Yet surveys of recently privatized firms in Russia do provide empirical data away from the origins of SAT, and it is argued that this fresh data suggests new research propositions that can hopefully lead to more theoretical refinement and ultimately testing. At the very least, SAT can be used as a heuristic device, capable of providing a way of looking at complex Russian developments in a structured way. A process of Russian privatization through management-employee buy-outs involving giveaway distributions of shares has secured the compliance of the two main groups of enterprise stakeholders who could have prevented the withdrawal of the State from the governance of industrial enterprises, but has not yet produced a form of corporate governance structure that is likely to survive in the long term without State protection. In the longer term, international competitiveness can only be secured in Russia through investment in new products and processes, and the inadequacies of managers and other employees as sources of investable funds mean that incumbents must generate a more welcoming climate for outside investors. Even after such a short period since privatization and in the middle of a deep economic crisis, some enterprises are already favouring more efficient governance structures in a way consistent with SAT.","['nan', 'UNITED-STATES', 'BUY-OUTS', 'OWNERSHIP', 'PRIVATIZATION', 'PRIVATISATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'GERMANY', 'COSTS', 'JAPAN']","['buy outs', 'privatization']",['privatization'],1.0,0.5

"We compare person-to-person service encounters with those in which the service provider is an information system to identify the capabilities needed to personalize a service encounter. We suggest substituting information for interaction as a principle that unifies these different types of encounters whenever the information needed to create value in a service system accumulates incrementally through human or automated customer interactions. We review research and practice in computer science, artificial intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and information systems design to bring an interdisciplinary robustness to our conceptual proposal. Human service providers and automated service systems both need (1) a service model manager that stores information about how a customer requests a service; (2) a customer model manager that stores information about customers and preferences; (3) a recommendation system manager that uses service models, customer models, and contextual information to adapt the service at delivery time; (4) a learning system that analyzes previous service encounters to refine service and customer models, and a (5) service monitoring system that monitors the status of service delivery. The substitution concepts and mechanisms we propose highlight the range of design choices and help managers evaluate whether a human interaction or information exchange creates or undermines value in a service system.","['personalization', 'serice encounter', 'service systems design', 'information models', 'customer models', 'technology-based services', 'SELF-SERVICE', 'WEB']",['customer models'],"['customer interactions', 'system']",0.0,0.0

Using a framework based on sensory marketing and Dual Coding Theory, we conducted 2 one-way between-subjects experiments with a two-level interface interaction considering a hedonic product (Experiment 1) and utilitarian product (Experiment 2). Findings confirm a three-way interaction such that the impact of privacy concern on the relationship between personal engagement and trust depends on the nature of the platform interaction; touch vs. combined touch and voice.

"This paper raises the question and provides empirical evidence regarding the status of the evolution of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China today. In this study, we compare the SOEs to domestic private-owned enterprises (POEs) and foreign-controlled businesses (FCBs) in the context of their organizational cultures. While a new ownership form, many of the POEs evolved from former collectives that reflect the traditional values of Chinese business. Conversely, the FCBs are much more indicative of the large global MNCs. Therefore, we look at the SOES in the context of these two reference points. We conclude that the SOEs of today have substantially transformed to approximate a configuration desired by the Chinese government when it began the SOE transformation a couple of decades ago to make them globally competitive.

"Manufacturing firms seek continuous supplier performance improvement because this outcome makes them more competitive in downstream markets. Although manufacturing firms use a range of tools to effect continuous supplier performance improvement, the author focuses on two that are especially important-collaborative communication and control-and poses the following research questions: (1) How does collaborative communication foster continuous supplier performance improvement? and (2) What are the combined effects of collaborative communication and control? The results from a survey of 153 manufacturer-supplier dyads show that collaborative communication fosters continuous supplier performance improvement by enhancing supplier knowledge (of manufacturer needs) and by building supplier affective commitment (toward the manufacturer). With respect to the combined effects of communication and control, the results show that capability control enhances the positive effects of both supplier knowledge and supplier affective commitment on continuous supplier performance improvement, whereas process control undermines the effect of supplier knowledge on the outcome. This pattern of results suggests that manufacturing firms should emphasize capability control and deemphasize process control to foster continuous supplier performance improvement.","['manufacturer-supplier relationships', 'collaborative communication', 'capability control', 'continuous improvement', 'DISTRIBUTOR COMMITMENT', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'INDUSTRIAL CHANNELS', 'INTEGRATED MODEL', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'JOINT ACTION', 'STRATEGIES', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'OPPORTUNISM']","['collaborative communication', 'capability control']","['communication', 'control', 'knowledge']",0.0,0.0

Eight hundred ninth graders watched either original movie footage with smoking or control footage with the smoking edited out. Emotional reactions were recorded during viewing, and smoking-related thoughts, beliefs, and intent were assessed afterward. The findings support the Forbidden Fruit thesis, in that smoking (versus nonsmoking) scenes positively aroused the young viewers, enhanced their perceptions of smokers' social stature, and increased their intent to smoke. However, youths' opinions were malleable, and showing them an antismoking advertisement before the film effectively repositioned the smoking from forbidden to tainted, thereby nullifying the aforementioned effects, No support was obtained for the Excitation Transfer theory, which predicts that the positive arousal evoked by movie scenes would transfer to smokers who were depicted in those scenes.

We find that some of the core propositions of the resource-based view do not necessarily hold when the impact of resource deployment on product market competition is explicitly considered.

Such a framework should provide valuable insights that international marketers can use to identify differences in the perception of ethical norms across nationalities and, thus, to design more effective and efficient international marketing and management strategies.","['nan', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'BUSINESS STUDENTS', 'NATIONAL CULTURE', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'DIMENSIONS', 'INTERESTS', 'KOREA']",['dimensions'],"['ethics', 'united states']",0.0,0.0
"Social tolerance refers to the extent of recognition and acceptance of differences, willingness to grant equal rights, and refraining from openly intolerant attitudes. Utilizing World Value Survey (WVS) data (56 countries, 83,000 usable respondents), we develop a Global Social Tolerance Index (GSTI) that incorporates gender, minority, immigrant, and religion tolerance dimensions. We develop this index using a multi-step data-driven procedure involving five data standardizations, seven weighting approaches, and five aggregation methods. They generate 124 replications for each country's index and rank, yielding a median overall position and several measures of rank sensitivity/robustness to different weighting, standardization, and aggregation approaches. It builds on prior social tolerance indexes in terms of scope and dimensionality, and avoids problems associated with equal or subjective weighting. The GSTI index/rankings provide a tool for IB scholars to examine nations' overall tolerance or tolerance regarding each dimension relative to other external criteria. Our procedure can be used to develop other indexes and rankings of nations or organizations within a country or region. In practice, any such non-participatory method should always serve as a starting point to facilitate deliberations of experts and/or decision-makers for policy recommendations.","['indices and rankings', 'measurement and scale development issues', 'social tolerance', 'gender equality', 'immigration and minorities', 'religion', 'MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS', 'CULTURAL DISTANCE', 'ATTITUDES', 'BUSINESS', 'VALUES', 'GLOBALIZATION', 'RELIGIOSITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'IMMIGRANT']","['social tolerance', 'religion', 'attitudes', 'immigrant']","['social tolerance', 'world', 'rankings']",0.3333333333333333,0.25
"We examine egocentric biases in mental accounting that occur when consumers face the prospect of disclosing personal information in exchange for online marketing incentives. We find that consumers keep balanced mental accounts of the costs and benefits of such exchanges when they are contingent or temporally integrated. However, when non-contingent exchanges are temporally separated so that benefits precede costs, or when bias correction is impeded in the same non-contingent transaction, consumers keep separate mental accounts in which they egocentrically devalue the marketers' incentives, making them less likely to reciprocate by disclosing. We explore consequences of these findings for online relationships between consumers and marketers.

"Excess CEO returns refer to CEO financial returns in excess of shareholder returns. How do boards rein in excess CEO returns? Introducing a social capital view of board monitoring, we suggest that boards face two competing normative pressurescorporate elite norms and monitoring norms. How boards conform to such normative pressures for controlling excess CEO returns is affected by their external and internal social capital. Further, we substantiate our arguments by showing that powerful CEOs and institutional investors may facilitate or constrain the normative pressures existing in the social network and alter the effects of board social capital on excess CEO returns.

"This study examines the roles played by the environment and realized strategies on firm-level performance in the Japanese machine tool industry. We examine the effect of environment and strategy on performance using longitudinal data on a sample of 25 Japanese machine tool firms over the period 1979-92. Our results indicate that both firm strategies and the environment play significant roles in influencing profitability and growth. More specifically, whereas both strategy and environmental variables are significantly related to firm profitability, only environmental variables are associated with firm growth. Additionally, in contrast to U.S.-based studies, we find that capital expenditures and technological change are not negatively associated with profitability. Rather technological change has a positive impact on firm growth. We discuss the implications of these results for strategic management and provide suggestions for future research.","['JAPANESE MACHINE TOOL INDUSTRY', 'ENVIRONMENT AND STRATEGY', 'TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND STRATEGY', 'TECHNOLOGICAL DISCONTINUITIES', 'BUSINESS PERFORMANCE', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'COMPETITION', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'MODEL']","['japanese machine tool industry', 'environment and strategy']",[],0,0.0
"The current research investigates the role of fear in the creation of emotional attachment to a brand. Previous research examining the influence of incidental negative emotions on brand evaluations has generally found that negative emotions lead to negative evaluations. The current research suggests that for fear, the relationship may be more positive. Since people cope with fear through affiliation with others, in the absence of other individuals, consumers may seek affiliation with an available brand. This, in turn, will enhance emotional attachment to that brand. Four studies demonstrate that consumers who experience fear in the presence of a brand feel greater emotional brand attachment than consumers who experience other emotions such as happiness, sadness, or excitement. The findings from the research advance understanding of consumer-brand relationships by demonstrating that relationships between consumers and brands are not merely metaphorical. Rather, under certain circumstances, brands can actually fulfill interpersonal psychological needs.","['nan', 'PROTECTION MOTIVATION', 'MOOD MANAGEMENT', 'APPEALS', 'ATTITUDE', 'STRESS', 'CONSUMERS', 'ANXIETY', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'CONSUMPTION', 'COGNITION']",['consumers'],[],0,0.0

"Prior research on product out-of-stock (OOS) has mainly focused on the consequences of OOS due to consumers not being able to select their target options. The present research explores how OOS noticed by consumers without a specific target option in mind affects their preference among the in-stock options. We find that consumers can draw social inferences from OOS about the desirability of product features. Consequently, in-stock options that share feature with the OOS option enjoys choice advantage. We show that this effect occurs only when the OOS condition is caused by consumer demand (as opposed to by logistical causes), and only for consumers who are not product category experts. Further, consumers' belief on others' expertise and shopping goal determines which specific feature they will identify as the key feature that drives the OOS. These findings provide a more complete picture for how consumers respond to OOS. They also offer insights into making more accurate demand estimation and suggest a potential new tool for in-store marketing. (c) 2015 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Acquisitions are often used as a way to engage in corporate venturing. The value of these ventures tends to reside in the knowledge and capabilities of the key management team members who have and maintain key inter-organizational relationships. Because their knowledge and/or relationships may be tacit and therefore difficult to transfer, retaining the key managers in the acquired organization is often a critical issue for the human resource management of the acquiring organization. They are also frequently thought to be critical elements in the future performance in global supply chains and therefore, should be a key concern of human resource management after the acquisition has been culminated. Using a unique dataset of corporate acquisitions in supply-chains, we examine how the development of the psychological contract elements affects retention of critical key global managers. We find that higher retention of the key management team members leads to higher performance after acquisition. We also find that the development of the psychological contract has a positive impact on the retention of key managers with global supply-chain relations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

"Web site interactivity creates numerous opportunities for marketers to persuade online consumers and receives extensive attention in the marketing literature. However, research on cognitive and behavioral responses to web site interactivity is scarce, and more importantly, it does not provide empirical evidence for how interactivity effects can be explained. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the underlying principle that explains the influence of web site. interactivity on consumers' cognitive, affective and behavioral responses: online flow, the web site users' complete immersion in an online activity (Hoffman and Novak 2009). In two studies, the hypothesis was tested that a visitor's flow experience in a specific brand web site mediates the effects of interactivity on the number and type (web site vs. product related) of thoughts, on attitudes toward the brand and web site, and on several behavioral intentions. The results provide evidence for the importance of flow in a marketing context, and the notion that the flow experienced on a specific web site is the underlying mechanism by which cognitive, attitudinal, and behavioral responses to an interactive brand web site can be explained.

"Concepts associated with the resource-based view of the firm are increasingly finding their way into the strategic HRM debate. Drawing on this literature, this paper reports one of the first industry-based, longitudinal investigations into the relationship between human resource strategy and competitive advantage. Set in New Zealand, but in an internationally oriented sector, the study examines one of the more neglected spheres of professional services: engineering consultancies. The results indicate that the consultancy firms that survived the major business traumas of the late 1980s and early 1990s adopted similar structural, competitive, operational and HR responses associated with their evolving 'industry recipe'. In interpreting the relationship between HRM and firm performance, then, it is important to distinguish those features of a firm's HRM which are strategic to ongoing viability from those that might form the basis of a relatively enduring form of competitive advantage. While there is insufficient evidence to conclude that any of the primary subjects in this study have established an enviable form of superiority, the should: suggests that opportunities do exist for professional service firms to develop industry leadership through superior HRM. The analysis has implications for the wider work of theory-building in strategic HRM.","['nan', 'MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'HUMAN ASSETS', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'ORGANIZATION', 'SYSTEMS', 'IMPACT', 'AGENDA', 'VIEW']","['firm performance', 'view']","['based view', 'consultancy', 'firm performance']",0.3333333333333333,0.5
"Borrowing from Rorty (1989:37), this article portrays the entrepreneurial process as a mechanism through which private obsession fulfills public need. It begins with an argument that a deeper understanding of contingency can enhance management scholarship in general and entrepreneurship in particular. It continues with an examination of contingency and entrepreneurial opportunity and then uses six narratives to show how both personal and historical contingencies become resources in the entrepreneurial process. A depiction of possible alternative responses (counterfactuals) for each narrative illustrates how entrepreneurs tend to take a resourceful, rather than an adaptive or a heroic stance toward contingency. A discussion of American Pragmatism provides theoretical support for contingency's role in the entrepreneurial process. The paper concludes with a literature review and a look at how this view of entrepreneurial contingency illuminates the temporal context in management scholarship, among other implications for both research and practice.

"Research summary: The experience of Encyclopaedia Britannica provides the canonical example of the decline of an established firm at the outset of the digital age. Competition from Microsoft's Encarta in 1993 led to sharp declines in the sales of books, which led to the distressed sale of the firm in 1996. This article offers new source material about the actions at both Encarta and Britannica, and it offers a novel interpretation of events. Britannica's management did not misperceive the opportunities and threats, and Britannica did not lack technical prowess. This narrative stresses that Britannica's management faced organizational diseconomies of scope between supporting lines of business in the old and new markets, which generated internal conflicts. These conflicts hindered the commercialization of new technology and hastened its decline.Managerial summary: An established and leading firm, such as Encyclopaedia Britannica, would seem to have enormous advantages over its competitors in a new market. Why would a successful firm come to have severe difficulties organizing for a new market?

"In North America and Western Europe, women now compose almost half the workforce but still face disparities in pay and promotions. We suggest that women's natural experiences of the three Ms (i.e., menstruation, maternity, and menopause) are taboo topics in ways that may constrain women's careers. We propose that the three Ms are particularly incongruent with expectations at intersecting career stages (i.e., a job market newcomer having menstrual discomfort, an early career professional breastfeeding, a company leader getting hot flashes), with implications for work outcomes. In this review, we tackle the taboo of the three Ms by reviewing the evidence for how menstruation, maternity, and menopause are each linked to (1) hormonal and physiological changes, (2) societal beliefs and stereotypes, and (3) work affect, cognition, and behavior. We conclude by proposing novel implications for incorporating the three Ms into existing theoretical frameworks (i.e., work-nonwork spillover; stigma and disclosure; occupational health) and presenting new research questions and practices for understanding and addressing the ways that women's health intersects with career trajectories.","['menstruation', 'pregnancy', 'breastfeeding', 'menopause', ""women's health"", 'work-life', 'diversity', 'stigma', 'careers', 'occupational health', 'EFFORT-REWARD IMBALANCE', 'MENSTRUAL-CYCLE', 'COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE', 'MENOPAUSAL TRANSITION', 'VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS', 'MEMORY COMPLAINTS', 'HORMONAL CHANGES', 'VERBAL MEMORY', 'HUMAN ENERGY', 'HUMAN BRAIN']","['menstruation', 'breastfeeding', 'menopause', 'women s health', 'stigma', 'careers', 'occupational health']","['experiences', 'menstruation maternity', 'menopause', 'breastfeeding']",0.5,0.2857142857142857
"Using a longitudinal dataset of research collaborations over 15 years at Stanford University, we build a theory of intraorganizational task relationships that distinguishes the different factors associated with the formation and persistence of network ties. We highlight six factors: shared organizational foci, shared traits and interests, tie advantages from popularity, tie reinforcement from third parties, tie strength and multiplexity, and the instrumental returns from the products of ties. Findings suggest that ties form when unfamiliar people identify desirable and matching traits in potential partners. By contrast, ties persist when familiar people reflect on the quality of their relationship and shared experiences. The former calls for shallow, short-term strategies for assessing a broad array of potential ties; the latter calls for long-term strategies and substantive assessments of a relationship's worth so as to draw extended rewards from the association. This suggests that organizational activities geared toward sustaining persistent intraorganizational task relationships need to be different from activities aimed at forging new ones.","['research collaborations', 'network ties', 'tie formation', 'tie persistence', 'long-term ties', 'task relationships', 'SOCIAL NETWORKS', 'MULTIPLE NETWORKS', 'SURVIVAL ANALYSIS', 'WEAK TIES', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'DISSOLUTION', 'POWER', 'EMBEDDEDNESS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION']","['research collaborations', 'network ties', 'task relationships']",[],0,0.0

Furthermore, as predicted, the within-person affective forces on OCB were independent of those on CWB-and the two phenomena were themselves independent.

"We examine the conditions under which knowledge embedded in advice relations is likely to reach across intraorganizational boundaries and be shared between distant organizational members. We emphasize boundary-crossing relations because activities of knowledge transfer and sharing across subunit boundaries are systematically related to desirable organizational outcomes. Our main objective is to understand how organizational and social processes interact to sustain the transfer of knowledge carried by advice relations. Using original fieldwork and data that we have collected on members of the top management team in a multiunit industrial group, we show that knowledge embedded in task advice relations is unlikely to crosscut intraorganizational boundaries, unless advice relations are reciprocated, and supported by the presence of hierarchical relations linking managers in different subunits. The results we report are based on a novel Bayesian Exponential Random Graph Models (BERGMs) framework that allows us to test and assess the empirical value of our hypotheses while at the same time accounting for structural characteristics of the intraorganizational network of advice relations.

"A prominent way for firms to manage their moral legitimacy is to invest in sustainability certifications. However, a significant subset of firms remain reluctant to invest in sustainability certifications even decades after the establishment of such certifications. Our paper seeks to elucidate this variance by exploring how firms in the coffee, tea, and chocolate industries legitimise themselves on moral grounds through external communication to stakeholders. Drawing on insights from French Pragmatist Sociology, we suggest that firms primarily rely on two distinct sets of legitimacy principles that reflect their identity orientation: the 'civic and green' world and the 'domestic' world. Specifically, our results show that reliance on the domestic world is negatively related to firms' investment in sustainability certifications. Our findings also suggest that the strength of the relationship between these distinct methods of moral legitimising and certification varies depending on whether firms are characterised by first-or multi-generation family control.","['certifications', 'first-/multi-generation family firms', 'French pragmatist sociology', 'moral legitimacy', 'sustainability', 'ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY ORIENTATION', 'AIDED TEXT ANALYSIS', 'SOCIOEMOTIONAL WEALTH', 'INSTITUTIONAL PRESSURES', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION', 'MANAGING LEGITIMACY', 'FAMILY FIRMS', 'FAIR TRADE', 'COFFEE']","['certifications', 'french pragmatist sociology', 'moral legitimacy', 'sustainability', 'coffee']","['legitimacy', 'sustainability certifications']",0.0,0.0
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate a model of collaboration based on the notion of firms having strong working relationships with their suppliers and customers. Whilst issues associated with collaborative relationships between firms and their trading partners are a key theme currently being addressed in the supply chain management literature, there appears to be a lack of clear guidelines as to how such capability can be developed in a practical sense. Design/methodology/approach - Data from 418 Australian manufacturing plants are used to test the model. Two key constructs, customer relationship and supplier involvement, are developed. For predictive validity purposes, these constructs are regressed against firm performance construct. Findings - Results of structural equation modeling analysis show, inter alia, that there is some support for this collaboration model, with both collaboration-based constructs influencing performance. Originality/value - The results provide an insight into how firms can develop a level of collaboration capability.","['Supply chain management', 'Manufacturing systems', 'Structural design', 'Australia', 'CUTOFF VALUES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INTEGRATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'NETWORKS', 'STRATEGY', 'INSIGHTS', 'TRUST', 'FIT']","['supply chain management', 'australia', 'performance', 'management']","['collaboration', 'supply chain management', 'customer relationship', 'supplier involvement', 'performance']",0.4,0.5
"How do firms balance explorative and exploitative innovation for superior firm performance? While most prior studies have approached this issue by focusing on technology-related innovation, the role of balancing exploration and exploitation in other important organizational domains, i.e., marketing, and the interaction effect of ambidexterity across different domains have been overlooked. This study contributes to this line of research by investigating how firms simultaneously balance exploration and exploitation across two critical domains, namely technology innovation and market innovation. The study distinguishes four types of configurations: market leveraging (technology exploration and market exploitation), technology leveraging (technology exploitation and market exploration), pure exploitation (technology exploitation and market exploitation), and pure exploration (technology exploration and market exploration). From an organizational ambidexterity perspective, the current work investigates whether and how these different combinations exert distinctive effects on firm performance. Specifically, the article posits that (a) technology exploration and market exploitation complement each other, and (b) technology exploitation and market exploration also complement each other, such that both market leveraging and technology leveraging strategies have positive effects on firm performance. The article also maintains that such positive relationships are fully mediated by differentiation and low cost advantages. Conversely, it is argued that (c) technology exploration and market exploration conflict with each other, and (d) so do technology exploitation and market exploitation, such that both pure exploration and pure exploitation have negative effects on firm performance. Hypotheses were tested using survey data collected from 292 manufacturing and service firms in China. The results supported most of the hypotheses, except that pure exploration demonstrated no significant relationship with firm performance.","['technology', 'market', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'differentiation', 'low cost', 'MARKETING CAPABILITIES', 'RADICAL INNOVATION', 'PRODUCT INNOVATION', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EXPLORATION', 'EXPLOITATION', 'CHINA', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'STRATEGY']","['technology', 'market', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'differentiation', 'low cost', 'performance', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'china']","['exploration', 'exploitation']",1.0,0.2
"Using a mixed-methods approach, the current research examines online incivility in relation to service recovery on social media. First, findings from a netnographic investigation suggest consumer-to-consumer (C2C) incivility results in some consumers holding the firm accountable to address uncivil exchanges on a firm-managed communication channel. Based on the netnographic findings, fairness theory, and justice theory, a follow-up experimental study assesses how online incivility negatively affects service recovery outcomes (firm consumer justice) when a firm chooses (not) to respond to the incivility. Through these two studies, the current paper proposes a new form of justice (C2C interactional justice) and posits that online service recovery extends beyond direct victims of the incivility (first-party justice) to also include observers (third-party justice). This more nuanced view of justice associated with a service recovery is especially significant when considering the traditional relationships of justice with satisfaction, loyalty, positive word-of-mouth, and other desirable firm outcomes. For practitioners, this research suggests that firms must manage C2C interactional justice on corporate social media channels for both complainants and observers to avoid reputational damage and a loss of customers.

Data from eBay auctions and the lab show that a red (vs. blue) background elicits higher bid jumps. By contrast, red (vs. blue) backgrounds decrease price offers in negotiations. An investigation of the underlying process reveals that red color induces aggression through arousal. In addition, the selling mechanism-auction or negotiation-alters the effect of color by focusing individuals on primarily competing against other bidders (in auctions) or against the seller (in negotiations). Specifically, aggression is higher with red (vs. blue or gray) color and, therefore, increases bid jumps in auctions but decreases offers in negotiations.","['nan', 'TRAIT HOSTILITY', 'AGGRESSION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'WIDOWBIRDS', 'STRATEGIES', 'CULTURES', 'MODEL', 'WEB']",['aggression'],['willingness to pay'],0.0,0.0
"How important is the physical location of a new firm for its chances of survival? Location of a new firm, whether in urban, metro, or rural vicinities, can have important impacts on performance outcomes. Urban locations often contain a wealth of diverse resources but may also have a greater number of competitors. Rural locations may lack diversity but can enable the firm to exploit a niche with limited competition. We suggest that a simple examination of new firm location will not adequately predict survival chances. Rather the impact on location of the new firm will be influenced by the industry in which the new firm operates and by the strategy the new firm pursues. The industry of the new firm is examined by focusing on where the new firm is located in the value chain. We predict that a new firm upstream in the industry value chain will have better chances of survival than new firms downdstream in the industry value chain. New firms with broadly focused strategies are hypothesized to have greater survival chances than new firms strategically positioned to exploit a narrow market focus. And we predict that new firms in urban locations will have greater chances for survival than new firms in rural locations. We propose in this research that survival chances of new firms are best understood by examining interaction effects between location, industry, and strategy. To accomplish this examination, we develop a model for testing two-way interactions between industry-strategy, location-strategy, and industry-location. Finally, we include a three-way interaction where new firms are tested for survival outcomes based on the combination of location, strategy, and industry. The findings of this study, based on a large representative sample of over 1900 new firms, suggest that new firm survival chances are not significantly impacted when industry was examined separately. The findings do indicate that survival chances are associated with strategy and location and by the two-way interactions of industry by strategy. Although the three-way interaction test of industry, strategy, and location did not indicate statistical significance, there are specific instances where survival chances of the new firm appear to be modified by industry and location.","['nan', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'ENTRY']",['performance'],['location'],0.0,0.0
"In the information age, the firm's performance hinges on combining partners' specialist knowledge to achieve value co-creation. Combining knowledge from different specialties could be a costly process in the international technology alliances (ITAs) context. We argue that the combination of different specializations requires the development of trans-specialization understanding (TSU) instead of the internalization of partners' specialist knowledge. This article examines the extent to which inter-firm governance in ITAs shapes TSU, and whether the development of TSU is endangered by cultural distance. We hypothesize that relational governance, product modularity, and cultural distance influence TSU development, which in turn influences firm performance. We collected data from 110 non-equity ITAs between software and hardware firms participating in the mobile device sector. We analyzed the data using partial least squares path modeling. Our findings suggest that TSU largely depends on product modularity and relational governance in alliances. However, while cultural distance negatively moderates the path from relational governance to TSU, it has no effect on the relationship between product modularity and TSU. Based on this, we conclude that product modularity can substitute for relational governance when strong relational norms are not well-developed in international alliances. Thus cultural distance does not invariably amount to a liability in ITAs.","['international technology alliance', 'trans-specialization understanding', 'cultural distance', 'product modularity', 'relational governance', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH', 'PRODUCT INNOVATION', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL THEORY', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'EVOLUTIONARY-THEORY', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'SHARED KNOWLEDGE', 'JOINT VENTURES']","['international technology alliance', 'trans specialization understanding', 'cultural distance', 'product modularity', 'relational governance']","['performance', 'international technology alliances', 'inter firm governance', 'cultural distance']",0.25,0.2

"While accessing information online, consumers exhibit differences in their patterns of search, that is, time spent per search episode and search frequency. The search patterns vary across both consumer characteristics and product categories. We empirically investigate consumer online information search termination patterns, and relate the differences to product categories and consumer characteristics. Findings of such an empirical study would be useful for planning communication strategies, website design, etc. The model is calibrated on empirical data collected through online surveys. We find that consumer learning occurs when consumers search across search goods, but not when they search across experience goods. (C) 2004 by New York University. Published by Elsevier.

"Managers increasingly realize the importance of involving the sales force in new product development. However, despite recent progress, research on the specific role of the sales force in product innovation-related activities remains scarce. In particular, the importance of a salespersons' internal knowledge brokering has been neglected. This study develops and empirically validates the concept of internal knowledge brokering behavior and its effect on selling new products and developing new business, and explores whether a salesperson's internal brokering qualities are determined by biological traits. The findings reveal that salespeople with the DRD2A1 gene variant engage at significant lower levels of internal knowledge-brokering behavior than salespeople without this gene variant, and as a result are less likely to engage effectively in new product selling. The DRD4 gene variant had no effect on internal knowledge brokering.

"In this study, we extend the expert information processing theory approach to entrepreneurial cognition research through an empirical exploration of the new transaction commitment mindset among business people in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Using analysis of covariance, multivariate analysis of variance, and hierarchical regression analysis of data from a cross-sectional sample of 417 respondents, our results provide a foundation for additional cross-level theory development, with related implications for increasing the practicality of expert information processing theory-based entrepreneurial cognition research. Specifically, this paper: (1) clarifies the nature of the relationship between entrepreneurial expert scripts and constructs that might represent an entrepreneurial mindset at the individual level of analysis; (2) identifies analogous relationships at the economy level of analysis, where the structure found at the individual level informs an economy-level problem; (3) presents a North American Free Trade Agreement-based illustration analysis to demonstrate the extent to which cognitive findings at the individual level can be used to explain economy-level phenomena; and (4) extrapolates from our analysis some of the ways in which script-based comparisons across country or culture can inform the more general task of making information processing-based comparisons among entrepreneurs across other contexts.","['nan', 'VALUE CREATION', 'VALUE CAPTURE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'EXPRESSION', 'CHALLENGES', 'EXPERIENCE', 'CONSTRUCT', 'DECISION', 'SINKING']",['construct'],[],0,0.0
"Across many different contexts, individuals consult customer ratings to inform their purchase decisions. The present studies document a novel phenomenon, dubbed the binary bias, which plays an important role in how individuals evaluate customer reviews. Our main proposal is that people tend to make a categorical distinction between positive ratings (e.g., 4s and 5s) and negative ratings (e.g., 1s and 2s). However, within those bins, people do not sufficiently distinguish between more extreme values (5s and 1s) and less extreme values (4s and 2s). As a result, people's subjective representations of distributions are heavily impacted by the extent to which those distributions are imbalanced (having more 4s and 5s vs. more 1s and 2s). Ten studies demonstrate that this effect has important consequences for people's product evaluations and purchase decisions. Additionally, we show this effect is not driven by the salience of particular bars, unrealistic distributions, certain statistical properties of a distribution, or diminishing subjective utility. Furthermore, we demonstrate this phenomenon's relevance to other domains besides product reviews, and discuss the implications for existing research on how people integrate conflicting evidence.","['online user ratings', 'information integration', 'binary thinking', 'CATEGORIZATION', 'THINKING', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PREFERENCE', 'REVIEWS', 'CUES']",['reviews'],['bias'],0.0,0.0
"In this paper we theorize about illicit roles and explore their effects on resilient team performance. We define an illicit role as one whose occupants specialize in activity forbidden by the law, regulatory bodies, or professional societies, in the belief that doing so provides a competitive advantage. Using longitudinal data on professional hockey teams, we examine the enforcer-a player who specializes in the prohibited activity of fighting. We find that team performance is more disrupted by the injury of an enforcer than by the injury of occupants of other formal roles on the team. In addition, team performance recovers more slowly after this setback to the extent the team tries to replace an enforcer, and the performance disruptions associated with his exit are magnified as a function of his experience with his team. We use these findings to develop new theory about organizational roles that operate outside official channels and formal structures. We suggest that such role occupants are more difficult to replace than their formal counterparts, in part because to enact these roles effectively requires experience in the local social context.","['nan', 'STRATEGIC CORE', 'FAMILIARITY', 'COORDINATION', 'TASK', 'EXPERIENCE', 'WORK', 'COSMOPOLITANS', 'ADAPTATION', 'SUCCESSION', 'LEADERSHIP']",['experience'],['hockey'],0.0,0.0
"Using qualitative and quantitative methods, I draw on the categorization and stigmatization literatures to predict the amount of negative social evaluations-that is, disapproval-received by firms. Association with a stigmatized category does not automatically result in disapproval, because straddling multiple categories dilutes stakeholder attention to the stigma. In addition, category saliency moderates the effect of category straddling on disapproval. Findings from the global arms industry highlight how managers can modify categorical associations at the industry and customer levels to decrease disapproval, and I discuss implications for diversification and internationalization strategies. Results also highlight how an exogenous shock (the 9/11 terrorist attacks) modified the saliency of the categories used by arms industry stakeholders. Finally, this study shows that category straddling results in more neutral social evaluations for firms, making positive evaluations less positive, and negative ones less negative.","['nan', 'SECURITIES ANALYSTS', 'LEGITIMACY', 'CORPORATE', 'IMPACT', 'MARKET', 'PERSISTENCE', 'STRATEGY', 'PRODUCT', 'FIRMS', 'CONSTRUCTION']",['firms'],"['categorization', 'stigmatization', 'social evaluations', 'arms industry', 'diversification']",0.0,0.0
"Research summary: The use of Heckman models by strategy scholars to resolve sample selection bias has increased by more than 700 percent over the last decade, yet significant inconsistencies exist in how they have applied and interpreted these models. In view of these differences, we explore the drivers of sample selection bias and review how Heckman models alleviate it. We demonstrate three important findings for scholars seeking to use Heckman models: First, the independent variable of interest must be a significant predictor in the first stage of a model for sample selection bias to exist. Second, the significance of lambda alone does not indicate sample selection bias. Finally, Heckman models account for sample-induced endogeneity, but are not effective when other sources of endogeneity are present.Managerial summary: When nonrandom samples are used to test statistical relationships, sample selection bias can lead researchers to flawed conclusions that can, in turn, negatively impact managerial decision-making. We examine the use of Heckman models, which were designed to resolve sample selection bias, in strategic management research and highlight conditions when sample selection bias is present as well as when it is not. We also distinguish sample selection bias, a form of omitted variable (OV) bias, from more traditional OV bias, emphasizing that it is possible for models to have sample selection bias, traditional OV bias, or both. Accurately identifying the type(s) of OV bias present is essential to effectively correcting it. We close with several recommendations to improve practice surrounding the use of Heckman models.

"Existing theoretical models of team innovation emphasize internal team processes and external conditions that facilitate or hinder innovation, but these models tend to be more suited for incremental than for radical innovation. Teams developing radical innovations face greater uncertainty and risk of failure and often encounter unanticipated challenges that require the concerted efforts of the team as a whole to move the project forward rather than face termination. Drawing on state goal orientation theory, we analyze the motivational drivers that position teams to effectively deal with such challenges. We propose a novel approach for managing team motivational states that involves adapting team goal, preferences at key points in the innovation process in order to achieve radical innovation success. We advance a model highlighting teams' ability to dynamically shift shared goal orientations to meet acute shocks that disrupt regular team activities and threaten the survival of the innovation project. We identify the roles of ambidextrous leadership and reflexive team processes in achieving goal orientation shifts as important factors in radical innovation success. Although unanticipated challenges related to idea development and idea promotion may occur in both radical and incremental innovation projects, we argue that the effects are stronger the more radical the innovation.","['nan', 'FEEDBACK-SEEKING PROCESS', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'DISCONTINUOUS INNOVATION', 'MANAGEMENT TEAMS', 'WORK GROUPS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LEADERSHIP', 'ACHIEVEMENT', 'BEHAVIOR', 'ORGANIZATION']",['leadership'],"['goal', 'leadership']",0.5,1.0

"As emphasized by Barney (1986), any explanation of superior profitability must account for why the resources supporting such profitability could have been acquired for a price below their rent-generating capacity. Building upon the literature in economics on coordination failures and incomplete markets, we suggest a framework for analyzing such strategic factor market inefficiencies. Our point of departure is that a strategic opportunity exists whenever prices fail to reflect the value of a resource's best use. This paper examines the challenges of imputing a resource's value in the absence of explicit price guidance and suggests the likely characteristics of strategic opportunities. Our framework also suggests that the discovery of strategic opportunity is often a matter a 'serendipity' and access to relevant idiosyncratic resources. This latter observation provides prescriptive advice, although the analysis also explains why more detailed guidance has to be firm specific.

"Do the effects of attitude toward the ad on consumer decisions endure beyond the scenarios that characterize previous research? in examining this question, we focus on the persistence of ad-attitude effects as a function of the level of attention at encoding and the delay between ad exposure and response. The results of an experiment designed to test our hypotheses suggest that ad-attitude effects do not persist in a number of instances. Over time, as memory for an ad fades, its effects on ad attitude dissipate. As a result, the ad-attitude effects on brand attitude that are reported in past research disappear after a delay. In fact, in certain situations likable ads are shown to have a detrimental impact on brand attitude. For instance, when it receives little attention, a highly affective ad (compared with a more neutral ad) may focus attention away from the brand claims and lead to a lower brand attitude after a delay.","['nan', 'MEMORY', 'MEDIATOR']",['memory'],"['attention', 'memory']",0.5,1.0
"In this paper, we examine how employee mobility impacts the human capital of both those who are new to the organization (movers) and those who are existing members (incumbents). Employee mobility events can disrupt both the location-specific and the colleague-specific components of human capital and thus have different impacts on overall human capital. We test our theory on the disparate effects of location change and personnel change on human capital in the highly interdependent context of the National Basketball Association. We find that movers experience adverse performance shocks after mobility events that are moderated when moving as a group, and we also find that group mobility events hinder the performance improvement of incumbents. Our findings are consistent with the limited transfer of location-specific human capital and the disruption of colleague-specific human capital after mobility events.","['knowledge transfer/replication', 'strategic HRM', 'groups/group processes/dynamics', 'teams', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'EMPLOYEE MOBILITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'EXPERIENCE', 'RESOURCE', 'FIRMS', 'JOB', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'METAANALYSIS']","['employee mobility', 'performance', 'experience']","['employee mobility', 'human capital', 'location change', 'personnel', 'performance']",0.4,0.6666666666666666
"As offline retailers struggle to compete with online ones, the importance of a consumer's ability to touch a product prior to purchase becomes important to study. Prior research has found inconsistent results on whether product touch facilitates consumers' product-related decision making. Some studies report a positive effect, whereas others do not. The current research reconciles this inconsistency and draws retailing implications. Across three experiments, we show that the effect of product touch on consumers' purchase intentions and willingness to pay for a product being evaluated is evident when consumers' mental representation of the product is concrete, but not when abstract. We further show that perceived risk and perceived ownership simultaneously mediate this moderating effect of mental representation. Implications are drawn for both offline and online retailers.

"Corporate governance (CG) research has typically been studied from rather disparate disciplinary approaches, thereby offering myopic and often conflicting rationales. We develop an institutional configurational approach to integrate this siloed' field and explain CG patterns around the world. To do so, we draw on an inductive, theory-building methodology based on fuzzy-set logic to uncover the configurations across institutional actor-centred domains and their impact on CG patterns. Empirically, we explore the necessary and sufficient causal conditions leading to different features of codes of good governance across 32 OECD countries. We generate propositions linking configurational institutional domains to code features. Our results show that a single institutional domain by itself is not sufficient to explain CG outcomes, and that these domains need to be considered in conjunction, leading, in turn, to the identification of four distinct configurational governance prototypes. Our study offers a comprehensive account of drivers of cross-national differences in CG and yields useful insights for managing and regulating governance.","['codes', 'corporate governance', 'institutional configuration', 'qualitative comparative analysis', 'CODES', 'LAW', 'OWNERSHIP', 'WORLDWIDE', 'FRENCH', 'MARKET', 'STATE']","['codes', 'corporate governance', 'institutional configuration', 'codes']","['corporate governance', 'theory building', 'fuzzy set logic', 'codes']",0.5,0.5
"How does the scientific value of innovations vary with the maturity of the knowledge that underlies them? We reconcile conflicting views in the innovation literature by introducing a contingency perspective that underscores the role of knowledge distance along technological and geographical domains. We predict an inverted U-shaped effect of knowledge maturity on the scientific value of new innovations. We further suggest that incorporating geographically distant knowledge can enhance the value contribution of knowledge maturity, whereas incorporating technologically distant knowledge or waiting for the adoption of knowledge in the industry mitigates this value. Our analysis of 5,575 biotechnology patented innovations offers support for our conjectures. We thus advance research on knowledge management and innovation by underscoring the temporal aspect of innovation and its interplay with technological and geographical distances.","['innovation', 'knowledge maturity', 'technological distance', 'geographical distance', 'knowledge adoption', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'LOCAL SEARCH', 'PATENT STRATEGY', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'OLD TECHNOLOGY', 'EXPLORATION', 'FIRM', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EXPLOITATION']","['innovation', 'knowledge maturity', 'geographical distance']",['biotechnology'],0.0,0.0
"This article is for venture capitalists (VCs) and managers belonging to a new venture ream (NVT) who are interested in understanding factors that lead to NVT dismissal. Because dismissals can be a costly and ineffective way to improve venture performance, it is in a VCs interest to know when to avoid funding ventures that are likely to be impacted by dismissals. However, from an NVT perspective if is also essential that they avoid making costly mistakes that could lend to their dismissal. If NVTs could recognize signals that their actions were viewed as being detrimental to the venture, this recognition could enable them to take corrective actions and avoid being dismissed. Most importantly, if we understood the factors that were driving NVT dismissals, we could begin to evaluate how dismissals might be used to create long-term value for a venture's backers. Contractual covenants limiting salaries paid to venture managers were found to be related to fewer dismissals, which supports the view that clearly signaling the consequences of underperformance may motivate managers to perform better. We may also infer that contractual covenants can effectively align an NVTs financial incentives with those of the VC and the venture's board of directors. However dismissal covenants that force a change in the new venture team were an ineffective means of preventing dismissal. It may be that individual managers can only imagine dismissal covenants being rued against other team members and not against themselves. Or it is possible that the use of explicit contractual covenants to signal the adverse conservancies of underperformance may not eliminate dismissals if the signals are misunderstood or disbelieved. Moreover, these signals could be costly investments with uncertain returns. Practically speaking, we learn that specifying the conditions that will lend to a change in management is an ineffective mechanism for aligning the VCs interests with those of the NVT. This study found a negative relationship between sales improvement per employee since first-round finding and dismissal. This result is consistent with studies of large firms-dismissal occurs when firms perform poorly. Increasing the total number of seats on a venture's board of directors was negatively related to NVT dismissals; however, the effect reversed itself when the antecedent was the number of VC appointees on the board. This result mises the question of when VC appointees should borrow authority from their positions on the board to sanction (or even push for) a dismissal and when they should cooperate with other board members in being patient with an NVTs performance, even though as insiders they could band together to force a change in management Before co,committing itself to fund a deal, a VC ought to consider how the structure of the board of directors will limit its power to affect changes in the composition of the management team. The larger the board the more difficult it will be to make changes unless VC appointees occupy most of the sears. This study also found a negative relationship between procedural justice in the VC-NVT relationship and NVT dismissal There is apparently a need to demonstrate that NVT dismissals are carried out fairly and are in the best interests of the venture, the NVT survivors, and the VC. Otherwise, survivors could be less enthusiastic about any success the venture might enjoy, because they might fear that they would not be employed long enough to enjoy it.

However, many articles that report consumer behavior experiments contain one or more results that are significantly insignificant. That is, one or more experimental results are so unusually weak or minuscule that they are unlikely to have come about by chance. As such, significantly insignificant results can be due to the failure of the theory underlying an experiment and/or the flawed design or implementation of an experiment.

"We investigate trust relationships between senior business executives and their overseas partners. Drawing on the similarity-attraction paradigm, social categorization theory, and the distinction between cognition- and affect-based trust, we argue that executives trust their overseas partners differently, depending on the partners' cultural ethnicity. In a field survey of 108 Chinese senior executives, we found that these executives have higher affect-based trust in overseas partners of the same cultural ethnicity as themselves; cognition-based trust is associated with affect-based trust differently when overseas partners are of the same or different cultural ethnicity. We also examine the role of relative firm size and age in shaping intra-and intercultural trust. Relative firm size has a stronger negative effect on executives' cognition-based trust if their partners are of a different cultural ethnicity. Although firm age does not have a negative effect on executives' affect-based trust as hypothesized, we found firm age to be positively associated with affect-based trust for partners of the same cultural ethnicity. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of this pattern of inter-and intra-cultural trust on international business and networking (guanxi) dynamics in China.

"We examine investor stereotypes and implicit bias in crowdfunding decisions. Prior research in formal venture capital settings demonstrates that investors tend to have a funding bias against women. However, in crowdfunding - wherein a 'crowd' of amateur investors make relatively small investments in new companies - our empirical observations reveal a funding advantage for women. We explain the causal mechanism underlying this counterintuitive finding by drawing upon stereotype content theory and testing a dual path moderated-mediation model. Based on archival data and a follow-up experiment, our findings suggest common gender biases held by amateur investors function to increase female stereotype perceptions in the form of trustworthiness judgments, which subsequently increases investors' willingness to invest in early-stage women-led ventures.

"The authors derive an expression for the price elasticity of demand in the presence of reference price effects that includes a component resulting from the presence of gains and losses in consumer evaluations. The effect of reference price is most noticeable immediately after a price change, before consumers have had time to adjust their reference price. As a result, immediate-term price elasticity is higher than long-term elasticity, which describes the response of demand long after a price change, when reference price effects are negligible. Furthermore, because of the differential effect of gains and losses, immediate-term price elasticity for price increases and price decreases is not equal. The authors provide a quantitative definition for the terms immediate term and long term, using the average interpurchase time and the discrete memory parameter. Practical consequences of the distinction between immediate- and long-term elasticities for the estimation and use of elasticity values are discussed.","['reference price', 'price elasticity', 'immediate term', 'promotional elasticity', 'BRAND CHOICE', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'MODELS', 'IMPACT', 'PROMOTIONS', 'SALES']","['reference price', 'price elasticity', 'immediate term']",[],0,0.0
"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate how the use of information technology (IT) and supply chain management initiatives (information sharing and collaboration) impact a company's performance in reverse logistics (RL). Design/methodology/approach - A survey based on a previous exploratory research and literature review was sent out to 600 US companies having substantial activities in RL. Issues addressed in the survey, such as IT types deployed, IT operational attributes, information sharing, and collaboration, involve multiple parties in multi-tier RL networks, extending beyond a simple buyer-supplier dyad. Findings - The results revealed that the type of IT used per se did not have a differential impact on a company's performance in RL. However, IT operational attributes positively affected RL performance and information sharing and collaboration are critical to RL performance. Practical implications - Investment in IT alone cannot improve a company's performance; managers should take full account of IT attributes when deciding IT in RL. IT operational attributes tend to support one another - an improvement in one would lead to improvements in the others. With no exception in RL, companies need to share information and collaborate with their partners.

"We examine how managerial growth logics combine with financial and human resource slack to influence the short-term revenue growth of a sample of 112 manufacturing firms drawn from a unique database provided by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. Our results provide evidence that firms pursuing product expansion logics generally grow more slowly than firms that are not expanding their product base, but that financial slack positively moderates this relationship. We also find that human resource slack enhances short-term market expansion, but slows down short-term product expansion.

"While strategic alliances have emerged in recent years as common and important structural vehicles for business development, surprisingly little is known about how collaborative activities are organized and administered within these governance structures. We see classic organizational scholarship as useful insofar as it both provides clear classifications that distinguish alternative intraorganizational designs and explicates how they affect the inner workings of organizations. Existing alliance classification schemes based on type of collaborative activity, partner characteristics, or legal structure, on the other hand, rarely delineate important differences of how collaborative work is organized among partners. We seek to redress this shortcoming by developing a framework of alliance structural parameters based on classic organizational design considerations. Specifically we identify and discuss five key design parameters for alliances: the structural interface between partners, the structural intraface within partners, and the specialization, formalization, and centralization of the alliance organization. We show how consideration of these five parameters provides a deeper understanding of alliance governance and suggest how partner organizations can achieve differential levels of connectivity and steering for their collaborative ventures.","['structure', 'design and boundaries', 'cooperative strategy', 'strategic alliances', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'TRANSACTION COST', 'CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK', 'INTERFIRM NETWORKS', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'COORDINATION']","['structure', 'strategic alliances']","['strategic alliances', 'ventures']",0.5,0.5
"Marketing implications of technological innovation have received considerable attention in the recent past. In this article, Mohan Reddy, John Aram, and Leonard Lynn suggest that the institutional scope for understanding technology diffusion, in addition to supplier and user organizations and industries, should include organizations that manufacture technological complementarities, institutions that possess vertical complementary assets, and the nonmarket sector. The nonmarket sector includes trade associations, professional societies, governmental agencies, independent research agencies, and public service organizations.

"What is the interrelationship among formal institutions, social networks, and new venture growth? Drawing on the theory of institutional polycentrism and social network theory, we examine this question using data on 637 entrepreneurs from four different countries. We find the confluence of weak and inefficient formal institutions to be associated with a larger number of structural holes in entrepreneurial social networks. While the effect of this institutional order on the revenue growth of new ventures is negative, a network's structural holes have a positive effect on revenue growth. Furthermore, the positive effect of structural holes on revenue growth is stronger in an environment with a more adverse institutional order (i.e., weaker and more inefficient institutions). The contributions and implications of these findings are discussed.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSES', 'STRUCTURAL HOLES', 'CHINA', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MARKETS', 'CONNECTIONS', 'DYNAMICS', 'ECONOMY', 'GUANXI', 'RUSSIA']",['structural holes'],"['formal institutions social networks', 'new venture growth', 'formal institutions', 'structural holes']",0.25,1.0

Focusing on the executive search industry, the authors found that executive search firm representatives are more likely to contact White males than females and minority males, that the compensation advantage resulting from an external labor market strategy is strongest among White male managers and executives, and that search firm-initiated contacts moderate the relationship between compensation and mobility in an external labor market.

"Most gift-giving research focuses on how aspects of the giver, recipient, or their relationship impact gift exchange. This longitudinal study of the Christmas giving of five informants demonstrates that givers strategically incorporate, or allow themselves to be influenced by, third parties when selecting gifts for recipients. Moreover, givers' motivations for incorporating these influences can change over time. Thus, seemingly personal gifts to recipients actually reflect givers' relationships with others in the social network. Our taxonomy of 10 social influences on givers' behavior, as well as givers' motivations and the relational processes associated with each, broadens the scope of current gift-giving research and begins exploring how social relationships impact gift exchange.","['nan', 'GIFT']",['gift'],[],0,0.0
"Using an ecological lens, we extend strategic management and industrial organization theory to investigate the performance effects of horizontal mergers. We theorize that firms differ in their ability to benefit from horizontal mergers; that the products involved in the merger differ in their ability to attain and sustain any increase in performance above their premerger level; and that resource niches in which each product competes differ in terms of competitive constraints. We then test these predictions using longitudinal data specified at the product market level, a unit of analysis that is less influenced by aggregation bins than are industry, firm, and even line-of-business level data. Our findings demonstrate how organizational ecology, when coupled with strategic management and industrial organization economic theories, can enrich our understanding of horizontal mergers.

"Prior research has acknowledged the importance of an organization's absorptive capacitythe ability to acquire new knowledge and information, assimilate, transform, and exploit itfor innovation purposes. Because innovations are usually developed by project teams, this suggests that absorptive capacity, as a construct, may also be usefully applied at the team level. Consequently, this study developed a measure for team-level absorptive capacity, investigated the potential influencing factors, and examined its relationship to team effectiveness in terms of product innovativeness in an interorganizational context. Specifically, building on the theory of homophily and information and decision-making theories, three factors (social-category similarity, work-style similarity, and knowledge complementarity between the recipient and the partner organization teams) were identified as likely antecedents of team absorptive capacity. The hypotheses were tested on data from 98 interorganizational new product development teams and included responses from team members, team leaders, and team-external managers. With regard to the antecedents of team absorptive capacity in interorganizational settings, the results showed a significant positive association with partners' work-style similarity and an inverted U-shaped relationship with partners' knowledge complementarity. Social-category similarity was not significantly associated with team absorptive capacity. We also examined whether team absorptive capacity was related to interorganizational team effectiveness and found a significant positive relationship between team absorptive capacity and product innovativeness. The study demonstrates that absorptive is indeed related to team effectiveness outcomes in an interorganizational context, which underlines the importance of team-level absorptive capacity for product innovation management and suggests paying more attention to the lower levels of absorptive capacity.","['nan', 'KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION', 'SUPPLIER INVOLVEMENT', 'PROJECT TEAMS', 'DIVERSITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'INTEGRATION', 'WORK', 'SIMILARITY', 'MANAGEMENT']","['project teams', 'innovation', 'work', 'similarity', 'management']",[],0,0.0
"Some studies have assumed close proximity to improve team communication on the premise that reduced physical distance increases the chance of contact and information exchange. However, research showed that the relationship between team proximity and team communication is not always straightforward and may depend on some contextual conditions. Hence, this study was designed with the purpose of examining how a contextual condition like time pressure may influence the relationship between team proximity and team communication. In this study, time pressure was conceptualized as a two-dimensional construct: challenge time pressure and hindrance time pressure, such that each has different moderating effects on the proximitycommunication relationship. The research was conducted with 81 new product development (NPD) teams (437 respondents) in Western Europe (Belgium, England, France, Germany, and the Netherlands). These teams functioned in short-cycled industries and developed innovative products for the consumer, electronic, semiconductor, and medical sectors. The unit of analysis was a team, which could be from a single-team or a multiteam project. Results showed that challenge time pressure moderates the relationship between team proximity and team communication such that this relationship improves for teams that experience high rather than low challenge time pressure. Hindrance time pressure moderates the relationship between team proximity and team communication such that this relationship improves for teams that experience low rather than high hindrance time pressure. Our findings contribute to theory in two ways. First, this study showed that challenge and hindrance time pressure differently influences the benefits of team proximity toward team communication in a particular work context. We found that teams under high hindrance time pressure do not benefit from close proximity, given the natural tendency for premature cognitive closure and the use of avoidance coping tactics when problems surface. Thus, simply reducing physical distances is unlikely to promote communication if motivational or human factors are neglected. Second, this study demonstrates the strength of the challenge-hindrance stressor framework in advancing theory and explaining inconsistencies. Past studies determined time pressure by considering only its levels without distinguishing the type of time pressure. We suggest that this study might not have been able to uncover the moderating effects of time pressure if we had conceptualized time pressure in the conventional way.","['nan', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'PROJECT GROUPS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STRESS', 'CONFLICT', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'CHALLENGE', 'ATTENTION', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['product development', 'stress', 'challenge']",['time pressure'],0.0,0.0
"A large number of family firms employ nonfamily managers. This article analyzes the optimal compensation contracts of nonfamily managers employed by family firms using principal-agent analysis. The model shows that the contracts should have low incentive levels in terms of short-term performance measures. This finding is moderated by nonfamily managers' responsiveness to incentives, their level of risk aversion, and measurement errors of effort related to short-term performance. The model allows a comparison between the contracts of family and nonfamily managers. This comparison shows that the contracts of family managers should include relatively greater incentives in terms of short-term performance measures. A number of propositions regarding the compensation of nonfamily managers employed by family firms are formulated.

"The paper examines the opportunities in and possibilities arising from big data in retailing, particularly along five major data dimensions data pertaining to customers, products, time,(geo-spatial) location and channel. Much of the increase in data quality and application possibilities comes from a mix of new data sources, a smart application of statistical tools and domain knowledge combined with theoretical insights. The importance of theory in guiding any systematic search for answers to retailing questions, as well as for streamlining analysis remains undiminished, even as the role of big data and predictive analytics in retailing is set to rise in importance, aided by newer sources of data and large-scale correlational techniques. The Statistical issues discussed include a particular focus on the relevance and uses of Bayesian analysis techniques (data borrowing, updating, augmentation and hierarchical modeling), predictive analytics using big data and a field experiment, all in a retailing context. Finally, the ethical and privacy issues that may arise from the use of big data in retailing are also highlighted. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"This article investigates the impact of service transition (the infusion of services in addition to goods to a manufacturing firm's offering) on firm-idiosyncratic risk. The authors analyze a unique data set of 168 publicly traded manufacturing firms over a 6-year financial window (2006-2011), with the results showing that service transition produces a substantial increase in idiosyncratic risk. This effect, however, varies depending on critical firm contexts. First, strategic coherence (research and development intensity and service relatedness) mitigates market misgivings and causes idiosyncratic risk to decrease as service becomes more central to the offering. Second, misappropriation of resources (marketing expenses and resource slack) exacerbates the impact, resulting in increased firm risk. In light of the findings, the authors were able to expand the primary theoretical underpinnings concerning service transition by (1) providing a more holistic framework to view the phenomenon (behavioral theory of the firm), (2) demonstrating contextual boundaries around service transition, and (3) providing managers with useful insights to inform strategic firm-level decisions.","['idiosyncratic risk', 'service transition', 'commoditization', 'behavioral theory of the firm', 'service infusion', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'BEHAVIORAL-THEORY', 'STOCK RETURNS', 'CROSS-SECTION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'RESOURCES', 'SUCCESS', 'IMPACT', 'ACQUISITION']","['idiosyncratic risk', 'service transition', 'behavioral theory of the firm', 'research and development', 'behavioral theory', 'resources', 'impact']","['service transition', 'idiosyncratic risk', 'strategic coherence research and development', 'misappropriation', 'slack', 'phenomenon behavioral theory']",0.3333333333333333,0.2857142857142857
"Although research relating to paradox has burgeoned throughout the past decades, how paradox has been used in generating theoretical contributions remains largely tacit. Hinging on the systematic analysis of 476 publications, this literature review uncovers how scholars have leveraged paradox in demarcating theoretical contributions in the area of management and organization research. First, scholars can make use of paradox as a means to theorize, adding to the core conceptual conversation on paradox. Second, scholars can make use of paradox as a means to understand or advance insight on particular phenomena, drawing from paradox's conceptual knowledge to push forth discussions or debates in other strands of the management and organization field. Finally, scholars can make use of paradox as a way to verbalize something puzzling or surprising, supporting how readers are to appreciate or make sense of theoretical contributions advanced. Denoting approaches identified as highly complementary, this paper offers explicit handholds for academics to develop theoretical contributions through paradox, supporting the consolidation and further elevation of scholarly impact for the paradox community as such.","['nan', 'MANAGERIAL SENSEMAKING', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'BUILDING THEORY', 'INNOVATION', 'STRATEGY', 'TENSIONS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'BUSINESS', 'EDITORS', 'IMPACT']","['knowledge', 'impact']",[],0,0.0
"Private benefits of control (PBC) are benefits that controlling shareholders consume, but that are not shared with minority shareholders. Research focusing on the value protection role of corporate governance typically frames PBC as principal-principal (PP) agency costs, and interprets them as a form of minority shareholder expropriation that decreases firm performance. Taking a value creation perspective of corporate governance, however, we propose a more nuanced role for PBC. Specifically, we see them also as PP agency benefits that compensate controlling shareholders for their monitoring and advisory services, which can increase firm performance. Since both PP costs and benefits affect firm performance, we theorize that PBC enhance firm performance at a diminishing rate. Furthermore, we show that the effect of PBC on firm performance is more positive when country-level external governance mechanisms are strong.","['control transactions', 'comparative corporate governance', 'controlling shareholders', 'institutions', 'firm performance', 'private benefits of control', 'CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'AGENCY COSTS', 'SHAREHOLDER COALITIONS', 'MANAGEMENT RESEARCH', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'MULTILEVEL MODELS', 'CEO DUALITY', 'ENTRENCHMENT', 'INSTITUTIONS']","['controlling shareholders', 'firm performance', 'private benefits of control', 'corporate governance', 'agency costs']","['value protection', 'corporate governance', 'agency costs', 'firm performance']",0.75,0.6

"The customer or user's role in the new product development process is limited or nonexistent in many high technology firms, despite evidence that suggests customers are frequently an excellent source for new product ideas with great market potential. This article examines the implementation of the Lead User method for gathering new product ideas from leading edge customers by an IT firm that had not previously done much customer research during their new product development efforts. This case study follows the decision-makers of the firm through the process. where the end result is the generation of a number of useful product concepts. Besides the ideas generated, management at the firm is also impressed with the way the method makes their new product development process more cross-functional and they plan to make it a part of their future new product development practices. Approximately one year later the firm is revisited to find out if the Lead User method has become a permanent part of their new product development process. The authors find, however, that the firm has abandoned research on the customer despite the fact that several of the lead-user derived product concepts had been successfully implemented. Management explanations for their return to a technology push process for developing new products include personnel turnover and lack of time. Using organizational learning theory to examine the case. the authors suggest that the nontechnology specific product concepts generated by the lead users were seen as ambiguous and hence overly simplistic and less valuable by the new product development personnel. The technical language spoken by the new product personnel also increased the inertia of old technology push development process by making it more prestigious and comfortable to plan new products with their technology suppliers. The fact that the firm was doing well throughout this process also decreased the pressure to change from their established new product development routine. The implications for these finding are that: 1) it is necessary to pressure or reward personnel in order to make permanent changes to established routines, and 2) researchers should be careful at taking managers at their word when asking them about their future intentions.

"Research summary: Because employees can provide a firm with human capital advantages over competitors, firms invest considerably in employee recruiting and retention. Departing from the retention imperative of strategic human capital management, we propose that certain employee departures can enhance a firm's competitiveness in the labor market. Specifically, increased rates of career-advancing departures by a firm's employees can signal to potential future employees that the firm offers a prestigious employment experience that enhances external mobility opportunities. Characterizing advancement based on subsequent employers and positions, we analyze data on U.S. law firm hiring and industry surveys of perceived firm status between 2004 and 2013. We find that increased rates of employee departures lead to increases in a firm's prestige when these departures are for promotions with high-status competitors. Managerial summary: Firms often emphasize employee retention. Employee departures, especially as a result of being hired away by competitors, are often viewed as threats to a firm's competitive advantage. We propose, however, that employee retention need not be an unconditional strategic imperative. We argue that certain employee departures can enhance a firm's competitiveness in the market for human capital by signaling to potential employees that the firm offers a prestigious employment experience, which can help them obtain attractive positions with other employers. Analyzing data on U.S. law firm hiring and industry surveys of firm associates between 2004 and 2013, we find that increased rates of employee departures lead to increases in a firm's prestige when these departures are for promotions with high-status competitors.

In the first study, we use a between-subjects factorial design to test whether the presence of an online privacy policy influences consumer trust and find that consumers are likely to respond more favorably to a shopping site with a clearly stated privacy message than to one without it, especially when privacy risk is high. In our second experiment, we examine the effects of different forms of privacy disclosures. The results suggest that online shoppers find a short, straightforward privacy statement more comprehensible than a lengthy, legalistic one.

"How does entrepreneurial leadership drive the process of forming and advancing opportunity? Drawing from an ethnographic field study of Nashville music producers, I develop a model of entrepreneurial leadership as creative brokering - the practices and process by which entrepreneurs lead and mobilize a complex network of actors in co-creating and advancing opportunity. I find that entrepreneurial leaders encounter three tensions as they advance this process: 1) generating novel ideas and fitting them within the competitive landscape; 2) incubating opportunity and seizing the moment in the market; and 3) fostering experimentation and navigating hyper-competition. I show when these tensions arise and identify six creative brokering practices through which leaders leverage their brokerage role to navigate these tensions in order to move opportunity forward. The paper offers a model of entrepreneurial leadership as creative brokering, extends extant creative brokering scholarship to consider more distal market actors, and shows how creative brokering and leadership towards creative outcomes involve iteratively stepping forward to infuse market perspective and exert control, and stepping back to let others shine and co-create ideas.","['brokerage and brokering', 'creativity', 'entrepreneurial leadership', 'ethnography', 'process', 'VENTURE PERFORMANCE', 'TERTIUS IUNGENS', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'GROWTH', 'INNOVATION', 'DISCOVERY', 'SKILL', 'FIELD']","['entrepreneurial leadership', 'process', 'field']",[],0,0.0
"Consumers can experience major life events (e.g., the birth of a child or retirement) that have key strategic managerial implications for firms in terms of creating new market segments as well as preventing defection from existing brands. Therefore, in the context of a consumer-based strategy, this study investigates whether life events change actual purchase behavior as well as how three important and managerially actionable consumer difference variables (consumer innovativeness, the variety seeking tendency, and price consciousness) mediate this link. Purchase records of an individual-level consumer panel, combined with demographic and survey data over a three-year period, indicate that there is a direct link between life events and changes in share of wallet (SOW) and share of units (SOU) for the preferred brand in a product category. Further, experiencing a life event leads to an increase in consumer innovativeness that, in turn, decreases SOW/SOU for the preferred brand for some purchases, while at the same time leading to a decrease in consumers' variety seeking tendency and price consciousness for others that, in turn, lead to an increase in SOW/SOU. These findings suggest a paradox of change that can both enhance and inhibit purchasing new brands. Finally, the effects of first-time life events (i.e., significant markers in the course of life that occur for the first time) are stronger than the effects of repeated life events, and life events with a positive economic impact have a strong negative effect on change in price consciousness.","['Life events', 'Consumer innovativeness', 'Variety seeking tendency', 'Price consciousness', 'LEVEL', 'BRAND', 'IMPACT', 'PERSONALITY', 'CATEGORY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'MODEL', 'SHARE', 'PERSPECTIVES', 'STRATEGY']","['life events', 'consumer innovativeness', 'variety seeking tendency', 'price consciousness', 'level', 'brand', 'impact', 'category', 'behavior', 'share', 'strategy']","['consumer innovativeness', 'variety seeking', 'price consciousness']",0.6666666666666666,0.18181818181818182

In this multisited ethnography, we explore the ways in which active consumers negotiate meanings about the consumption of a particular public good, public space. Using the context of street art, we document four main ideologies of public space consumption that result from the interaction, both conflict and common intent, of urban dwellers and street artists. We show how public space can be contested as private and commercialized, or offered back as a collective good, where sense of belonging and dialogue restore it to a meaningful place. We demonstrate how the common nature of space both stimulates dialectical and dialogical exchanges across stakeholders and fuels forms of layered agency.","['nan', 'CONSUMPTION', 'SPEAKING', 'APPROPRIATION', 'SERVICESCAPES', 'ETHNOGRAPHY', 'IMAGINATION', 'CONSUMERS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'CULTURE', 'INQUIRY']","['consumption', 'ethnography', 'consumers']","['public goods', 'ethnography', 'street art']",0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
"Although the concept of absorptive capacity has gained wide acceptance in the literature, our understanding of the origins of a firm's ability to absorb and leverage new knowledge is limited. Drawing on Coleman's (1990) bathtub framework for macro-micro-macro-relations in social science, this study explores the multilevel antecedents of absorptive capacity using survey data gathered from 342 informants at different levels of analysis in 106 medical technology firms. Multilevel structural equation modeling analyses indicate that formal and informal integration mechanisms are positively related to absorptive capacity at the organizational level and that this relationship is mediated through a microlevel process. The findings reveal that knowledge workers' cognitive process of perspective taking and their creative behavior are important microfoundations of absorptive capacity.

"This study draws on depth interviews with 49 managers in customer firms and 55 managers in supplier firms and on discussions with 21 managers in two focus groups to propose a new way of thinking about customer solutions. Extant literature and suppliers interviewed for this study view a solution as a customized and integrated combination of goods and services for meeting a customer's business needs. In contrast, customers view a solution as a set of customer-supplier relational processes comprising (1) customer requirements definition, (2) customization and integration of goods and/or services and (3) their deployment, and (4) postdeployment customer support, all of which are aimed at meeting customers' business needs. The relational process view can help suppliers deliver more effective solutions at profitable prices. In addition, field research suggests that the effectiveness of a solution depends not only on supplier variables but also on several customer variables. Supplier variables include contingent hierarchy, documentation emphasis, incentive externality, customer interactor stability, and process articulation. Customer variables include adaptiveness to supplier offerings and political and operational counseling that a customer provides to a supplier. Several of these variables underscore the importance of suppliers developing social capital with customers.

We focus on the commonalities of the literatures that deal with matrix organization and project management. With a definition of cross-functional organization in hand, we review the literature for advantages and disadvantages of these organization forms, ending the section with a discussion of the great need for empirical research to resolve numerous questions and paradoxes. Finally, we review a model for effective cross-functional organizations, comprising environmental influences, organizational characteristics, project characteristics, project team characteristics, project leader characteristics, and project effectiveness. Each section ends with a discussion of needed research, and the article ends with a call for research and theory building regarding cross-functional organizations, which continue to grow in application importance.","['nan', 'PERFORMANCE', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'SUCCESS', 'DESIGN', 'TEAMS', 'COMMUNICATION', 'MODEL', 'WORK']",['model'],[],0,0.0
We consider boards as human groups in the uppermost echelon of corporations and examine how an informal hierarchy that tacitly forms among a firm's directors affects firm financial performance. This informal hierarchy is based on directors' deference for one another. We argue that the clarity of the informal hierarchy can help coordinate boardroom interactions and thereby improve the likelihood of the board's contributing productively to the firm's performance. We further identify a set of internal and external contingencies affecting the functioning of the informal hierarchy. Our analysis of seven-year panel data on 530 U.S. manufacturing firms provides support for our arguments.,"['nan', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'STRATEGIC PERSISTENCE', 'SOCIAL-STRUCTURE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'DIRECTORS', 'AGENCY', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'MANAGEMENT', 'HETEROGENEITY', 'INDEPENDENCE']",['directors'],[],0,0.0
"Virtual customer environments (VCE), which provide services ranging from online discussion forums to virtual design toolkits, enable firms to involve their customers in innovation and value creation. Evidently, companies can benefit from operating such VCEs; however, most firms do not seem to attach sufficient importance to the nature of customers' interactions in the VCE. In this study, we examine two critical implications of customers' interactions in a product-support focused VCE. First, we suggest that customers' perceptions of interaction-based benefits will shape their future participation in product support in the VCE. Second, customers' interactions will also generate changes in their affective states, and these, in turn, influence their attitude towards the firm. Our empirical work provides broad support for the study hypotheses and implies the need for firms to carefully design and implement VCEs that facilitate positive interaction experiences for customers. Implications with respect to customer value co-creation and customer relationship management are discussed.","['nan', 'BRAND COMMUNITY', 'SOCIAL-INFLUENCE', 'INNOVATION', 'INTERNET', 'INFORMATION', 'ONLINE', 'USERS', 'FIRM', 'GRATIFICATIONS', 'PARTICIPATION']","['innovation', 'online', 'firm', 'participation']",['product support'],0.0,0.0
"The authors revisit the evidence presented in Martinez et al. using new data and estimation techniques that take into account unobserved firm heterogeneity. The results of the earlier study are found to be robust to the new procedures because performance of family-controlled firms continues to be superior to that of nonfamily firms. The authors then add the risk dimension to the earlier analysis using a risk-adjusted return on assets (ROA) variable, and family-controlled firms again performed better. A test of the standard deviations of ROA for both firm categories revealed that family-controlled firms not only perform better but also show less volatility in their returns.","['family-controlled firms', 'performance', 'ROA', 'risk', 'returns volatility', 'nan']","['family controlled firms', 'performance', 'roa', 'risk']",['unobserved'],0.0,0.0

"Along with other affective and emotional dimensions, passion is at the heart of entrepreneurship. Yet past research on entrepreneurial passion (EP) has been hindered by the lack of a sound measurement instrument. Through a series of empirical studies conducted with samples from relevant populations, we develop and validate an instrument to capture EP and its inherent dimensions. We show that the task-specific dimensions of EP (intense positive feelings toward the domains of inventing, founding and developing, and the centrality of these domains to entrepreneurs' self-identity) are conceptually and empirically distinct from one another, and from other emotions and cognitions known to play a role in entrepreneurship. Our theory and results indicate that proper measurement of entrepreneurial passion incorporates the interaction between entrepreneurs' feelings and identity centrality for each domain. We discuss the implications of our model, instrument and findings for future research on the affective components of innovation and entrepreneurship. We also develop specific guidelines for using our validated instrument in future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"In the entrepreneurial setting, financial intermediaries such as venture capital firms (VCs) are perhaps the dominant source of selection shaping the environment within which new ventures evolve. VCs affect selection both by acting as a scout able to identify future potential and as a coach that can help realize it. Despite the large literature on the role of VCs in encouraging startups, it, is generally taken for granted that VCs are expert scouts and coaches, and so the ways in which VCs actually enhance startup performance are not well understood. In this study, we examine whether VCs' emphasize picking winners or building them by comparing the effects of startups' alliance, intellectual, and human capital characteristics on VCs decisions to finance them with the effects of the same characteristics on future startup performance. Our findings point to a joint logic that combines the roles: VCs finance startups that have strong technology, but are at risk of failure in the short run, and so in need of management expertise. Our findings thus support the belief in VC expertise, but only to a point. VCs also appear to make a common attribution error overemphasizing startups' human capital when making their investment decisions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The qualitative examination of the actions of rural entrepreneurs finds that embeddedness plays a key role in shaping and sustaining business. Being embedded in the social structure creates opportunity and improves performance. Embedding enabled the entrepreneurs to use the specifics of the environment. Thus, both recognition and realisation of opportunity are conditioned by the entrepreneurs' role in the social structure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

"It is commonly asserted that the field of strategic management is fragmented and lacks a coherent identity. This skepticism, however, is paradoxically at odds with the great success that strategic management has enjoyed. How might one explain this paradox? We seek answers to this question by relying first on a large-scale survey of strategic management scholars from which we derive an implicit consensual definition of the field-as tacitly held by its members. We then supplement this implicit definition with an examination of the espoused definitions of the field obtained from a group of boundary-spanning scholars. Our findings suggest that strategic management's success as afield emerges from an underlying consensus that enables it to attract multiple perspectives, while still maintaining its coherent distinctiveness.

"To build profitable market positions, new ventures have to address multiple challenges on several fronts. These ventures can compete by being simple (focused) or applying varied ways to compete. The likelihood of these ventures remaining competitive depends on their ability to build novelty into their products and operations, an activity that requires infusing knowledge into their operations. Most ventures, however, have limited knowledge bases and the reach (scope) of their external connections is limited, a factor that prompts them to tap into different external sources in their local areas. This article reports an empirical study of 140 new ventures located in seven regional clusters in Spain. The results show that new ventures can enrich the variety of their strategic repertoire by accessing diverse sources of external knowledge and being exposed to external novel knowledge, while absorptive capacity moderates this relationship. The degree of social development of these clusters also has a positive impact on the strategic variety of new ventures, exhibiting an inverted U-shape curve. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

"The phenomenon of outsourcing is becoming increasingly widespread among organizations and is now one of the strategic decisions that attract the greatest interest from professionals and organizational scholars. The primary purpose of the paper is to contribute with a review of the principal works that address outsourcing from the resource-based view of the firm (RBV). The paper begins by setting out the main premises of outsourcing and then presents the different concepts of outsourcing and proposes a concept that is more in line with the theoretical framework used. This is followed by an analysis of the principal differences and similarities of the treatments of outsourcing from the traditional perspective of the transaction costs economics theory (TCE) and from the more strategic and up-to-date RBV. The next section contains a review of the most significant theoretical and empirical works on outsourcing that address outsourcing from the RBV. The contributions are classified into two categories, depending on the objectives: works that study the propensity to outsource and works that study the relationship between the outsourcing decision and organizational performance. Finally, a framework is proposed that is based on the resource and capability view with the aim of contributing to a better understanding of outsourcing and facilitating future empirical works from the RBV that are complementary and examine issues of greater interest that have been less developed in the literature to date.","['nan', 'TRANSACTION COST', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'VERTICAL INTEGRATION', 'STRATEGY', 'BUY', 'CAPABILITIES', 'IMPACT', 'HR', 'COLLABORATION', 'ORGANIZATION']","['transaction cost', 'organization']","['resource based view', 'transaction costs']",0.0,0.0

"Current models of competitive advantage emphasize economic factors as explanations for a firm's success bur ignore sociocognitive factors. This paper integrates economic and cognitive perspectives, and shows how firms and constituents jointly construct the environments in which firms compete. We argue that competitive advantage is a systemic outcome that develops as firms and constituents participate in six processes that entail, not only use and exchange of resources, but also communication about and interpretations of those exchanges. The interpretations that firms and constituents make of competitive interactions affect decisions about how to exchange and use resources. As interpretations and evaluations of a given firm fluctuate, so do the resources the firm has access to and its competitive advantage in the marketplace. The actions and interpretations of constituents and rivals produce the shifting terrain on which competition unfolds. We illustrate these dynamics with a discussion of IBM's changing competitive advantage in the computer industry in the 1980s.

"The pendulum appears to be swinging away from the merger mania of the 1980s, with many leaner-and meaner organizations refocusing on their core competencies. However, these more focused organizations often lack the breadth of skills and expertise necessary for developing products and services which cut across traditional technological and marketing boundaries. Complex product systems such as those under development in the home automation industry include elements from such disparate sectors as consumer electronics, telecommunications, construction, and energy. A narrow focus may prevent the novel forms of innovation necessary for successful development of such products. Using the home automation industry as an example, Joe Tidd examines the challenges involved in the development of complex product systems. When products and services cut across traditional marketing and technological boundaries, radical innovation is difficult because different firms and industries are typically responsible for developing the various subsystems and components. Successful development efforts may require novel forms of innovation-for example, architectural innovation and technology fusion. Architectural innovation involves changes in the way the components of a product are linked together, but leaves the core design concepts untouched. Technology fusion creates new products and market opportunities through the blending of diverse technologies from various fields. Two organizational factors affect a firm's ability to develop and commercialize new products based on novel forms of innovation: the internal organization of the firm, and the firm's links with other organizations, including suppliers, customers, and networks of collaborating organizations. Within a firm, the development of complex product systems is likely to require managing across traditional product-division boundaries. The breadth of competencies required may necessitate strong interfirm linkages. Comparing organizational approaches and the networks of alliances for home automation in the United States, Europe, and Japan, it appears that European firms tend to be more narrowly focused then American and Japanese firms. A rigid focus on core competencies may cause these European firms to overlook the potential for new products. Because various technologies and industries are involved, open networks are more effective than closed networks or alliances. European and American firms tend to favor closed strategic alliances, while Japanese firms typically participate in open networks and overlapping consortia. This approach gives Japanese firms an edge in the home automation industry.","['nan', 'INNOVATION', 'INDUSTRY', 'STRATEGY']","['innovation', 'industry']",[],0,0.0
"This paper draws upon three broad perspectives on the strategic decision-making process in order to develop a more completely specified model of strategic decision effectiveness in a different context, namely Egypt. The key variables in this model consist of three strategic decision-making process dimensions (rationality, intuition, and political behavior); seven moderating variables concerning decision-specific, environmental, and organizational factors; and strategic decision effectiveness as an outcome variable. A two-stage study was conducted in which the first stage provided exploratory insights and the second stage investigated hypotheses on the impact of strategic decision-making process dimensions on strategic decision effectiveness and the moderating role of broader contextual variables. The second-stage study produced three major findings: (1) both rational and political processes appear to have more influence on strategic decision effectiveness than does intuition; (2) strategic decision effectiveness is both process- and context-specific; and (3) certain results support the 'culture-free' argument, while others support the 'culture-specific' argument.

"Individual decision makers show robust tendencies toward choosing compromise options. But what happens when consumers make choices with someone else? This article examines the choice of compromise options in joint dyadic decisions. Findings reveal that preferences for compromise alternatives replicate in mixedgender and female-female dyads as among individuals but are attenuated when two males make a choice together. Moreover, when two males make joint choices, their tendency to choose the compromise alternative decreases not only relative to other types of pairs but also to male and female individual decision makers. Evidence is presented that this happens because male-male dyadic contexts cue gender dichotomization, behavior that is consistent with masculine but not feminine gender norms. Because the extremity in decision making is maximally consistent with masculine but not feminine gender role norms, male-male dyads exhibit lower preferences for compromise options. However, if men have an opportunity to signal masculinity to one another prior to making joint compromise choices, male-male dyads prefer compromise options at proportions no different from female-female dyads. This work brings together the judgment and decisionmaking literature with insights from the social psychology literature, identifying a case when gender role norms have profound influences on classic judgment and decision-making effects.","['compromise effect', 'extremeness aversion', 'dyadic decisions', 'joint decision making', 'gender', 'CONSUMER DECISION-MAKING', 'EXTREMENESS AVERSION', 'PRECARIOUS MANHOOD', 'ATTRIBUTE-BALANCE', 'SEX-DIFFERENCES', 'CHOICE', 'CONTEXT', 'ACCOUNTABILITY', 'ATTRACTION', 'PREFERENCE']","['dyadic decisions', 'gender', 'choice', 'context', 'preference']","['choices', 'gender']",0.5,0.2
"As an organizational form, cooperatives are increasingly being used throughout the world across different industries and sectors. While it has been suggested that various benefits can be derived from shared ownership, cooperatives are often characterized by conflict among members that, in turn, can lead to eventual failure of the cooperatives. Existing theory has suggested that the choice of formal control structure can play an important role in mitigating conflict, but a longstanding debate exists as to whether flat versus hierarchical control structures are more effective. To add further insight into this theoretical discussion, we conducted a field experiment involving 40 newly formed cooperatives in rural Ghana, which were randomly assigned to either a flat or hierarchical control structure. The quantitative results of our field experiment and subsequent qualitative data suggest that formal hierarchical control structures lead to lower levels of collective psychological ownership, which in turn result in higher levels of conflict compared to flat control structures within cooperatives. However, our results also suggest that the extent to which the choice of formal control structures influences conflict among cooperative members can be highly dependent on the absence or presence of an informal hierarchy.","['nan', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP', 'EMPLOYEE ATTITUDES', 'POWER', 'WORK', 'DIFFERENTIATION', 'ENTREPRENEURS', 'ORGANIZATION', 'CORPORATIONS', 'NETWORKS', 'ECONOMY']","['psychological ownership', 'organization']","['organizational', 'cooperatives', 'ownership', 'psychological ownership']",0.25,0.5
"Research summary: Although the middle management literature has identified various bridging roles performed by middle managers in the market environment, it is relatively vague about whether and how they manage the political environment to achieve market-related goals. In an inductive field study of four large state-owned enterprises based in mainland Communist China, operational middle managers were found to take an active role in dealing with political actors to achieve market efficiency in their local environments, performing two distinct bridging strategies. Our field study suggests that middle managers are better equipped than their bosses (top executives) as well as their subordinates (frontline employees) to perform the bridging function between competing market and political imperatives in various local settings. Managerial summary: For firms that operate in diverse geographies, it is challenging for a handful of top executives to deal with numerous political actors. This burden could be shared with operational middle managers, who play a bridging role by drawing on their operational knowledge and local networks. Our research on middle managers who work under the scrutiny of political actors in China found that they bridge market and political ideology by conveying common features that seem legitimate to both. They also bridge market goals and political actors with personal affect. Compared to top executives and frontline employees, middle managers have unique advantages in performing these bridging functions. Firms can enhance their strategy execution ability by training middle managers in dealing with political actors in diverse contexts.

Using longitudinal data on 469 U.S. firms, we found support for three hypotheses. Contrary to our expectations, firms with an explicit environmental pay policy and an environmental committee do not reward environmental strategies more than those without such structures, suggesting that these mechanisms play a merely symbolic role.","['nan', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'CEO COMPENSATION', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT', 'BOARD COMPOSITION', 'CORPORATE BOARDS', 'RISK', 'OWNERSHIP', 'IMPACT', 'PAY']",['pay'],['institutional theory'],0.0,0.0
"This study addressed the ill-understood issue of how loyalty develops in service patrons. Although many theorists hold commitment to be an essential part of this process, the link between commitment and loyalty has received little empirical attention. To address this void, the study first portrayed commitment's root tendency to resist changing preference as a function of three antecedent processes. Second, this portrayal formed the basis for developing a psychometrically sound scale to measure the construct of commitment. Third, the scale was then used in a mediating effects model (M-E-M) to test the commitment-loyalty link. Path analyses found this parsimonious structure to be a significant improvement over rival direct effects models (D-E-Ms). Results found the tendency to resist changing preference to be a key precursor to loyalty, largely explained by a patron's willingness to identify with a brand. Implications of these findings for loyalty's development and research are explored.","['nan', 'BRAND LOYALTY', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL COMMITMENT', 'ATTITUDE-CHANGE', 'MODEL', 'SATISFACTION', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'BEHAVIOR', 'DETERMINANTS', 'VALIDITY', 'THOUGHT']",['model'],"['loyalty', 'commitment', 'model']",0.3333333333333333,1.0

"The present research proposes that luxury consumption can be a double-edged sword: while luxury consumption yields status benefits, it can also make consumers feel inauthentic, producing what we call the impostor syndrome from luxury consumption. As a result, paradoxically, luxury consumption may backfire and lead consumers to behave less confidently due to their undermined feelings of self-authenticity. Feelings of inauthenticity from luxury consumption may arise because consumers perceive luxury as an undue privilege. These feelings are less pronounced among consumers with high levels of chronic psychological entitlement, and they are reduced when consumers' sense of entitlement is temporarily boosted. The effects are robust across studies conducted in the lab and in field settings such as the Metropolitan Opera, Martha's Vineyard, a luxury shopping center, and the Upper East Side in New York, featuring relevant participant populations including luxury target segments and consumption contexts including consumers' reflections on their actual past luxury purchases.","['luxury', 'self-authenticity', 'psychological entitlement', 'symbolic consumption', 'NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY-INVENTORY', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL ENTITLEMENT', 'CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION', 'CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR', 'SELF', 'AUTHENTICITY', 'SIGNALS', 'DESERVINGNESS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'PREFERENCES']","['luxury', 'self authenticity', 'psychological entitlement', 'psychological entitlement', 'self', 'authenticity']","['luxury consumption', 'impostor syndrome', 'self', 'inauthenticity', 'psychological entitlement', 'luxury purchases']",0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
"Research summary: This study explores the effect of knowledge integration on strategic renewal.

In contrast to prior work, the study hypothesizes and finds that new outside rookiesthose new to top management and the firmare associated with higher firm growth than other types of executives. We also find that seasoned outsidersthose with prior TMT experience outside the focal industrycontribute to growth only when the existing TMT has a long tenure. The results suggest that the ability of the TMT to integrate new members varies by executive type and has an important effect on incremental strategic renewal.Managerial summary: Conventional wisdom holds that firms are better off hiring those who can demonstrate prior experience and skill in tasks as close as possible to the job. In the realm of the top management team (TMT), however, we find that many firms benefit from hiring rookies from other firms who are new to the top management team level. These candidates bring useful knowledge of the operations of competitors and other firms, and they are easier to socialize and integrate with the existing team. While more experienced senior leaders may bring valuable strategic knowledge, this study suggests that only top management teams with long shared experience can weather the disruption that they cause to realize the potential benefits.

"Travelers increasingly consider electronic word of mouth (e-WOM) from online review platforms when making their accommodation decisions. Theory predicts that e-WOM increases sales, but little is known regarding the role that branding plays in the relation between e-WOM and hotels' financial performance. This study relied on financial data (including Revenue per Available RoomRevPARand sales profitability) and 34,164 online customer reviews gathered from TripAdvisor (as a proxy for e-WOM) based on panel data from 221 hotels, including not-branded and branded chain hotels in France from 2005 to 2013. The results show that the volume of reviews has no effect on RevPAR growth for branded chain hotels and a positive effect on RevPAR growth for not-branded chain hotels. In addition, the direct effect of the valence of online reviews and its interaction effect with the yearly and cumulative volume of online reviews on RevPAR growth and sales profitability is shown to apply to not-branded chain hotels but not to branded chain hotels. This study contributes to the e-WOM literature by revealing the role of a brand in e-WOM's impact on hotel financial performance.

These studies have focused almost exclusively on examining performance differences within a single country, thus treating country effects as external to business unit performance. In contrast, this study focuses on multinational corporations and examines the extent to which country effects explain the variation in the performance of foreign affiliates. Our findings show that country effects are as strong as industry effects, following affiliate effects. and corporate effects. Our results also suggest that corporate and affiliate effects tend to be more critical in explaining the variation in foreign affiliate performance in developed countries, whereas country and industry effects are more salient in developing countries.

"Drawing on justice theory, I examined the consequences of abusive supervisor behavior. As expected, subordinates who perceived their supervisors were more abusive were more likely to quit their jobs. For subordinates who remained with their jobs, abusive supervision was associated with lower job and life satisfaction, lower normative and affective commitment, and higher continuance commitment, conflict between work and family, and psychological distress. Organizational justice mediated most of these effects, and job mobility moderated some of the deleterious effects of abusive supervision.","['nan', 'MEDICAL-STUDENT ABUSE', 'DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE', 'PETTY TYRANNY', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'SATISFACTION', 'ATTITUDES', 'WORKPLACE', 'TURNOVER', 'MEDIATOR', 'CONFLICT']","['satisfaction', 'conflict']","['life satisfaction', 'job mobility']",0.0,0.0
"Using ethnographic evidence from the former Soviet republics, this paper examines a relatively new and mainly unobserved concept in international business literature: the phenomenon of communication disengagement that manifests itself in many emerging markets. We link it to the deficiencies of the local professional business discourse rooted in language limitations, which reflects a lack of experience with the market economy. This hampers cognitive coherence between foreign and local business entities, adding to the liability of foreignness as certain instances of professional experience fail to find adequate linguistic expression, and complicates cross-cultural adjustments, causing multinational companies (MNCs) financial losses. We contribute to the IB literature by examining cross-border semantic sensemaking through a retrospectively constructed observational study. We argue that a relative inadequacy of the national professional idiom is likely to remain a feature of the business environment in post-communist economies for some time, and therefore should be factored into business strategies of MNCs. Consequently, we recommend including discursive hazards in the risk evaluation of international projects.","['cross-cultural research/measurement issues', 'emerging markets/countries/economies', 'economic and/or cultural risks in emerging markets', 'liability of foreignness', 'language (language design, silent language, translation)', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES', 'CULTURAL BARRIERS', 'EASTERN-EUROPE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'ETHNOGRAPHY', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'RUSSIA']",['liability of foreignness'],"['discourse', 'liability of foreignness', 'sensemaking']",0.3333333333333333,1.0
"Extant diversity climate research has been based primarily upon the Interactional Model of Cultural Diversity (IMCD). While prior research has supported the beneficial effects of prodiversity climates (i.e., work environments that employees view as fair and socially integrative of all personnel) on worker attitudes and behaviors, less is known about the potential boundary conditions of diversity climate-outcome relationships. To address this concern, we conducted a meta-analysis of diversity climate using 109 independent samples from 94 studies. Meta-analytic results indicate that diversity climate-outcome relationships are moderated by climate measure type, outcome type, demographic diversity, climate strength, and measurement source. These findings show that diversity climate is more strongly related to outcomes when measured as inclusion climate (vs. diversity climate), for attitudinal outcomes compared to performance and withdrawal criteria, when work contexts are more racially and ethnically diverse, when personnel exhibit stronger versus weaker agreement in their diversity climate perceptions, and when diversity climate and outcome data are collected from the same source versus different sources.

"Although highly relevant for marketing practice, few studies provide conceptual and empirical insights into customer portfolio management. Furthermore, most approaches to analyzing customer portfolios are static. This article discusses three neglected key issues relevant for a dynamic customer portfolio analysis: (1) Does a static versus a dynamic valuation lead to a different prioritization of customer segments in a portfolio? (2) How does offensive or defensive management of segment dynamics affect portfolio value? and (3) Do reliable predictors for dynamics of a customer's position in the portfolio exist? As a tool for customer portfolio analysis, the authors develop a segment-based customer-lifetime-value model. They capture customer dynamics by analyzing how customers switch between segments of different values across time. The authors apply their tool with longitudinal data from four firms with up to 300,000 customers. The results from the empirical analysis and a simulation study provide answers to the three key issues raised. First, compared with a dynamic analysis, a static approach overestimates the value of some customer segments but underestimates others. Second, a defensive versus offensive management of value dynamics is relatively more appropriate for middle-tier segments, whereas the opposite holds true for bottom-tier segments. Third, general customer characteristics and aggregated transaction characteristics indicate future segment dynamics, whereas specific product usage data differentiate customers according to current value.","['customer portfolio management', 'customer segment value', 'Markov model', 'customer relationship management', 'data mining', 'MARKETING MODELS', 'SERVICE RETENTION', 'LIFETIME VALUE', 'ACQUISITION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'EQUITY', 'PROFITABILITY', 'DECISIONS', 'FRAMEWORK', 'IMPACT']","['customer portfolio management', 'lifetime value', 'management']","['customer portfolio management', 'dynamics', 'customer lifetime value model']",0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
"A new product's success in the marketplace largely depends on salesforce actions. Many B2B salespeople display conservatism when confronted with new products in their portfolio, such that they maximize their efforts to sell existing products before engaging in efforts to sell the new product. So far, it is unclear whether this conservative selling behavior (CSB) is harmful to new product selling performance, and how this behavior can be managed. Building on perceived risk processing theory, and employing multi-level structural equation modeling on a multi-source dataset, the authors empirically substantiate that salespeople's CSB makes their effort to sell new products more effective. Remarkably, such effort is then valued less by sales managers. The authors also find that CSB is a result of a risk assessment and evaluation process, in which internal marketing efforts (i.e., providing salespeople with information on the new product) determine the weight of perceived performance risk (i.e., new product radicalness), social risk (i.e., managerial new product orientation), and financial risk (i.e., long-term rewards). Managers looking to control the levels of CSB in their salesforce should carefully align their information support activities with the perceived risk dimensions of the new product selling situation.","['Sales management', 'Salesperson performance', 'New products', 'Conservative selling behavior', 'Business-to-business', 'Perceived risk processing theory', 'WORKING SMART', 'SALES FORCE', 'CUSTOMER ORIENTATION', 'PERCEIVED-RISK', 'SALESPEOPLE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MEDIATION', 'DECISION', 'ADOPTION', 'IMPACT']","['new products', 'conservative selling behavior', 'perceived risk processing theory', 'perceived risk', 'salespeople', 'performance']","['performance', 'perceived risk']",1.0,0.3333333333333333

"The entrepreneurial journey is often experienced as an emotional rollercoaster, but we know very little about how entrepreneurs can ride it most effectively to increase their ventures' chances of survival. We investigate how entrepreneurs' habitual use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression - two well-established types of emotion regulation - impact on the likelihood of their venture surviving. Drawing on a sample of 183 technology ventures, we find that both regulation types are generally associated with a lower survival likelihood, but that these effects depend on the venture's performance.

"In this paper, we examine the strategic use of debt in franchise organizations. We focus on both the franchisee's and the franchisor's capital structures. The primary goal of this study is to examine whether franchisors impose limits on franchisees' debt levels to be able to increase their own leverage. We find that the franchisor's leverage is significantly related to the maximum leverage allowed for the franchisee. As the franchisor sets an upper limit on the franchisee's debt ratio, the franchisor can raise more debt and therefore seizes tax benefits, since interest payments are tax deductible. We find that this effect is stronger in chains with larger fractions of franchised outlets. (C) 2010 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"This study examines the pivotal role of ambidextrous innovation in the strategy performance thesis of the export ventures of high-technology international new venture (INV) firms. To date, the literature on INVs has failed to consider ambidextrous innovation in the strategy interplay in approaching new markets overseas. Building on the resource-based view of the firm, the authors empirically examine the relationships among competitive strategy, innovation ambidexterity, positional advantage, and export venture performance. In the context of Mexican high-technology INVs, the authors find that innovation ambidexterity codetermines both marketing differentiation and cost leadership advantages, and together these link to export venture performance gains. The authors reveal that marketing differentiation and cost leadership strategies positively influence differentiation and cost advantages, respectively. They observe hybrid strategy to influence marketing differentiation advantage inversely. Moreover, marketing differentiation strategy alone is important in driving innovation ambidexterity.

"A key decision for the design of principal-agent agreements is how much control or authority the buyer (or principal) should be allowed to exercise in relation to the seller (or agent). Historically, agency theory has viewed exchange agreements as ranging from those in which the buyer has very high authority over the seller (formal authority) to those in which the buyer and seller are relatively independent so there is little or no authority relation (market exchange). However, some principal-agent agreements reverse the authority relationship usually assumed in agency theory by allowing the seller to exercise authority over the buyer. The authors study this unexplored type of agency agreement and refer to it as authority relinquishment. Using data collected from interviews with clients and guides on commercial high-altitude mountain expeditions, the authors identify conditions that make authority relinquishment likely. They also identify the benefits and drawbacks of authority relinquishment and compare them with the benefits and drawbacks of two frequently studied approaches to managing agency relationships-formal authority and authority decentralization.","['agency theory', 'transaction cost analysis', 'governance', 'authority', 'Everest', 'INCENTIVES', 'INFORMATION', 'FIRM', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'JOB', 'PERSPECTIVES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'GOVERNANCE']","['agency theory', 'authority']","['principal agent agreements', 'agency theory', 'authority relinquishment']",0.3333333333333333,0.5
"Corporate social responsibility is commonly viewed solely as a tool for enhancing company reputations and engendering goodwill among customers. In contrast, this research shows that the impact of corporate social responsibility can extend beyond public relations and customer goodwill to influence the way consumers evaluate a company's products. Specifically, this research documents that acts of social goodwill-even when they are unrelated to the company's core business, as in the case of charitable giving-can alter product perceptions, such that products of companies engaged in prosocial activities are perceived as performing better. More important, the data show that inferences drawn from a company's prosocial actions are strong enough to alter the product evaluations even when consumers can directly observe and experience the product. The data further show that this effect is a function of the moral undertone of the company's motivation for engaging in socially responsible behavior and is attenuated when consumers believe that the company's behavior is driven by self-interest rather than by benevolence. By documenting that social goodwill can benefit consumer perceptions of product performance, these findings show that doing good can indeed translate into doing well.","['nan', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'CSR ACTIVITIES', 'PUBLIC-GOODS', 'CREATE VALUE', 'CONSUMERS', 'FIRM', 'PURCHASE', 'IMPACT', 'DIFFERENTIATION', 'INTUITIONS']","['consumers', 'impact']","['corporate', 'responsibility', 'performance']",0.0,0.0
"Two important areas are underexplored in the relationship between marketing resources and performance. First, the subject has been primarily investigated in the context Of Western countries, and inadequate attention has been given to emerging economies. Second, despite the recent growth in globalization, the moderating role of globalization on the link between marketing resources and performance has not been investigated. Addressing these important gaps, this article focuses on an emerging economy (China) and explores the moderating effect of globalization on this link. Specifically, the authors develop several hypotheses highlighting the moderating role of globalization activities (global product sourcing, global market seeking, and global partnership) on the link between marketing resources (market orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, and innovative capability) and firm performance.

Second, in addition to examining the effects of environments, technology, and organizational complexity, we assess the effects of the organization's strategic orientation on the design of planning processes. Third, we move towards a configurational approach and explore the effects of concurrent presence of multiple contingencies. The study uses data from a large sample of North American corporations. The results suggest that the forces of context govern the design of planning processes. Furthermore, exploration of the effects of concurrent presence of multiple contingencies provides interesting illustrations of situations where the forces of context are aligned in the same direction as well as situations where the forces pull in opposite directions.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-STRUCTURE', 'ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'IMPACT', 'SYSTEM', 'DIMENSIONS', 'DECISIONS', 'COMPANIES']",['dimensions'],[],0,0.0
"Consumers have an increasingly wide variety of options available to entertain themselves. This poses a challenge for content aggregators who want to effectively promote their video content online through original trailers of movies, sitcoms, and video games. Marketers are now trying to produce much shorter video clips to promote their content on a variety of digital channels. This research is the first to propose an approach to produce such clips and to study their effectiveness, focusing on comedy movies as an application. Web-based facial-expression tracking is used to study viewers' real-time emotional responses when watching comedy movie trailers online. These data are used to predict both viewers' intentions to watch the movie and the movie's box office success. The authors then propose an optimization procedure for cutting scenes from trailers to produce clips and test it in an online experiment and in a field experiment. The results provide evidence that the production of short clips using the proposed methodology can be an effective tool to market movies and other online content.","['video content marketing', 'trailers', 'clips', 'emotions', 'facial-expression tracking', 'BOX-OFFICE', 'CONSUMPTION', 'PREFERENCES', 'SELECTION', 'EMOTION', 'SUCCESS', 'ADVERTISEMENTS', 'EXPERIENCES', 'SEQUENCES', 'RESPONSES']","['trailers', 'clips', 'facial expression tracking', 'box office', 'emotion', 'success', 'responses']","['movies', 'comedy movies', 'facial expression tracking']",0.3333333333333333,0.14285714285714285

"In developing countries, weak institutional capacity to observe and regulate the economy discourages foreign capital inflows vital to venture investment. This informality effect may differ for migrant remittances, inflows less reliant on formal arrangements. We use institutional and transaction cost theories to propose that informality shifts migrant remittances toward venture funding. Analyses in 48 developing countries observed from 2001 to 2009 support our proposition. When the informal sector exceeds approximately 46% of GDP, remittances increase venture funding availability. Migrants and their remittances are vital to funding new businesses and entrepreneurially-led economic growth in developing countries where substantial informality deters other foreign investors.

"Research SummaryThis research addresses firms' use of external knowledge sources to develop patented inventions and explores the validity of patent citations as an indicator of interfirm knowledge flows. By comparing patent citations with primary data reported by the inventors, we uncover systematic measurement errors in patent citations and show that they depend on the firms' patent strategies (e.g., to reduce the risk of imitation or litigation), the source of knowledge employed (e.g., competitors, users), the technology of the underlying invention, and the institutional characteristics of the patent system. Our findings about the role of these factors in external knowledge sourcing and citing propensity highlight the importance of firms' strategic behavior and offer novel insights for the use of patent citations as an indicator of knowledge flows. Managerial SummaryFirms' open innovation strategies rely on the sourcing of knowledge from other organizations. Tracing these knowledge flows is difficult, such that the empirical research on this matter typically uses citations that patents make to prior art in order to track them. However, patent citations might be added also for reasons other than the actual transfer of knowledge. We use primary information from a large survey of inventors to assess the accuracy of patent citations to measure knowledge flows, and we find evidence of measurement errors that depend on the applicants' patent strategies, the type of knowledge sources used, the filing jurisdiction, and the technology of the underlying invention. We offer insights to evaluate the settings in which patent citations are a reliable measure of knowledge flows.","['external search strategy', 'knowledge flows', 'measurement error', 'patent citations', 'patent strategy', 'PRIOR ART', 'INNOVATION', 'SEARCH', 'SPILLOVERS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'INVENTORS', 'MOBILITY', 'OPENNESS', 'PARADOX', 'IMPACT']","['knowledge flows', 'measurement error', 'patent citations', 'prior art', 'innovation', 'search', 'inventors']","['knowledge', 'patent citations', 'interfirm knowledge flows', 'open innovation']",0.25,0.14285714285714285

"Many multinational corporations have implemented cross-national satisfaction measurement programs for tracking and benchmarking the satisfaction of their customers across their various markets. These companies measure satisfaction with the goal of maximizing customer loyalty and the financial benefits associated with loyalty. However, existing research comparing consumer satisfaction across nations is limited, with the few existing studies examining only a small number of countries or predictors of satisfaction, or a small group of consumers within a particular economic sector. To expand our knowledge of the determinants of cross-national variation in customer satisfaction, we study three sets of factors: cultural, socioeconomic and political-economic. We utilize a unique sample of cross-industry satisfaction data from 19 nations, including nearly 257,000 interviews of consumers. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that consumers in traditional societies have higher levels of satisfaction than those in secular-rational societies. Likewise, consumers in self-expressive societies have higher levels of customer satisfaction than those in societies with survival values. We also find that literacy rate, trade freedom, and business freedom have a positive effect on customer satisfaction while per capita gross domestic product has a negative effect on customer satisfaction. We discuss the implications of these findings for policy-makers, multinational corporations, and researchers.","['Customer satisfaction', 'International and crosscultural marketing', 'Multinational corporations', 'Economic freedom', 'ATTRIBUTE-LEVEL PERFORMANCE', 'PERCEIVED SERVICE QUALITY', 'CULTURAL DIFFERENCES', 'STOCK RETURNS', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'PROFITABILITY', 'INTENTIONS', 'FRAMEWORK', 'BEHAVIOR', 'IMPACT']","['customer satisfaction', 'multinational corporations']","['customer loyalty', 'determinants', 'researchers']",0.0,0.0
"Customer lifetime value (CLV) measurement is challenging as it requires forecasting customers' future purchases. Existing stochastic CLV models for this purpose generally make the following assumptions: I) purchase behavior of customers can be described by purchase frequency and the average monetary value of transactions, 2) customers keep the same purchase behavior pattern over time, 3) purchase frequency and monetary value are independent, and 4) customers are active during a limited period of time after which they permanently defect. We develop a new stochastic model that relaxes these four assumptions. First, in addition to the number of transactions and its monetary values, we also model purchase incidence decisions (i.e. whether or not to purchase). Second, our partially hidden Markov truncated-NBD-GG (PHM/TNBD-GG) model allows dynamic purchase patterns, dependence between purchase frequency and monetary value, and customers to become active after a few periods of temporary inactivity. Validation of our model on two datasets demonstrates that if assumptions 1 to 4 of existing stochastic models are violated our model produces more accurate forecasts of future customer behavior.

"Promotional games are used frequently in retail stores and online. While prior literature has focused on antecedents of promotional games, such as how individual differences induce game participation, little is known about post-winning decision making or its underlying processes. This study offers findings from seven studies to provide a detailed perspective on how promotional games increase consumer conversion rates and spending. The effect of winning a discount on conversion rates and spending is multiply determined and occurs via perceptions of luck and store affective attitude, and via perceptions of luck alone and store affective attitude alone. In order to get a more nuanced understanding of the underlying processes and to delineate theoretically driven boundary conditions for this novel effect, the authors subsequently analyze the two individual pathways through perceptions of luck and store affective attitude in isolation. Thereby, they contribute to the literature on pricing and promotions by providing a detailed understanding on how winning a promotional discount leads to a different set of consumer inferences relative to an equivalent straight discount, and to the literature on the role of luck in consumer behavior by providing a nuanced understanding of how luck operates in this common consumer context.","['luck', 'promotional game', 'discount', 'promotion', 'conversion rate', 'brand equity', 'SUPERSTITIOUS BELIEFS', 'PRICE DISCOUNTS', 'IMPACT', 'SELF', 'LUCK', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EQUITY', 'TRAIT', 'DEAL']","['luck', 'promotional game', 'discount', 'promotion', 'conversion rate', 'luck']","['promotional games', 'post winning decision making', 'conversion', 'luck', 'affective attitude']",0.2,0.16666666666666666

"Although innovation orientation has been documented as the primary strategy to support a firm's growth, imitation orientation, which represents an alternative strategic and cultural focus, has begun to receive attention. However, empirical evidence as to how each orientation is shaped by environmental turbulence and whether it is fruitful to adopt both orientations simultaneously is lacking. This study attempts to close such an important research gap by surveying 294 managers at 147 firms in China. Results indicate that dysfunctional competition and technological turbulence, two critical environmental forces in emerging economies, influence the extent to which a firm adopts these two strategic orientations. The results also suggest that firms should stay focused on one strategic orientation rather than both to optimize their performance outcomes.","['nan', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY', 'STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS', 'PRODUCT INNOVATION', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'EMERGING MARKET', 'CHINA', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'RESPONSIVENESS', 'EXPLOITATION']","['strategic orientations', 'china', 'environment']","['china', 'emerging economies']",0.5,0.3333333333333333
"Consumers set a lower consumption budget when they set individual calorie budgets for constituent categories (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks; categorical approach) versus when they set a total budget (overall approach). This contraction effect of unpacking a judgment is driven by motivated reasoning. Consumers are motivated to reduce calorie consumption, and this motive directs their cognitive elaboration for the budget decision to be on what to cut and how much to cut. Furthermore, the categorical (vs. overall) approach brings to mind more thoughts that are consistent with the motive to reduce consumption, which then leads to a lower calorie budget. Consistent with this explanation, the level of elaboration on reducing calorie intake-especially on occasions where over-consumption is less salient-mediates the contraction effect. In addition, the contraction effect is attenuated when the motive to reduce consumption is deactivated. Finally, while the contraction effect occurs when consumers have a motive to reduce consumption, the classic expansion effect of unpacking occurs when consumers are prompted to think about what to consume or are motivated to increase consumption. The results for calorie budgeting are shown to have downstream consequences on actual food consumption.","['budgeting approach', 'budget setting', 'unpacking effect', 'motivated reasoning', 'self-control', 'food consumption', 'TEMPTATION', 'PATTERNS', 'FAILURE', 'FUTURE', 'TIME', 'WANT']","['motivated reasoning', 'food consumption']","['unpacking', 'judgment']",0.0,0.0
"Research Summary; Integrating victimization into competitive dynamics and upper echelons theorizing, we develop and test theory articulating how rivals' perceptions of a CEO precipitate attacks on the CEO's firm. Rather than treating CEOs' characteristics solely as perpetrating action (a first-order effect, like research integrating upper echelons into competitive dynamics), we argue firms with CEOs possessing characteristics perceived as more submissive or more provocative are subject to more competitive actions directed toward their firms (a second-order effect, like victimization research). Empirical analyses of a sample of Fortune 500 CEOs supports our theorizing while interviews of executives corroborate our premise as well. Our framework offers a more complete and socialized understanding of CEOs' roles in competitive dynamics, providing both theoretical and practical insights as well as future research avenues. Managerial Summary: We articulate how CEOs possessing certain psychological, behavioral, and social characteristics may unknowingly precipitate competitive attacks on their firms. Our explanation integrates insights from victimology which explain how individuals are subject to more attacks if they possess characteristics others perceive as more submissive or more provocative. While prior research articulates that CEOs' characteristics affect decisions such as attacking rivals, integrating theories of victimization into this line of inquiry paints a more socialized view of why firms may be subject to competitive attacks as well.

"In this research we discuss the relationship between CEO and top management team (TMT) member compensation, and explore the implications of TMT pay for firm performance. Specifically we suggest that firm performance may benefit due to agency and group behavioral issues when top management team member pay is aligned-alignment is defined as the degree to which TMT member pay reflects (1) shareholder interests and (2) key political and strategic contingencies within the firm. In support of our theorizing, we found CEO pay to be related to TMT pay; TMT compensation, in turn, predicted performance (i.e., return on assets and Tobin's q) when aligned with shareholder interests and internal contingencies. Moreover, the effect of CEO pay on future firm performance was dependent on top team. pay.

"Service firms seek customers with high revenues, profits, or lifetime value. However, they frequently ignore variations in consumption that lead to cash flow variability and adversely influence service operations and financial performance. This study shows that variation in individual customers' consumption or spending on services can be decreased in ways that are actionable by most managers, without decreasing revenues or profits. First, customer satisfaction has a double-whammy effect: lower cash flow variability and higher cash flow levels. This finding is important because firms can increase satisfaction in many ways. Second, customers who participate in loyalty programs have more variable cash flows, but not higher average cash flows. Hence, firms should design loyalty programs to improve customer satisfaction or intangible benefits (e. g., membership recognition), rather than offering economic incentives. Third, customers who purchase many different offerings, or allocate a large share of their purchases to the firm, have higher cash flow variability and higher average cash flows. Firms can optimize the customer portfolio by combining customers with high variability with customers who have different, offsetting cash flow patterns. Fourth, personal characteristics, such as age and income, also influence cash flow variability. Empirical findings are robust across two settings: telecommunications and financial services. The study describes sensitivity analyses of how different service and relationship marketing strategies influence a firm's business outcomes. The article concludes with insights into how to integrate service management principles, which emphasize consistency or low variability in processes, with customer relationship management principles that emphasize growing relationships and cash flows.","['customer portfolio management', 'customer satisfaction', 'loyalty programs', 'cash flow variability', 'service management', 'customer lifetime value', 'relationship marketing', 'segmentation', 'SERVICE EXPERIENCES', 'RETENTION', 'IMPACT', 'SHARE', 'PROFITABILITY', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'FRAMEWORK', 'PROGRAMS', 'BEHAVIOR']","['customer satisfaction', 'loyalty programs', 'cash flow variability', 'service management', 'relationship marketing', 'share', 'programs']","['performance', 'customer satisfaction', 'loyalty programs']",0.6666666666666666,0.2857142857142857
"We investigate the role of domestic interfirm networks for the foreign divestment decisions of firms. We argue that firms' foreign operations risk being divested when a firm becomes more central in its domestic network. Positive changes in firm centrality at home facilitate access to information about new business opportunities, but they may also lead firms to consider reconfiguring their value chain activities and resources across locations. The resulting opportunity costs of maintaining foreign operations could subsequently lead to their divestment. Moreover, we argue that the positive association between an increase in firm centrality in the domestic network and foreign divestment is stronger under higher uncertainty, as pursuing new business opportunities at home becomes more appealing. We distinguish between firm-specific uncertainty and domestic market uncertainty. We test and get support for our hypotheses using foreign subsidiary data from U.S. firms in the ICT industry.","['foreign divestment', 'multinational firms', 'network theory', 'uncertainty', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'HOME COUNTRY NETWORKS', 'STRUCTURAL HOLES', 'COLLABORATION NETWORKS', 'DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION', 'ALLIANCE NETWORK', 'CORPORATE SCOPE', 'REAL OPTIONS', 'INNOVATION']","['foreign divestment', 'uncertainty']",[],0,0.0
"As advances in communication technologies have made organizations more easily connected to their workforce outside of normal work hours, there is increased concern that employees may experience heightened work-nonwork conflict when away from the office. The current study investigates the effects of electronic communication received during nonwork time using an experience sampling methodology to examine within-person relationships among elements of electronic communication (affective tone, time required), emotional responses (anger, happiness), and work-to-nonwork conflict in a sample of 341 working adults surveyed over a seven-day period. Hierarchical linear modeling results suggested that both affective tone and time required were associated with anger, but only affective tone was associated with happiness. Further, anger was associated with work-to-nonwork conflict and mediated the effects of affective tone and time required on work-to-nonwork conflict. Results also revealed cross-level moderating effects of abusive supervision and communication sender together, as well as segmentation preference.

"Research Summary: While research has focused primarily on stars as individual contributors, we examine organizational situations where stars must work closely with non-stars. We argue that, in such situations, building teamwork around a star is an exercise in learning under complexity. In response, organizations prioritize interactions involving the star to simplify learning. This simplification, however, creates organizational myopia. We claim that a star's temporary absence helps the organization overcome myopia by triggering a search for new routines. When he returns, the organization may combine these new routines with pre-absence routines to improve teamwork and performance. We exploit injuries to star players in the National Basketball Association as an exogenous shock and find that on average, teams perform better after a star's return than before his absence. Managerial Summary: This study examines the effect of the temporary absence of a star evidence that a star employee's temporary absence helps the organization overcome an over-reliance on the star and improve teamwork. Improved teamwork, in turn, enables the organization to perform better upon the star's return than it did prior to his absence. This result suggests that organizations might want to revisit the tendency to view stars as too valuable to lose, even for a short time. In particular, organizations may want to pull stars from ongoing projects and encourage them to attend professional development programs. A star's temporary absence and return from such a program improves not only the star's skills but also the organization's teamwork.","['human capital', 'organizational adaptation', 'organizational learning', 'organizational performance', 'routines', 'NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION', 'SOFTWARE SERVICES', 'MEMBER CHANGE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'ROUTINES', 'CAPABILITIES', 'FIRM', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'EXPLORATION', 'MICROFOUNDATIONS']","['routines', 'national basketball association', 'routines']","['stars', 'organizational myopia', 'routines', 'performance']",0.25,0.3333333333333333

"Research summary: The importance of firm-stakeholder relationships is gaining increasing attention. Although a theory of the drivers and consequences of stakeholder pressure has been developing, it focuses on pressures from organized stakeholders such as shareholders, NGOs, and activists, and does not incorporate the emerging possibility that individual voices may matter. By exploring corporate Twitter, which facilitates movement of individual stakeholders such as customers to a higher stakeholder class by providing them with a greater sense of power and urgency, we study the circumstances under which customer voices significantly affect analyst stock recommendations. We find that favorable reactions to firm-initiated messages matter, directly or indirectly, depending on the messages' growth implications. Customer-initiated negative messages have a significant impact only with high volume and formal institutions that support customer opinions.Managerial summary: Social media is increasingly used by firms for disclosing information and engaging stakeholders. Yet, we know little about whether and how social media usage matters. We show how corporate Twitter usage may influence analyst stock recommendations. Our interviews of securities analysts suggest that social media is not institutionalized yet, but increasingly used as a source of channel checks, especially for vibes, validations, and so on. Our analyses of corporate Twitter accounts show that both firm-initiated and customer-initiated tweets can have significant impact on analyst recommendations under certain conditions. For firm-initiated tweets, the extent of retweets is an important factor, along with the content of tweets, in particular, growth implications. For customer-initiated tweets, negative tweets matter, but only with high volume and regulatory structure that supports customer protection.

"Diversity among executives is widely assumed to influence a firm's strategic decision processes, but empirical research on this linkage has been virtually nonexistent. To partially fill the void we drew upon three separate studies to examine the impact of executive diversity on comprehensiveness of strategic decision-making and extensiveness of strategic planning. Contrary to common assumptions of researchers and executives, our results suggest that executive diversity inhibits rather than promotes comprehensive examinations of current opportunities and threats, and inhibits rather than promotes extensive long-range planning. In light of the cumulative research showing that firm performance is related to both comprehensiveness and extensiveness, our results provide evidence for an indirect connection between executive diversity and firm performance.

"Customers can sometimes learn unanticipated or hidden use value of a firm's product whereas the non-customers remain uninformed about that extra value. A monopolist will increase its profit by informing the non-customers of its product's hidden value. However, our analysis reveals that this may not be true when the firm faces competition in the market the firm may actually make a higher profit if it keeps its hidden value secret from its competitor's customers even if advertising to inform those customers is costless. This is because no advertising leads to information heterogeneity among consumers about the existence of the firm's hidden value, which gives an incentive for both firms to continue targeting their own existing customers rather than poaching each other's customers, alleviating price competition and increasing firms' profits. This beneficial strategic effect of keeping some product value secret from the competitor's customers can persist even when the firms anticipate the hidden value and compete more aggressively for customers in the early period. Our research suggests that firms can benefit from an under-promise and over deliver strategy if they refrain from communicating their extra value to the competitor's customers. Moreover, positive word of mouth about a firm's product will not necessarily benefit the firm and can in fact make all firms worse off. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"This research shows that making a precise (vs. round) offer in a negotiation may lead to diverging outcomes. On the one hand, past literature has demonstrated a precision advantage wherein offer precision reduces the amount by which offer recipients counter. On the other hand, building on the notion that round numbers symbolize completion and previous findings that individuals tend to set goals at round numbers, we hypothesize a roundness advantage wherein offer roundness increases the bargainer's willingness to accept an offer. Five studies provide convergent evidence for our proposition and reconcile the present results with previous findings. We found that participants receiving a round offer are more (less) likely to accept (counter) than those who receive comparable precise offers. However, if they counter, participants in the precise condition counter by a smaller amount than those in the round condition. Furthermore, in agreement with our explanation, we find that the roundness advantage is more likely to manifest when participants subscribe to the association between round numbers and the feeling of completion.","['negotiation', 'numerical cognition', 'round numbers', 'psychological closure', 'IMPLICIT ASSOCIATION TEST', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL CLOSURE', 'PRECISION', 'NUMBERS', 'INFERENCES', 'NEGOTIATIONS', 'RETRIEVAL', 'EMOTIONS', 'MEMORY']","['negotiation', 'round numbers', 'precision', 'numbers']",['goals'],0.0,0.0
"Using sales data from 30,008 books from Amazon.de, this article studies the effects of four distinct online communication practices that e-tailers increasingly use: presenting product networks (recommender systems), social features (electronic word of mouth and various types of user-generated content), free trials, and vivid content. These practices vary greatly in their effectiveness in influencing consumers' purchase decisions. The author also provides insights into the sales frequencies of popular versus niche products, in response to the selective use of these communication practices. Long-tail theory argues that consumers are particularly attracted to buying niche products, because these products match their personal preferences better than mainstream products do. In contrast, superstar theory predicts increased sales frequencies for popular goods. However, the results from this large sample reveal that both popular and niche products gain sales. The findings specify how different communication practices relatively and differentially affect sales of popular and niche products, which has notable implications for managers' selective uses of these tools.

"The meanings of brand and branding have been evolving over the past several decades. This evolution is converging on a new conceptual logic, which views brand in terms of collaborative, value co-creation activities of firms and all of their stakeholders and brand value in terms of the stakeholders' collectively perceived value-in-use. The authors argue that this new logic parallels and reflects the related, evolving service-dominant (S-D) logic in marketing. They provide an historical account of the branding literature, organize it into eras, and connect it to the evolution in marketing as captured by S-D logic. The analysis provides further support for the S-D logic of marketing and suggests a related research agenda for furthering the understanding of brand and branding. It also suggests that marketing managers might benefit from investing resources in building strong brand relationships with all of their stakeholders and a service-dominant firm philosophy built around brand value co-creation.","['Service-dominant logic', 'Goods-dominant logic', 'Branding', 'Brand creation', 'Brand evolution', 'Brand value', 'Brand logic', 'Co-creation of brands', 'Co-creation of value', 'CUSTOMER EQUITY', 'IMAGE MANAGEMENT', 'SELF-CONCEPT', 'COMMUNITY', 'CONSUMPTION', 'CONSUMERS', 'PRODUCT', 'STRATEGIES', 'BEHAVIOR', 'QUALITY']","['branding', 'brand value']","['value co creation', 'brand value']",0.5,0.5
"Purpose - The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of supply chain implementation issues on firm value. Design/methodology/approach - Using case study methodology, this paper outlines the cases of Hershey and Nike and the impact of supply chain implementation issues on these firms' value. Findings - Difficulties in the implementation of supply chain management software designed to maximize firm value, can result in a disruption of a firm's supply chain, causing losses for the firm and a decline in firm value; thereby creating much disappointment for the firm's shareholders. Hence, great care should be taken with the implementation of new SCM solutions. Research limitations/implications - Future research may be directed at extending this work by examining the changes in the market values of a wide sample of client and provider firms following the implementation of new supply chain solutions. Practical implications - When modifying a standard supply chain template to suit a customer's requirements, particular care should be used in implementation and provider firms should insist that clients follow the provider's implementation methodology. Complex SCM systems designed to track a multiplicity of product varieties, may lead to difficulties in implementation. Prior to switching to a new SCM system there should be adequate testing to see if the system meets the client's requirements. Premature switching can have disastrous consequences. Originality/value - This research demonstrates the impact of implementation issues on the effectiveness of SCM technology.","['supply chain management', 'companies', 'asset valuation', 'nan']",['supply chain management'],"['supply chain management', 'scm technology']",0.5,1.0
"This paper investigates the role of venture capitalists. We view their raison d'etre as their ability to reduce the cost of informational informational asymmetries. Our theoretical framework focuses on two major forms of asymmetric information: hidden information (leading to adverse selection) and hidden action (leading to moral hazard). Our theoretical analysis suggests Sour empirical predictions. 1. Venture capitalists operate in environments where their relative efficiency in selecting and monitoring investments gives them a comparative advantage over other investors. This suggests strong industry effects in venture capital in vestments. Venture capitalists should be prominent in industries where informational concerns are important, such as biotechnology, computer software, etc., rather than in routine start-ups such as restaurants, retail outlets, etc. The latter are risky, in that returns show high variance, but they are relatively easy to monitor by conventional financial intermediaries. 2. Within the class of projects where venture capitalists have an advantage, they will still prefer projects where monitoring and selection costs are relatively low or where the costs of informational asymmetry are less severe. Thus, within a given industry where venture capitalists would be expected to focus, we would also expect venture capitalists to favor firms with some track records over pure start-ups. To clarify the distinction between point I and point 2, note that point I stales that If we look across investors, we will see that venture capitalists will be more concentrated in areas characterized by significant informational asymmetry. Point 2 says that if we look across investment opportunities, venture capitalists will still favor those situations which provide better information (ns will all other investors). Thus venture capitalists perceive informational asymmetries as costly, but they perceive them as less costly than do other investors. 3. If informational asymmetries are important, then the ability of the venture capitalist to exit may be significantly affected. Ideally, venture capitalists will sell off their share in the venture after it goes public on a stock exchange. If; however, venture investments are made in situations where informational asymmetries are important, it may be difficult to sell shares in a public market where most investors are relatively uninformed This concern invokes two natural reactions. One is that many exits would take place through sales to informed investors, such as to other firms in the same industry or to the venture's own management or owners. A second reaction is that venture capitalists might try to acquire reputations Soi presenting good quality ventures in public offerings. Therefore, we might expect that the exits that occur in initial public offerings would be drawn from the better-performing ventures. 4. Finally, informational asymmetries suggest that owner-managers will perform best when they have a large stake in the venture. Therefore, we can expect entrepreneurial firms in which venture capitalists own a large share to perform less well than other ventures. This is moral hazard problem, as higher values of a venture capitalist's share reduce the incentives of the entrepreneur to provide effort. Nevertheless, it might still be bat in a given situation for the venture capitalist to take on a high ownership share, since this might be the only way of getting getting sufficient financial capital into the firm. However, we would still expect a negative correlation between the venture capital ownership share and firm performance. Our empirical examination of Canadian venture capital shows that these predictions are consistent with the data. In particular there are significant industry effects in the data, with venture capitalists having disproportionate representation in industries that are thought to have high levels of informational asymmetry. Secondly, venture capitalists favor later stage investment to start-lip investment. Third, most exit is through insider sales, particularly management buyouts, acquisitions by third parties, rather than IPOs. However, IPOs have higher returns than other forms of exit. In addition, the data exhibit the negative relationship between the extent of venture capital ownership and firm performance predicted by our analysis.

"Budget-related decisions in sponsored search auctions are recognized as a structured decision problem rather than a simple constraint. Budget planning over several coupled campaigns (e.g., substitution and complementarity) remains a challenging but important task for advertisers. In this paper, we propose a dynamic multicampaign budget planning approach using optimal control techniques, with consideration of the substitution relationship between advertising campaigns. A three-dimensional measure of substitution relationships between campaigns is presented, namely, the overlapping degree in terms of campaign contents, promotional periods, and target regions. We also study some desirable properties and possible solutions to our budget model. Computational simulations and experiments are conducted to evaluate our model using real-world data from practical campaigns in sponsored search auctions. Experimental results show that (1) our approach outperforms the baseline strategy that is commonly used in practice; (2) coupled campaigns with a higher overlapping degree in between reduce the optimal total budget level, then reduce the optimal payoff, and reach the budgeting cap earlier than those with a less overlapping degree; and (3) the advertising effort can be seriously weakened by ignoring the degree of overlapping between campaigns.","['Advertising campaigns', 'budget planning decision analysis', 'online advertising', 'operations research in marketing', 'optimal control', 'sponsored search', 'sponsored search auctions', 'OPTIMIZATION', 'MODELS', 'ADVERTISEMENTS', 'ALLOCATION']","['advertising campaigns', 'optimal control', 'sponsored search', 'sponsored search auctions']","['sponsored search auctions', 'substitution', 'complementarity']",0.3333333333333333,0.25

"Our study investigates why some firms engage in low international commitments such as exports in the early phases of internationalization, whereas others leapfrog the internationalization process and start with high international commitments in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI). Process models of internationalization propose that firms start with low commitment activities and gradually increase their commitments to international markets. However, recent empirical evidence has shown that many firms make high international commitments from the start. Our findings suggest that domestic resources and competitive action propensity affect early international commitments indirectly through domestic mindsets. A domestic mindset refers to the knowledge structures of the top management team prior to starting international activities, based on their managerial experience and learning in domestic markets. Our results suggest that knowledge and learning gained in domestic markets through diverse resource and competitive activities may be crucial in early international commitments.","['prior conditions', 'domestic mindsets', 'early internationalization', 'mode of entry', 'UNITED-STATES', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'OWNERSHIP PATTERNS', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'MENTAL MODELS', 'ENTRY MODE', 'PERFORMANCE']",['domestic mindsets'],"['international commitments', 'exports', 'internationalization', 'knowledge', 'top management team']",0.0,0.0

"Why are some serious cases of corporate irresponsibility collectively forgotten? Drawing on social memory studies, we examine how this collective forgetting process can occur. We propose that a major instance of corporate irresponsibility leads to the emergence of a stakeholder mnemonic community that shares a common recollection of the past incident. This community generates and then draws on mnemonic traces to sustain a collective memory of the past event over time. In addition to the natural entropic tendency to forget, collective memory is also undermined by instrumental forgetting work, which we conceptualize in this article. Forgetting work involves manipulating short-term conditions of the event, silencing vocal rememberers, and undermining collective mnemonic traces that sustain a version of the past. This process can result in a reconfigured collective memory and collective forgetting of corporate irresponsibility events.

"While a great deal of research has investigated strategies for increasing job seekers' initial attraction to organizations, far less is known about how job seekers respond to recruitment activities after application submission. We draw from signaling, uncertainty reduction, and uncertainty management theories to develop a conceptual model of the relationship between recruitment interactions (contact episodes) after application submission and organizational attraction. We test this model in three independent studies with data collected at multiple time periods. Study 1 employed a time-lagged research design with actual job seekers. Findings showed that justice perceptions associated with recruitment interactions influence attraction to an organization indirectly and directly via positive relational certainty (i.e., reduced uncertainty regarding how organizational relations might be upon entering the organization). Study 2 used a controlled experimental design to provide additional evidence of the relational certainty mechanism through which justice signals influence attraction. Finally, Study 3 incorporated a longitudinal (repeated-measures) design to examine reactions to recruitment interactions over ten weeks. Results indicated that the relationship between justice signals and organizational attraction via positive relational certainty is dynamic, suggesting that organizations should carefully manage their communications throughout the recruitment process.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE', 'APPLICANT REACTIONS', 'SELECTION PROCEDURES', 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE', 'MULTILEVEL MODELS', 'JOB-SATISFACTION', 'FAIRNESS', 'ATTRACTION', 'EMPLOYEE', 'INFORMATION']",['attraction'],"['uncertainty', 'uncertainty management', 'relational certainty']",0.0,0.0
"In this paper we integrate recent theories of motivation and leadership. Drawing on the self-regulatory focus theory and on self-concept based theories of leadership, we develop a conceptual framework proposing that leaders' chronic self-regulatory focus (promotion versus prevention), in conjunction with their values, influences their motivation to lead and, subsequently. their leadership behavior. We further suggest that leaders may influence the motivational self-regulatory foci of their followers, which will mediate different follower outcomes at the individual and group level.","['nan', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP', 'TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'CONTEXTUAL INFLUENCES', 'CULTURAL-VALUES', '5-FACTOR MODEL', 'PERSONALITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PREVENTION', 'PROMOTION']","['prevention', 'promotion']",['prevention'],1.0,0.5
"Research summary: This article investigates how corporate spinoffs affect managerial compensation. These deals are found to improve the alignment of spinoff firm managers' incentive compensation with stock market performance, especially among spinoff firm managers that used to be divisional managers of the spun-off subsidiary, and particularly when the spun-off subsidiary performs better than or is unrelated to its parent firm's remaining businesses. By contrast, incentive alignment does not improve for the parent firm managers running the divesting companies. This finding appears to be driven by a significant post-spinoff increase in these managers' incentive compensation, the magnitude of which is inversely related to governance quality in their firms. Together, these results elucidate how spinoffs influence managerial compensation in diversified firms and the companies they divest.Managerial summary: This article explores how spinoffs affect incentive alignment: the correlation between incentive compensation and stock market performance. The incentive alignment of spinoff firm managers improves following these deals. These gains are the largest when spinoff firm managers used to be divisional managers of the spun-off subsidiary and when the spun-off subsidiary performs better than or is unrelated to the other businesses in the parent firm. By contrast, incentive alignment does not improve for parent firm managers. Instead, the level of these managers' incentive compensation rises significantly post-spinoff, and the magnitude of this increase is inversely related to governance quality in these firms. Together, these results shed light on the ways in which spinoffs influence managerial compensation in diversified firms and in the companies they divest.

We found that teacher human capital that is specific to a setting and task, and some indicators of teacher social capital, predicted student performance improvement. At the team level, average educational attainment and horizontal tie strength were significant predictors of student improvement. We provide some evidence that team horizontal tie strength and density moderate the relationship between teacher ability and student performance.

"The paper investigates the agency argument that sales growth in pms with free cash flow (and without strong governance) is less profitable than safes growth for firms without free cash flow. It also tests whether strong governance conditions improve the performance of firms with free cash flow and/or limit the investments in unprofitable safes growth. Consistent with agency theory, firms with free cash flow gain less from safes growth than firms without free cash flow. But different governance conditions affect sales growth and performance in different ways. Having substantial management stock ownership mitigates the influence of free cash flow on performance, despite allowing higher sales growth. In contrast, outside blocks held by mutual funds reduce sales growth substantially, but does not increase performance from sales growth.

"Research in strategic management has shown that the timing of firm participation in a merger wave matters, as early movers have been shown to outperform later ones. However, while the consequences of the timing of action within a merger wave have been assessed, the causes that drive these timing effects remain unknown. We draw on the competitive dynamics perspective to investigate firm-level factors that influence the large-scale strategic behavior of leading or following within industry merger waves. We develop hypotheses based on the competitive dynamics argument that the awareness-motivation-capability of firms will influence the timing of competitive action. Consistent with this perspective, we show that a firm's strategic orientation, its structure, and its resource base influence the timing of firm entry in merger waves.

"Research in marketing has increasingly focused on building knowledge about how firms' marketing contributes to performance outcomes. A key precursor to accurately diagnosing the value firms' marketing creates is conceptualizing and operationalizing appropriate ways to assess performance outcomes. Yet, to date, there has been little conceptual development and no systematic examination of how researchers in marketing should conceptualize and measure the performance outcomes associated with firms' marketing. The authors develop a theory-based performance evaluation framework and examine the assessment of such performance outcomes in 998 empirical studies published in the top 15 marketing journals from 1981 through 2014. The results reveal a large number of different performance outcome measures used in prior empirical research that may be only weakly related to one another, making it difficult to synthesize findings across studies. In addition, the authors identify significant problems in how performance outcomes in marketing are commonly conceptualized and operationalized. They also reveal several theoretically and managerially important performance areas in which empirical knowledge of marketing's impact is limited or absent. Finally, they examine the implications of the results, provide actionable guidelines for researchers, and suggest a road map for systematically improving research practice in the future.","['marketing performance', 'outcome measures', 'conceptualization', 'operationalization', 'guidelines', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'BRAND EQUITY', 'BUSINESS', 'CAPABILITIES', 'FRAMEWORK', 'STRATEGY', 'IMPACT', 'SHARE']","['outcome measures', 'guidelines', 'framework', 'impact']","['research', 'marketing', 'performance']",0.0,0.0
"How do founding team members allocate task positions when launching new ventures? Answering this question is important because prior work shows both that founding team members often have correlated expertise, thus making task position allocation problematic; and initial occupants of task positions exert a lingering effect on venture outcomes. We draw on status characteristics theory to derive predictions on how co-founders' specific expertise cues and diffuse status cues drive initial task position allocation. We also examine the performance consequences ofmismatches between the task position and position occupant. Qualitative fieldwork, combinedwith a quasi-experimental simulation game and an experiment, provides causal tests of the conceptual framework. We find that co-founders whose diffuse status cues of gender (male), ethnicity (white), or achievement (occupational prestige or academic honors) indicated general ability were typical occupants of higher-ranked positions, such as chief executive officer role, within the founding team. In addition, specific expertise cues that indicated relevant ability predicted task position allocation. Founding teams created more financially valuable ventures when task position occupants' diffuse status cues were typical for the position; nonetheless position occupants with high diffuse status cues also appropriated more of the created value. Our results inform both entrepreneurship and status characteristics literature.","['nan', 'MANAGEMENT TEAMS', 'GENDER', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'DEMOGRAPHY', 'EXPERTISE', 'CONFLICT', 'NETWORKS', 'FUTURE', 'TIES']","['gender', 'expertise']","['performance', 'entrepreneurship']",0.0,0.0
"Although traditional and conjoint forms of concept testing play an important role in the new product development process, they largely ignore data quality issues, as evidenced by the traditional reliance on the percent Top-2-Box scores heuristic. The purpose of this research is to reconsider the design of concept testing from a measurement theory (generalizability theory) perspective and to use it to suggest some ways to improve the psychometric quality of concept testing. Generalizability theory is employed because it can account for the multiple facets of variation in concept testing, and it enables a concept test to be designed to provide a required level of accuracy for decision making in the most effective way, whether the purpose of measurement is to scale concepts or something else, such as to scale respondents. The paper identifies four types of sources-concept-related factors, response task factors, situational factors, and respondent factors-that can contribute to the observed variation in concept testing and develops six research propositions that summarize what is known or assumed about their contribution to observed score variance. Four secondary data sets from different concept testing contexts are then used to test the propositions. The results provide new insights into the design of concept tests and the psychometric quality of the concept testing data: (1) the concepts facet is not a major contributor to response variation; (2) of the response task factors, concept formulations are a trivial source of variance, but items are not always a trivial source of variance; (3) the situational factors that are investigated are trivial sources of variance; (4) respondents are always a major contributor to the total variation; (5) concepts by respondents are not always a major contributor and the other interactions are often not trivial; and (6) residual error is always a major source of variance. Additionally, the analyses of the secondary data sets enable some useful managerial conclusions to be drawn about the design of concept testing. First, the sample size needed to reliably scale concepts depends on the types of concepts being tested. Second, averaging over items provides considerably more reliable information than relying on a single item. Third, which specific item performs best is inconsistent and very context specific. The popular purchase intention item is never the best single item to use. Fourth, not much is gained by sampling levels of the response task factors. Finally, concept testing should be designed to meet the needs of specific managerial tasks.","['nan', 'GENERALIZABILITY THEORY', 'RELIABILITY', 'PURCHASE', 'SEGMENTATION', 'INTENTIONS', 'CONSUMERS', 'BEHAVIOR']","['generalizability theory', 'purchase']",['product development'],0.0,0.0
"CEO retirement represents the most common reason for executive succession in the United States and globally, with important implications for many stakeholders. Yet a comprehensive theory of late-career-stage executives-such as those approaching retirement-is absent from the management literature. Building on the literature on liminality, we develop theory centered on late-stage CEOs by conceptualizing executive retirement as a process that unfolds in three phases. In our framework we integrate upper echelons theory with regulatory focus theory to examine the relationship of promotion and prevention focus with the timing, pace, and nature of retiring executive role separation, transition, and reincorporation. We then construct four CEO ideal types-icon, custodian, balancer, and chairwarmer-which are based on configurations of the orthogonal dimensions of promotion and prevention focus, and by following each type along a unique pathway, we show how an integrated view of these dimensions leads to nuanced predictions. Finally, we highlight the dynamic nature of our model by investigating the role of two salient contextual factors-CEO age and past achievements-and show how they can alter retirement pathways. We discuss how a deeper understanding of executive retirement informs strategic leadership research.","['nan', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'HORIZON PROBLEM', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'RISK-TAKING', 'ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMISM', 'MANAGERIAL DISCRETION', 'SELF-DISCREPANCY', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'PROMOTION PRIDE', 'IDENTITY WORK']",['upper echelons'],"['ceo retirement', 'executive succession', 'ceos', 'upper echelons', 'regulatory focus theory', 'promotion and prevention', 'leadership research']",0.14285714285714285,1.0
Private equity (PE) has become an increasingly international phenomenon but there is a lack of research that looks at the process by which PE firms invest across borders. We aim to fill this gap in the literature by examining the role of institutional context and organizational learning as determinants of cross-border PE syndication. We examine these issues by studying the international expansion by later-stage UK PE investors into continental Europe over the period 1990 to 2006. Our results indicate that institutional context (in terms of the number of PE firms in the local environment and the presence of investment bankers in the local market) and organizational learning (in terms of the PE firm's experience in the host country; the PE firm's multinational experience; and the number of investment managers per portfolio company; but not the presence of local offices) are significantly related to the use of cross-border syndicates. Implications for theory and practice are suggested. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We test our hypotheses using an event study on a panel dataset of 217 firms based in 19 countries facing crises in 41 host countries.

"This manuscript delineates technological innovation into the separate dimensions of novelty and meaningfulness to examine how a firm's organizational learning modes of adaptive learning and experimental learning, together with unabsorbed slack resources, influence the effects of novelty and meaningfulness on firm financial performance. The multi-method empirical approach leverages secondary data from firm patent information and COMPUSTAT, and primary data from senior executives at 167 firms in various high-tech industries. The results indicate that adaptive learning heightens meaningfulness but diminishes novelty, whereas experimental learning harms meaningfulness. Additionally, firms' unabsorbed slack resources moderate the relationships of experimental and adaptive learning with novelty. In particular, experimental learning enhances novelty only when a firm has sufficient unabsorbed slack to adjust resource levels in accordance with experimentation. Further, the results suggest that meaningfulness increases firm financial performance as represented by Tobin's q, both independently and jointly when considered with novelty. These insights underscore the necessity of treating novelty and meaningfulness as separate dimensions of technological innovation that impact firm performance.","['Experimental learning', 'Adaptive learning', 'Slack resources', 'Innovation novelty', 'Innovation meaningfulness', 'Shareholder value', 'Organizational learning', 'Firm performance', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'PRODUCT PROGRAM INNOVATIVENESS', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'SLACK', 'CAPABILITIES', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'EXPLORATION', 'CREATIVITY']","['experimental learning', 'adaptive learning', 'slack resources', 'organizational learning', 'firm performance', 'slack']","['technological innovation', 'slack']",0.5,0.16666666666666666

"Not only are most franchisees themselves small businesses, but so are many franchisors, particularly in the formative years of their franchise businesses. High turbulence and attrition rates in the formative years of franchise businesses result in an industry profile whereby, at any one time, around half of all franchise systems are less than five years old with less than 10 outlets. The question arises: how do successful franchise organizations plan their human capital development in order to accomplish successful growth? An adjunct to this question is the role of franchisees who, while not totally independent in the sense of the conventional small business person, certainly do not see themselves as conventional employees either, and have certain expectations of participation in the process of which they are an integral part. This exploratory article uses case study material from a number of 'exemplar' franchise companies in the development of a resource-based view of organizational development. The article should hold considerable interest, not only for academics interested in franchising, but also for those examining fields such as small business strategic management, innovation and intangible asset growth.","['business format development', 'competitive advantage', 'franchising', 'growth', 'intangible assets', 'UK', 'SURVIVAL']","['franchising', 'growth']",[],0,0.0
"The authors employ a resource-based view perspective to understand how a set of capabilities (organizational learning, relationship, and quality capabilities) influences product strategy (product quality and product innovation) and export performance (relationship performance and economic performance). Using two types of respondents from the same firm, they find strong support for the capability-strategy-performance link. The results indicate that managers should invest in relationship management capabilities to improve product innovation and product quality, which in turn leads to export performance enhancement. Furthermore, the findings reveal that though product quality is a critical aspect in international markets, both product innovation and relationship performance play a greater role in enhancing economic performance.

"This paper presents a dynamic, firm-level study of the role of network resources in determining alliance formation. Such resources inhere not so much within the firm but reside in the interfirm networks in which firms are placed. Data from extensive fieldwork show that by influencing the extent to which firms have access to information about potential partners, such resources are an important catalyst for new alliances, especially because alliances entail considerable hazards. This study also assesses the importance of firms' capabilities with alliance formation and material resources as determinants of their alliance decisions. I test this dynamic framework and its hypotheses about the role of time-varying network resources and Jinn capabilities with comprehensive longitudinal multi-industry data on the formation of strategic alliances by a panel of firms between 1970 and 1989. The results confirm field observations that accumulated network resources arising from firm participation in the network of accumulated prior alliances are influential in firms' decisions to enter into new alliances. This study highlights the importance of network resources that firms derive from their embeddedness in networks for explaining their strategic behavior.

"The perspective in alliance research has shifted from the individual dyad to alliance portfolios; a key descriptor of a firm's alliance portfolio is diversity. Focusing on firms that are confronted with emerging technological fields, the authors examine the consequences of their alliance portfolio's technological diversity on superior product innovation. The literature has not been conclusive about the consequences of portfolio diversity. The authors examine the nature of the effect of portfolio diversity on superior product innovation and follow up on the call for a contingency perspectiveas not all firms benefit equally from portfolio diversity. The contingency perspective is based on the assertion that a firm's past strategies in internal knowledge creation are a source of experiences that increase the firm's capability to leverage extramural knowledge. Theoretically, the study thus contributes to the absorptive capacity literature that has recently acknowledged the importance of such higher-order internal capabilities. By identifying concrete dimensions of internal knowledge creation that enable firms to benefit from portfolio diversity, actionable recommendations are derived on how to align internal knowledge creation with external knowledge sourcing. The empirical support in the biopharmaceutical industry corroborates the developed theory and serves as a warning signal for firms that are ill prepared to leverage a diverse alliance portfolio.","['alliance portfolios', 'diversity', 'absorptive capacity', 'knowledge creation', 'superior product innovation', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'NETWORK STRUCTURE', 'HIGH-TECHNOLOGY', 'LOCAL SEARCH', 'IMPACT', 'CAPABILITIES', 'INNOVATION']","['alliance portfolios', 'diversity', 'absorptive capacity', 'knowledge creation', 'superior product innovation', 'absorptive capacity', 'capabilities', 'innovation']","['innovation', 'knowledge', 'absorptive capacity', 'capabilities']",0.75,0.375

"Purpose - The purpose of this technical viewpoint is to provide a commentary of how we went about using logistics prototyping as a method to engage citizens, science fiction (SF) writers and small-to medium-sized enterprises (SME's). Six urban logistic prototypes built on the themes of future cities, community resilience and urban supply chain management (SCM) are summarized, together with details of the data collection procedure and the methodological challenges encountered. Our investigation aimed to explore the potential of logistics prototyping to develop user-driven and SME approaches to future city design and urban supply chain decision-making. Design/methodology/approach - This Boston field experiment was a case study investigation conducted between May and August 2013. Qualitative data was collected using a mixed-method approach combining together focus groups (MIT faculty), scenarios, prototyping workshops, interviews and document analysis. These story-creators could use the prototype method as a way of testing their hypotheses, theories and constrained speculations with regard to specified future city and urban supply chain scenarios. Findings - This viewpoint suggests that the prototyping method allows for unique individual perspectives on future city planning and urban supply chain design. This work also attempts to demonstrate that prototyping can create sufficiently cogent environments for future city and urban SCM theories to be both detected and analysed therein. Although this is an experimental field of the SCM theory building, more conventional theories could also be tested in the same manner. Research limitations/implications - By embedding logistics prototyping within a mixed method approach, we might be criticized as constraining its capability to map out the future - that its potential to be flexible and imaginative are held back by the equal weighting given to the more conventional component. In basing our case study within one city then this might be seen as limiting the complexity of the empirical context however, the situation within different cities is inherently complex. Case studies also attract criticism on the grounds of not being representative; in this situation, they might be criticized as imperfect indicators of what transpires in other situations. However, this technical viewpoint suggests that in spite of its limitations, prototyping facilitates an imaginative and creative approach to theory generation and concept building. Practical implications - The methodology allows everyday citizens and SME's to develop user-driven foresight and planning scenarios with city strategists' and urban logistic designers. It facilitates much broader stakeholder involvement in city and urban supply chain policymaking, than current quantitative approaches. Social implications - Logistics fiction prototyping provides a democratic approach to future city planning and urban supply chain design. It involves collectively imagining socio-technical futures and second-order sociological effects through the writing of SF narratives or building design fictions. Originality/value - Decision-making in future cities and urban SCM is often a notable challenge, balancing the varying needs and claims of multiple stakeholders, while negotiating an acceptable trade-off between their competing claims. Engagement with stakeholders and active encouragement of stakeholder participation in the supply chain aspects of future cities is increasingly a feature of twenty-first century social decision-making. This viewpoint suggests that the prototyping method allows for unique individual perspectives on future city planning and urban supply chain design. This work also attempts to demonstrate that prototyping can create sufficiently cogent environments for future city and the urban SCM theories to be both detected and analysed therein. Although this is an experimental field of SCM theory building, more conventional theories could also be tested in the same manner.","['Innovation', 'Sustainability', 'Logistics', 'Operations strategy', 'Green supply chains', 'Operations planning', 'SCENARIOS', 'FORESIGHT']","['logistics', 'scenarios', 'foresight']","['small to medium sized enterprises', 'future cities community resilience', 'urban supply chain management', 'scm']",0.0,0.0

"Two separately developed views within the strategic management literature elucidate the source of a firm's competitive advantage based on the internal attributes of the firm: the resource-based view (Wernerfelt, 1984) and the distinctive competence view(Selznick, 1957). As developed in the literature, however, both views neglect important dimensions which inhibit the achievement of competitive advantage. These dimensions are resource weaknesses and distinctive inadequacies. Accounting for weaknesses and inadequacies exposes important choice-sets confronting management in making resource investments, and of time-related dimensions in developing sustainable advantage. Considering the effects of weaknesses and inadequacies provides insight on the limits to firm growth and to sustainability of competitive advantage.

"Innovation and the internationalization of business are two of the most important factors determining business success today. However, very few empirical studies have examined these factors together This study uses a discovery-oriented approach to examine innovation in the international marketplace. The study's findings are based on interviews with 64 senior executives including many current and former CEOs and presidents of multinational companies. The interviews were conducted in five countries over a period of several months. These findings provide insights into the thoughts of senior executives on innovation in international markets. Several novel insights that have implications far management practice and future academic research were discovered. Among these findings, executives stressed the importance of managing and disseminating knowledge throughout their companies during all stages of new product development. They highlighted several limitations in achieving this objective as well. Another finding is that firm adhere to several mechanisms that limit competition. In Japan, a well-recognised business hierarchy helps to form the market share goals of firms introducing new products. Companies in some categories seem to have art understanding that they will not introduce new products unless they are suitably differentiated from existing products. Other companies have bought our competitors to reduce competition. A third finding is that companies make concerted efforts to use standardized brand names and positioning, They find these efforts most suited to image-based products and children's products. Finally, the country-based management structures of most companies make it very difficult to cross-subsidize new products across countries.

"The extant lobbying literature largely focuses on the effects of firm aggregate lobbying expenditures, suggesting that more lobbying expenditures fuel positive firm benefits. We argue the focus on aggregate expenditures overlooks how expenditures are targeted and the influence of those targeting the expenditures; as such, exploring such factors will both add insight to our understanding of the theoretical mechanisms underlying lobbying and clarify contradictory findings. Specifically, we argue a successful lobbying strategy consists of both the breadth of government targeted and the political connectedness of the firm. Empirical results support our contentions that lobbying breadth and political connectedness affect the benefits firms receive from lobbying, which we operationalize both using government contracts and firm economic performance. Our analyses imply that more is not always better in the case of lobbying breadth, as the benefits accrued via dispersing lobbying across more governmental entities reaches a point of diminishing returns when lobbying breadth reaches high levels. Further, political connectedness has a moderating effect on the outcomes of lobbying breadth. We conclude the article with a discussion of the theoretical and practical relevance of this research and offer avenues forward for future research.","['nan', 'CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS', 'RESOURCE-ALLOCATION', 'SLACK RESOURCES', 'PANEL-DATA', 'PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETITION', 'STRATEGY', 'DIRECTORS', 'CONNECTIONS', 'VARIABLES']","['performance', 'strategy']","['political connectedness', 'economic performance']",0.0,0.0
"How do consumers manage goal conflicts before making a choice? This question was studied by examining emerging preferences in choices involving two products that were means to conflicting goals. These preference patterns revealed that an initially active goal, which had been set aside to reconcile a goal conflict, exerted greater than expected influence on the remainder of the choice process. This influence was manifest in a tendency for consumers to revert to the product aligned with the initially active goal upon seeing information that objectively favored neither product. The prevalence of the reversion (i.e., flip-flop) preference pattern suggests that activation of a set-aside goal escalates when it is set aside, much as if its pursuit had been impeded by an external force. In addition to revealing goal reversion in a variety of choice contexts, the studies in this article also find that goal reversion is moderated by goal conflict.","['nan', 'ACTIVATION', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'INTENTIONS', 'PURSUIT', 'WILL']","['activation', 'pursuit']",['information'],0.0,0.0
"In five studies, the authors examine the impact of an independent (vs. interdependent) mindset on consumer adoption of new products. Study 1 demonstrates that consumers in a predominantly independent (vs. interdependent) culture are more willing to adopt really new products, whereas consumers in a predominantly interdependent (vs. independent) culture are more willing to adopt incrementally new products. Studies 2 and 3 conceptually replicate these findings using situationally activated mindsets and demonstrate that this effect is driven by the perceived fit between the product's newness level and the optimal level of distinctiveness consumers want. Finally, Studies 4a and 4b show that the presence of distinctiveness-dampening cues (i.e., popularity cues) and distinctiveness-enhancing cues (i.e., scarcity cues) can reverse the effect of self-perspective such that the independent self becomes less willing to adopt really new products and more willing to adopt incrementally new products than does the interdependent self. These findings offer practical implications for managing innovation adoption in both domestic and international marketplaces.","['new product adoption', 'distinctiveness utility', 'self-construal', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY', 'NORTH-AMERICAN', 'PREFERENCE', 'INNOVATION', 'UNIQUENESS', 'RESPONSES', 'PIONEER', 'NEED']",['innovation'],"['adoption', 'products', 'mindsets', 'fit', 'distinctiveness', 'innovation']",0.16666666666666666,1.0
"Relationship management rapidly is becoming a central research paradigm in the marketing channels literature. A growing body of conceptual and empirical literature addresses different aspects of interfirm relationships, building in part on recent theoretical developments in organization theory, law, and economics. Interestingly, however, some of these theoretical frameworks make radically different assumptions about the nature of interfirm relationships, though these differences to date have not been examined systematically in the marketing literature. The author reviews these theoretical perspectives and develops a formal typology of approaches to relationship management. Specifically, he develops a typology of three different forms of governance, which vary systematically in terms of how specific interfirm processes are carried out. He also discusses the antecendents of different relationship forms and shows the results ot a preliminary empirical test.","['nan', 'INTERNAL POLITICAL-ECONOMY', 'ORGANIZATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'EXCHANGE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONTRACT', 'COSTS', 'POWER', 'FIRM', 'PERSPECTIVES']","['organization', 'firm', 'perspectives']",['governance'],0.0,0.0
"Despite the increasing use of gamification mechanics to engage customers in firms' activities, the risks related to such use remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, this research examines the impacts of losing a challenge, which is a phenomenon experienced by the majority of customers involved in gamified settings but underexplored in literature. We investigate the context of co-creation communities by combining two widely used gamification mechanics, competition and cooperation. Results from three laboratory experiments and one field experiment show that win/lose decisions weaken the benefits of gamification and, in the case of losing a competition, have negative impacts on customer experience and engagement. They also demonstrate that customers' levels of prior engagement with the community moderate the negative impacts of losing a competition. Supported by equity theory, this research questions the effectiveness of gamification mechanics, identifies their limits, and provides guidelines on how to properly implement them.

"The present research proposes that positive affect mitigates choice overload. Results from four studies show that whereas people in neutral affect feel less satisfied when choosing from a large relative to a small assortment, people in positive affect do not experience a decline in satisfaction and may even feel more satisfied when choosing from a large, relative to a small assortment. It is proposed that positive affect has these effects by shifting people's attention from the difficulty of the choice task to the quality of the assortment, as a basis for judgment of choice satisfaction.

"We argue that related diversification enhances performance only when it allows a business to obtain preferential access to strategic assets-those that are valuable, rare, imperfectly tradable, and costly to imitate. As the advantage this access affords will decay as a result of asset erosion and imitation by single business rivals, in the long run only competences that enable a firm to build new strategic assets more quickly and efficiently than competitors will allow it to sustain supernormal profits. Both short- and long-run advantages are conditional, however, on organizational structures that allow the firm's divisions to share existing strategic assets and to transfer the competence to build new ones efficiently.","['nan', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'ENTROPY MEASURE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGY', 'BARRIERS', 'FIRMS']",['performance'],['firm'],0.0,0.0
"In this research, we examine the role of brand equity as a strategy to offset the negative effects of a performance failure. Two independent studies. spanning four industries and involving 669 respondents are employed to investigate this issue. Results suggest that high brand equity leads to more favorable satisfaction evaluations and behavioral intentions than low brand equity. The brand equity effect is identified as a prevailing advantage that spans the entire failure and recovery sequence. This is an important finding because it implies that the advantages of high brand equity theoretically can apply to all failures, not just those for which recovery is attempted. Further inspection, however, reveals that despite the prevailing advantage. high-equity brand failures lead to a more drastic decline in customer evaluations immediately after the failure episode.

"Empirical evidence about the relation between organizational age and failure is mixed, and theoretical explanations are conflicting. We show that a simple model of organizational evolution can explain the main patterns of age dependence and reconcile the apparently conflicting theoretical predictions. In our framework, the predicted pattern of age dependence depends crucially on the quality of organizational performance immediately after founding and its subsequent evolution, which in turn depends on the intensity of competition. In developing our theory, we clarify issues of levels of analysis as well as the relations between organizational fitness, endowment, organizational capital, and the hazard of failure. We show that once organizational learning is considered, founding conditions affect the fate of organizations in ways more complex than previously acknowledged. We illustrate how the predictions of our theory can be tested empirically and evaluate the effect of aging on the mortality hazards of American microbreweries and brewpubs by estimating the parameters of a random walk with time-varying drift.

"We investigate cultural variations in the strategic issue labels of threats and opportunities. In a survey of 276 American and international respondents, we investigate the sensitivity of issue attributes that discriminate between threat and opportunity. We find that the cultural value of uncertainty avoidance (UA) had a significant effect: Compared to low UA cultures, individuals from high UA cultures were significantly more sensitive to controllability in perceiving strategic issues. However, other cultural value dimensions (individualism, masculinity, power distance) did not have similar effects. Our results point to the need to link specific cultural dimensions to specific aspects of strategic issue analysis.

"Purpose - This paper aims to seek to explain the influence of power asymmetry and the moderating role of an organization's absorptive and desorptive capacity on enhancing supply chain competence from its orientation to open innovation with its supply network. Design/methodology/approach - To perform this study, the authors use data collected from 262 European firms. They apply regression analysis to test the moderating role of an organization's absorptive and desorptive capacity on enhancing its supply chain competence from its orientation to open innovation. Findings - The results confirm both the influence of power asymmetry and absorptive capacity on obtaining benefits that derive from an organization's orientation to open innovation. The results do not, however, support the moderating effect of an organization's desorptive capacity. Subsequent analyses performed in the study show that organizations that achieve complementarity among their own absorptive capacity and the capacities of its supply network manage to obtain greater benefits from its orientation to open innovation.

"Although pay-for-performance's potential effect on employee performance is a compelling issue, understanding this dynamic has been constrained by narrow approaches to pay-for-performance conceptualization, measurement, and surrounding conditions. In response, we take a more nuanced perspective by integrating fundamental principles of economics and psychology to identify and incorporate employee characteristics, job characteristics, pay system characteristics, and pay system experience into a contingency model of the pay-for-performance-future performance relationship. We test the role that these four key contextual factors play in pay-for-performance effectiveness using 11,939 employees over a 5-year period. We find that merit and bonus pay, as well as their multiyear trends, are positively associated with future employee performance. Furthermore, our findings indicate that, contrary to what traditional economic perspectives would predict, bonus pay may have a stronger effect on future performance than merit pay. Our results also support a contingency approach to pay-for-performance's impact on future employee performance, as we find that merit pay and bonus pay can substitute for each other and that the strength of pay-for-performance's effect is a function of employee tenure, the pay-for-performance trend over time, and job type (presumably due to differences in the measurability of employee performance across jobs).","['pay-for-performance', 'merit pay', 'bonus pay', 'employee performance', 'contingency theory', 'pay trend', 'performance measurement', 'VOLUNTARY TURNOVER', 'MANAGERIAL COMPENSATION', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'SATISFACTION', 'AGENCY', 'WORK', 'FIRM', 'ORGANIZATION', 'MOTIVATION', 'ALLOCATION']","['pay for performance', 'merit pay', 'bonus pay', 'employee performance']","['characteristics job characteristics', 'jobs']",0.0,0.0
"Two key issues in business-to-business (B2B) sales force management are (1) how much a given sales job should be compensated (pay level) and (2) how much of the compensation should be fixed versus variable (pay structure). The authors examine the paychecks drawn by people in more than 14,000 selling jobs and more than 4000 sales management jobs in five B2B industry sectors in five European countries. They show that pay levels and structures reflect an apparent balancing of two conflicting pressures: the economic imperative (to reward better performers by heightening pay dispersion) and the compensation differential compression resulting from high tax regimes. In particular, B2B firms appear to use variable pay as a way to lessen the salary differential compression impact of high tax regimes on salesperson motivation. Furthermore, similar to chief executive officers, sales managers can have an important multiplier effect that justifies paying them at increasing rates as job challenge rises.","['compensation', 'motivation', 'agency theory', 'pay disparity', 'sales management', 'CEO COMPENSATION', 'REGRESSION', 'MATTER']","['compensation', 'motivation', 'sales management']","['sales force management', 'pay dispersion', 'compression']",0.0,0.0
"Purpose - This paper aims to examine the operating frontier, trajectory and absorptive capacity influencing proactive and reactive dimension of supply chain resilience and implementation in inter-organizational relationships. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a research model comprises six research hypotheses with five constructs, including trajectory, absorptive capacity, operating frontier, proactive and reactive dimension of supply chain resilience. The hypotheses are tested on data collected from 297 senior managers of Taiwanese manufacturing firms, using structural equation modeling. Findings - The study provides insights into how supply chain members can reinforce their operating frontier, trajectory and absorptive capacity activities to improve proactive and reactive dimension of supply chain resilience. Research limitations/implications - The resultant findings cannot be generalized for all forms of supply chains, as they exclusively reflect those in Taiwan. With the research model developed, cross-industrial studies on various forms of supply chains would be worth conducting to investigate whether their inter-relationship effects differ in relation to inter-organizational supply chain resilience. Practical implications - This study provides multiple insights for managers and practices seeking to improve inter-organizational supply chain resilience, which have become increasingly popular because their factors enhance coping strategies to achieve corporate goals. The proactive and reactive dimension of supply chain resilience can be effectively improved by enhancing trajectory, absorptive capacity and operating frontier. Originality/value - This empirical research attempted to fill the gaps created by trajectory and resource-based perspectives in inter-organizational supply chain resilience. This study reveals how supply chain members can reinforce the factors of their coping strategies (i.e. operating frontier, trajectory and absorptive capacity) to make significant improvements, which is not dealt with in previous studies.","['Structural equation model', 'Absorptive capacity', 'Supply chain resilience', 'Supply chain disruptions', 'Coping strategies', 'SCM framework', 'Operating frontier', 'Trajectory', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'DISRUPTIONS', 'RESPONSES', 'AMBIDEXTERITY', 'CAPABILITIES', 'VARIABLES', 'MODELS', 'IMPACT']","['structural equation model', 'absorptive capacity', 'supply chain resilience', 'coping strategies', 'operating frontier', 'trajectory', 'absorptive capacity']","['frontier', 'absorptive capacity', 'supply chain resilience']",0.6666666666666666,0.2857142857142857
"Purpose - There is a view that firms should decide between a lean or agile approach to supply management primarily on the basis of whether their product offering is functional (predictable demand, low variety and a long life cycle) or innovative (unpredictable demand, high variety and a short life cycle). This paper aims to present and test the proposition that this dichotomy is less useful in complex, one-off project environments, such as shipbuilding or construction, because projects typically require the assembly of many different, largely functional, products in a unique or innovative configuration. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports a case study focusing on one of the supply chains serving a major UK shipyard. The case study data were gathered by means of semi-structured face-to-face interviews with key personnel (procurement, sales, production, materials management and engineering/design) from each company within the defined supply chain. Findings - The case study reveals that the design and build process used in the shipyard introduces radical unpredictability into the demand for functional components of naval vessels. Originality/value - The paper raises important questions as to the conceptual robustness and the empirical generalisability of some of the extant literature on supply strategy selection. In particular, the case study suggests that a core assumption - that the demand for functional products is relatively predictable - is not sustainable in the context of project specific supply chains where the ultimate demand is generated by an active organisational buyer.","['supply', 'project management', 'corporate strategy', 'United Kingdom', 'manufacturing industries', 'shipbuilding industry', 'INTEGRATED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'CHAIN', 'AGILE']","['supply', 'chain', 'agile']",[],0,0.0

The variables most highly related to benefit level satisfaction were benefit administration, benefit comparisons (perceived inputs and outcomes of referent others) and employees' cost for the medical insurance premium (which was negatively related).

"The failure of many B2C companies has triggered widespread concern about the future prospects of such firms. Surviving and newly formed companies are reevaluating their strategies and struggling to build a sustainable business model. This paper empirically examines how customer value created through Web site interface and advertising affects firm performance in an electronic commerce context. Advertising can increase the number of visitors to a Web site. Web site features that facilitate presale, sale, and postsale tasks by increasing visitor-to-customer conversion can augment bottom-line performance measured in terms of economic value added (EVA). The results demonstrate that advertising spending alone has only a negligible impact on firm performance. A more appropriate profit-enhancing strategy for B2C companies is to complement advertising spending with a superior shopping experience that augments the value customers gain from the purchase experience. Advertising spending may act as a stimulus to increase Web site traffic. If complemented with Web site features that support customers' purchase-requirements determination and product-ownership experience, it can enhance the performance of B2C firms.","['advertising expenses', 'customer value', 'Economic Value Added (EVA)', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'INTERFACES', 'LOYALTY', 'ONLINE', 'SEARCH']","['customer value', 'economic value added eva ']","['customer', 'electronic commerce', 'value', 'impact']",0.0,0.0

However, research indicates much the opposite, creating a puzzle we attempt to answer. We argue that the stigma of dirty work fosters development of a strong occupational or workgroup culture, which fosters (1) ideological reframing, recalibrating, and refocusing and (2) selective social comparisons and differential weighting of outsiders' views.

"Prior studies on corporate political strategies have taken an exchange view to examine these strategies' benefits and costs for firms and politicians, but have paid less attention to how politicians' political values shape their perceptions of, and willingness to engage in, these exchanges. We investigate how politicians' imprinted political ideologies affect the likelihood of firms' political appointments. Examining 760 city mayors across 242 Chinese cities from 2001 to 2013, we find that cities have fewer private firms appointed to local councils if the mayor-the key decision maker for such appointments-is more strongly imprinted with an orthodox communist ideology that opposes capitalism. The intensity and evolution of such an ideological imprint are influenced by contextual factors. The imprint's strength is shaped by the mayors' prior exposure to intense ideological experiences, such as experiencing the Cultural Revolution at a young age. Working in an environment consistent with the ideology (e.g., a province with a greater communist legacy) sustains and even strengthens the imprint, whereas working in an environment inconsistent with the ideology (e.g., a city with greater economic development) attenuates it. We discuss the implications of these findings for political strategy research, imprinting theory, and nascent research on political ideology.","['nan', 'FOUNDING INSTITUTIONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONNECTIONS', 'STRATEGY', 'IMPACT', 'TIES', 'BUSINESS', 'ECONOMY', 'GROWTH', 'SOCIALIZATION']","['strategy', 'ties']","['political', 'political ideologies', 'communist ideology', 'imprinting theory']",0.0,0.0
"This research investigates the effect of temporal distance on how consumers see the future through their mind's eye. Drawing from construal-level and visual perception theories, we propose that shape (vs. color) is a high-level (vs. low-level) visual feature. Because construal of the distant (vs. near) future generally focuses on high-level (vs. low-level) features, when consumers visualize the distant (vs. near) future, they should engage in processing that captures shape (vs. color): namely, imagery that is relatively more black and white (vs. colorful). Experiment 1 establishes that shape is a constant focus of visualization regardless of the temporal distance of future events, whereas the focus on color decreases as temporal distance increases. Using image matching, image reconstruction, and behavioral response time measures, respectively, experiments 2A, 2B, 2C, 3, and 4 test and find that participants' visualization of the distant (vs. near) future is increasingly less colorful (i.e., more black and white). Experiment 5 establishes the underlying mechanism, showing that experimentally directing attention to high-level (vs. low-level) features directly promotes visualization that is less colorful (i.e., more black and white).

"Purpose - Although a lot of attention has been paid to demand information sharing in the recent decade, few studies look at the value of supply information sharing. The purpose of this paper is to address the importance of timely supply information sharing to the supply chain management under disruption is addressed. Design/methodology/approach - By introducing a Directed Acyclic Supply Network (DASN) model and an impact Network (INet) model, the impact of a disruption on the performance of the supply chain is quantified. A comprehensive algorithm is developed to calculate the time and cost impact of the disruption. Insights about the value of timely supply information sharing are further discussed, based on quantitative relationships of material flows. Finally, an application of the above model in a main manufacturer of China is introduced. It is then compared to its performance in the case of timely supply information sharing with cases where information is not shared or is shared late. Findings - By timely sharing of supply information, firms at downstream stages can alert a disruption at an upstream stage, derive the correct early warning time, and make proper decisions to offset the impact of the disruption. Information sharing therefore enhances the agility of firms while improving the stability and performance of the whole supply chain. Research limitations/implications - This paper only considers the time and cost impact from a single source of disruption. Further work may investigate other disruptions, which may arise from multiple sources. Practical implications - This paper provides an effective method to quantify the impact of a disruption. The method has been successfully applied in a supply chain management information system. Originality/value - This paper is among the initial studies of understanding and quantifying the value of supply information sharing.

"We explore a long-standing prediction in the international business literature that managers' subjective perceptions of political risk - not just the level of risk - are important for how firms manage political risk. The importance attributed to political risk by corporate executives has increased over the last 15 years and our results show that political risk is now considered more important than commodity (input) risk. Our analysis suggests that nearly 50% of firms avoid (not simply reduce) foreign direct investment because of political risk. Using a unique survey-based psychometric evaluation of manager risk aversion, we show that firms with risk averse executives are more likely to avoid investment in politically risky countries - a key implication of behavioral models. This relation is economically stronger when agency problems are more likely to be severe: for example, when executives are less aligned with shareholder value maximization, and when executives are younger (and therefore might put their personal career concerns in front of shareholders' interests). While numerous studies have shown that political risk affects foreign direct investment using objective measures of such risk (electoral uncertainty, conflicts, etc.), our study documents that executives' subjective perceptions of political risk are also important for political risk management.","['political risk', 'risk management', 'hedging', 'real options', 'cost of capital', 'derivatives', 'investment', 'foreign direct investment', 'risk aversion', 'behavioral theory', 'agency theory', 'economic growth', 'FDI', 'ISDA', 'GARP', 'survey method', 'probit model', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'INVESTMENT', 'POLICY', 'CORRUPTION', 'COMPENSATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'INCENTIVES', 'PERCEPTION']","['political risk', 'risk management', 'investment', 'foreign direct investment', 'risk aversion', 'uncertainty', 'investment', 'perception']","['political risk', 'firms', 'foreign direct investment', 'behavioral models', 'agency']",0.4,0.25
"Several manufacturers make substantial investments to compete in sports contests, using the gear they develop and market. However, no systematic analysis of the breeding (i.e., innovation) and branding (i.e., marketing) returns from such investments exists. In this study, the authors conceptualize and empirically estimate the breeding and branding returns that such manufacturers obtain. The authors gather data for 30 car brands of 16 manufacturers over the period 2000-2015 regarding their participation, spending, and performance in Formula One championships, annual patent citations, and research-and-development (R&D) budgets as well as monthly vehicle registrations, advertising expenditures, and Formula One TV viewership. The authors find that only gear manufacturers with relatively high levels of R&D spending obtain a positive and significant breeding return from competing in sports contests. While most brands obtain positive branding returns, the lower the level of advertising spending for the brand, the greater the branding returns they obtain from competing in these contests. Thus, research-intense (compared with advertising-intense) gear manufacturers have more to gain from competing in sports contests. These findings can help guide manufacturers in budget allocation decisions on sports competitions, R&D, and advertising.","['advertising spending', 'innovation performance', 'R&D spending', 'sales performance', 'sports competitions', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENTS', 'INNOVATION', 'SPONSORSHIP', 'IMPACT', 'EXPENDITURES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INVESTMENT', 'REPETITION', 'EXPOSURE']","['advertising spending', 'r d spending', 'sports competitions', 'research and development', 'innovation', 'expenditures', 'performance', 'investment']","['manufacturers', 'sports contests', 'innovation', 'branding', 'research and']",0.2,0.125

Using the multilevel structural equation modeling technique and data from 871 core-knowledge employees nested in 139 high-technology firms, we find support to our major hypotheses. Thgethel; this study finds support for the micro foundations' perspective and generates novel insights on how individual-level factors could be linked with firm-level heterogeneity in absorptive capacity. Managerial summary: We study how employees' characteristics contribute to a firm's absorptive capacity, that is, the ability of a firm to identify, assimilate, and exploit knowledge from the environment. Because firms have increasingly tapped into external resources to foster innovation over the past two decades, absorptive capacity is crucial to firm learning and success. Using data from 871 core-knowledge employees in 139 high-technology firms, we find that individual employees' learning goal orientation, the tendency to seek improvements in employees' competence and to understand or master new things advances the development of a firm's potential and realized absorptive capacity. More important, individual employees' civic virtue, the discretionary involvement in company issues, serves as a social integration mechanism that reduces the gap between firm potential and realized absorptive capacity.

"Integrating two disparate functions in organizations-marketing and information services (IS)-has become a critical business concern due to the increasing use of information technology (IT) to find and open new markets, deliver improved services to customers, and streamline internal marketing processes. This study appears to be the first to empirically examine the dynamics of bringing these distinct groups of specialists together. We investigate potential antecedents, consequences, and contingencies of IS-marketing integration, drawing on theories of complementarity and competence. Through a survey of IS and marketing executives, we learn that integration is facilitated by trust between the two functions and the interaction between IT strategic intent and customer orientation; it is impeded by a gap in top management knowledge of IT versus marketing. We also find that integration fosters the much-coveted capabilities of developing and introducing innovations (innovativeness) as well as responding flexibly, swiftly, and adroitly to opportunities (strategic responsiveness). Additionally, we determine integration is bounded by market dynamism. In sum, integration between marketing and IS can be enhanced via managerial efforts, and the relationship is profoundly beneficial to businesses.","['Marketing-IS functional integration', 'Innovativeness', 'Strategic responsiveness', 'Complementarity theory', 'Competence concept', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'STRATEGIC FLEXIBILITY', 'KNOWLEDGE CREATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CAPABILITIES', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'ORIENTATION', 'MANAGEMENT']","['innovativeness', 'strategic responsiveness', 'capabilities', 'technology', 'orientation', 'management']","['marketing integration', 'trust', 'customer']",0.0,0.0
"Bruce, Buck and Main (2005) offer two criticisms of agency theory as a valid model of executive behaviour. First, they suggest that because researchers have failed to find a strong empirical link between executive pay and firm performance, and since this research generally rests on models derived from agency theory, then we must question the theory. Second, they suggest that agency theory is under-socialized and therefore lacks generalizability to settings where social solutions would seem to eliminate the agency problem. In our response we make three points. First, agency theory rests on an assumption of self-interest that does not necessarily reflect opportunism. Second, agency theory does not make any reference to pay-performance sensitivity, and the failure of this research can be attributable to a variety of problems with the research. Third, we agree that agency theory does not explicitly recognize contextual factors, but suggest that this abstraction from context, gives agency theory greater generalizability, Finally, we review the UK and German contexts discussed by Bruce, Buck and Main to show that socialized solutions do not prevent the occurrence of agency problems.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL ECONOMICS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'DESIGN', 'RISK', 'FIRM', 'HAND', 'PAY']","['performance', 'firm', 'pay']","['agency', 'pay', 'firm performance', 'opportunism']",0.25,0.3333333333333333
"Development cycle time is the elapsed time from the beginning of idea generation to the moment that the new product is ready for market introduction. Market-entry timing is contingent upon the new product's cycle time. Only when the product is completed can a firm decide whether and when to enter the market to exploit the new product's window of opportunity. To determine the right moment of entry a firm needs to correctly balance the risks of premature entry and the missed opportunity of late entry. Proficient market-entry timing is therefore defined as the firm's ability to get the market-entry timing right (i.e., neither too early nor too late). The literature has produced divergent evidence with regard to the effects of development cycle time and proficiency in market-entry timing on new product profitability. To explain these disparities this study (1) explores the mediating roles of development costs and sales volume in the relationships among development cycle time, proficiency in market-entry timing, and new product profitability, respectively; and it (2) explores the moderating influence of product newness on the relationship between development cycle time and development costs and that of new product advantage on the link between proficiency in market-entry timing and sales volume. The results from a survey-based study of 72 manufacturers of industrial products in the Netherlands suggest that development costs mediate the relationship between development cycle time and new product profitability and that sales volume mediates the link between proficiency in market-entry timing and new product profitability. In addition, the findings indicate that new product advantage strengthens the positive relationship between proficiency in market-entry timing and sales volume. The results provide no evidence for a moderating effect of product newness. These results have important implications because to maximize new product profitability managers need to distinguish between costs and demand side effects of development cycle time and market-entry timing on new product profitability. Keeping this distinction in mind should help them to better determine the relative profit impact of investments in cycle time reduction or improved entry timing. Moreover, the findings suggest that highly advantaged products that enter the market at the right time may have a highly attenuated sales volume. It also implies that new products with lower advantage may have very little leeway in hitting the sweet spot in market. The message is that doing the right thing (i.e., to develop a highly advantaged new product) may be at least as important as correctly balancing the risks of premature entry and the missed opportunity of late entry.","['nan', 'SPEED-TO-MARKET', 'BUSINESS PERFORMANCE', 'UNITED-STATES', 'IMPACT', 'ADVANTAGE', 'ORDER', 'INNOVATIVENESS', 'INTEGRATION', 'STRATEGY', 'SUCCESS']","['impact', 'advantage']",[],0,0.0
"This study analyzes differential appointments by gender to the rank of named professorship based on a sample of 511 management professors. This sample represents approximately 90% of our original survey sample of faculty at Tier 1 American research universities, with 10 or more years of experience since receiving their PhD, and whose contact information we could obtain online. Contrary to the tenets of the meritocratic evaluation model, we find that, after controlling for research performance and other factors, women are less likely to be awarded named professorships, particularly when the endowed chair is awarded to an internal candidate. Furthermore, we find that women derive lower returns from their scholarly achievements when it comes to appointments to endowed chairs. Our study suggests that a masculine-gendered environment dominates management departments, leading to shifting standards when it comes to the highest senior appointments in academe.","['glass ceiling', 'academia', 'meritocracy', 'masculinities', 'DOUBLE STANDARDS', 'WOMEN', 'INEQUALITY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'CAREERS', 'RACE', 'MEN', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'EXPLANATIONS', 'STEREOTYPES']","['women', 'management', 'men']","['appointments', 'gender', 'management', 'performance', 'women']",0.4,0.6666666666666666

Study 1 investigated whether Hofstede's power distance scores moderated the effect of job autonomy on job satisfaction using World Values Survey data on 33 nations. Study 2 surveyed frontline hotel employees from Canada and PRC to investigate the moderating role of power distance at the individual level. In Study 3, hotel management students from Canada and PRC were asked to play the role of a frontline employee, who had to handle a special customer request, in a scenario experiment. These studies show consistently that the cultural value of power distance moderates the effect of empowerment on job satisfaction.

"Microblogging (e.g., Twitter) used in tandem with a mobile device as one integrated unit is rapidly emerging as the preferred choice for group communication among mobile users. To better understand this phenomenon and leverage its potential, more empirical studies are required. In this study, we empirically examine the saliencies of mobile conversations and user experiences of mobile microblogging via Twitter on a mobile device (TMD), in a comparative analysis including nonmobile online message boards (OMB) by using a participant pool of 423 business students. Mobile-mediated communication is presented as a subdomain of computer-mediated communication and used in describing TMD conversationality. The experiment revealed significant differences in the process-related messages, communication satisfaction, and perceived outcome of TMD small group communication compared to those of OMB. These results imply that Twitter mobile can be an effective group communication tool in an ad hoc dispersed small group setting.","['Communication affordances', 'microblogging', 'mobile communication', 'mobile-mediated communication', 'Twitter', 'COMMUNICATION', 'QUALITY', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONTEXT', 'MEDIA']","['microblogging', 'mobile mediated communication', 'twitter', 'communication', 'media']","['microblogging', 'twitter', 'online message boards', 'mobile mediated communication', 'computer mediated communication', 'communication satisfaction']",0.5,0.6

The meta-analysis reveals the following key insights: (1) SST usage is influenced in a complex fashion by numerous predictors that should be examined jointly; (2) ease of use and usefulness are key mediators, and studies ignoring them may underestimate the importance of some predictors; (3) several determinants of usefulness impact ease of use, and vice versa, thereby revealing crossover effects not previously revealed; and (4) the links leading up to SST acceptance in the proposed framework are moderated by SST type (transaction/self-help, kiosk/Internet, public/private, hedonic/utilitarian) and country culture (power distance, individualism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance).

"Research Summary: Inquiry into CSR as a human capital management tool has suggested that firms benefit from such activities because employees value the meaningfulness of these activities, which influences motivation and retention. We propose an alternate avenue through which firms can benefit from an important type of socially responsible activitypro bono servicesthat does not require that employees derive utility from the meaningfulness of the activity. We propose that pro bono activities can benefit firms through human capital learning and screening mechanisms, given the stretch roles that pro bono engagements allow. We formalize this argument in the legal services industry, where we provide primary evidence, a formal model, and empirical results using a panel dataset of the top 200 law firms to support this argument.

"The quest for a better understanding of how consumers' quality perceptions and satisfaction judgement contribute to ultimate purchase intentions continues to represent one of the key challenges facing service marketers. Using regression models the traditional approach is to employ direct measures of these constructs to identify the additive contributions of quality perceptions and satisfaction judgments as independent variables to consumers' stated future purchase intentions as a dependent variable. This study demonstrates that unobserved potential higher-order factors (and their interactions) in such efforts can lead to problems associated with interpreting regression coefficients as importance weights. A framework is proposed, and empirically validated in a multiindustry study, to assist service marketers in identifying potential higher-order factors and their interactions in their own models of consumer decision-making in service settings.

The findings suggest that there is a significant interaction effect of organizational culture with national culture on outcomes. Specifically, the relationships between the importance placed on the cultural values of stability, people orientation, and detail orientation and outcomes are significantly greater for Japanese than for U.S. service retailers. On the other hand, the relationships between the values of aggressiveness, innovation, and outcome orientation and outcomes are greater for U.S. retailers.

"How do bankruptcy laws as formal institutions affect entrepreneurship development around the world? Do entrepreneur-friendly bankruptcy laws encourage more entrepreneurship development at a societal level?

Amassing a cross-country database from 29 countries spanning 19 years (1990-2008), we find that lenient, entrepreneur-friendly bankruptcy laws are significantly correlated with the level of entrepreneurship development as measured by the rate of new firm entry.

We show how in the context of social movement activism, an effectual network pre-committed resources to an inchoate social enterprise to produce a material artefact because it embodied the moral values of network members. We develop a model of social enterprise emergence based on these findings. We theorize the role of material artefacts in effectuation theory and suggest that, in the case, the artefact served as a boundary object, present in multiple social words and triggering commitment from actors not governed by hierarchical arrangements.","['distributed agency', 'effectuation', 'longitudinal case study', 'material artefacts', 'social entrepreneurship', 'social movement', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'EFFECTUATION', 'CREATION', 'OBJECTS', 'LEGITIMACY', 'FRAMEWORK']","['distributed agency', 'effectuation', 'longitudinal case study', 'material artefacts', 'social movement', 'effectuation', 'creation', 'legitimacy']",['effectuation'],1.0,0.125

This theory focuses on the factors that determine users' trust in their researchers, including individual, interpersonal, organizational, interorganizational/interdepartmental, and project factors. The theory is tested in a sample of 779 users. Results indicate that the interpersonal factors are the most predictive of trust. Among these factors, perceived researcher integrity, willingness to reduce research uncertainty, confidentiality, expertise, tactfulness, sincerity, congeniality, and timeliness are most strongly associated with trust. Among the remaining factors, the formalization of the user's organization, the culture of the researcher's department or organization, the research organization's or department's power, and the extent to which the research is customized also affect trust.

"Our research utilizes revenue business-based relationships and data to expand the donor bases of non-profit organizations. Fundraisers desire to predict who will donate and how much to allocate their marketing resources effectively. To answer both questions, we develop the Spatial Tobit Type 2 (ST2) model that integrates the auto-Logistic (AL) and auto-Gaussian (AG) models into the Tobit type 2 framework. The AL component is used to predict who is likely to donate by inferring inter-client similarities based on the clients' transaction information from the revenue businesses. Similarly, the AG component is used to predict how much based on a similar measure of inter-client similarities. The Tobit type 2 framework combines both components into the single framework of ST2. Our empirical application linking a veterinary school's medical treatment records to its donation records demonstrates that clients' relationships built through their medical treatments at the school hospital positively contribute to their donation decisions.

"Academic entrepreneurship by means of university spin-offs commercializes technological breakthroughs, which may otherwise remain unexploited. However, many universities face difficulties in creating spin-offs. This article adopts a science-based design approach to connect scholarly research with the pragmatics of effectively creating university spin-offs. This approach serves to link the practice of university spin-off creation, via design principles, to the scholarly knowledge in this area. As such, science-based design promotes the interplay between emergent and deliberate design processes. This framework is used to develop a set of design principles that are practice based as well as grounded in the existing body of research on university spin-offs. A case-study of spin-off creation at a Dutch university illustrates the interplay between initial processes characterized by emergent design and the subsequent process that was more deliberate in nature. This case study also suggests there are two fundamentally different phases in building capacity for university spin-off creation. First, an infrastructure for spin-off creation (including a collaborative network of investors, managers and advisors) is developed that then enables support activities to individual spin-off ventures. This study concludes that to build and increase capacity for creating spin-offs, universities should do the following: (1) create university-wide awareness of entrepreneurship opportunities, stimulate the development of entrepreneurial ideas, and subsequently screen entrepreneurs and ideas by programs targeted at students and academic staff; (2) support start-up teams in composing and learning the right mix of venturing skills and knowledge by providing access to advice, coaching, and training; (3) help starters in obtaining access to resources and developing their social capital by creating a collaborative network organization of investors, managers, and advisors; (4) set clear and supportive rules and procedures that regulate the university spin-off process, enhance fair treatment of involved parties, and separate spin-off processes from academic research and teaching; and (5) shape a university culture that reinforces academic entrepreneurship by creating norms and exemplars that motivate entrepreneurial behavior. These and other results of this study illustrate how science-based design can connect scholarly research to the pragmatics of actually creating spin-offs in academic institutions.","['nan', 'TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'INSTITUTIONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'NETWORKS', 'STUDENTS', 'VENTURES', 'PRODUCT']","['entrepreneurship', 'knowledge', 'institutions', 'students', 'ventures']",[],0,0.0

We draw from 235 empirical samples of data (k = 235, N = 66,990) to conduct random-effects meta-analyses of interpersonal (k = 156, N = 42,239) and organizational (k = 206, N = 60,008) workplace deviance research so we can build the solid foundation necessary to advance the conversation in this literature. We use an exploratory meta-analytic approach and the horizontal contrasting method of theory elaboration to provide a nuanced understanding of the relationship between interpersonal and organizational deviance (rho = .67, k = 110, N = 30,426) as well as determine the magnitude and generalizability (i.e., external validity) of relationships within their nomological networks. We find some evidence of differences (i.e., heterogeneity) in the measurement and magnitude of relationships across contexts. Overall, we conduct a state-of-the-art meta-analysis that leverages contemporary meta-analytic techniques and the extensive body of empirical workplace deviance research available to improve our understanding of the measurement of workplace deviance and relationships within its nomological network. Our study instigates new debates about the completeness of our understanding of workplace deviance and provides the empirical building blocks necessary for this literature to reach its unrealized potential.","['deviance', 'meta-analysis', 'counterproductive work behavior', 'CWB', 'ABUSIVE SUPERVISION', 'JUDGMENT CALLS', 'EFFECT SIZES', 'BEHAVIOR', 'MANAGEMENT', 'SCIENCE', 'TRANSPARENCY', 'RELIABILITY', 'EMPLOYEES', 'AUTONOMY']","['deviance', 'meta analysis']","['workplace deviance', 'networks', 'meta analysis']",0.3333333333333333,0.5
"Firms may allocate scarce resources to two fundamental strategic processes: value creation and value appropriation. The relative investment in these processes (i.e., a firm's relative strategic emphasis) may be associated with firm-idiosyncratic risk. Empirically, a firm's relative strategic emphasis is represented by the difference between its advertising expenditure and its research-and-development expenditure. Using data from 2,403 firms over the period of 2000-2014, the authors find that firms' relative strategic emphasis on value appropriation versus value creation reduces firm risk, though in a contingent manner. This association is weaker when firms have larger positive or negative relative performance. Furthermore, these contingent associations are stronger when demand instability in an industry is higher. Overall, the results demonstrate that a firm's strategic emphasis should be examined in light of its relative performance, as well as in the context of current market conditions, when making judicious resource allocation decisions.","['firm-idiosyncratic risk', 'relative strategic emphasis', 'relative performance', 'demand instability', 'financial metrics', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'HIGH-TECHNOLOGY MARKETS', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'STOCK-MARKET', 'SHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES', 'ORGANIZATIONAL ASPIRATIONS', 'PROSPECT-THEORY', 'VALUE CREATION', 'CAUSAL MODEL']","['firm idiosyncratic risk', 'relative strategic emphasis', 'relative performance', 'demand instability', 'research and development', 'value creation']","['firms', 'value', 'research and development', 'risk', 'performance']",0.2,0.16666666666666666
"Recent research on management innovation, i.e. new managerial processes, practices, or structures that change the nature of managerial work, suggests it can be an important source of competitive advantage. In this study, we focus on management innovation at the organization level and investigate the role of leadership behaviour as a key antecedent. Due to its prominent role within organizations, top management has the ability to greatly influence management innovation. In particular, we focus on leadership behaviour and examine transformational and transactional leadership. Additionally, as contextual variables like organizational size may influence the impact of leadership, we investigate its moderating role. Findings show that both leadership behaviours contribute to management innovation. Interestingly, our study indicates that smaller, less complex, organizations benefit more from transactional leadership in realizing management innovation. On the other hand, larger organizations need to draw on transformational leaders to compensate for their complexity and allow management innovation to flourish.","['innovation', 'management innovation', 'organizational size', 'transactional leadership', 'transformational leadership', 'CONTINGENT REWARD LEADERSHIP', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'TOP-MANAGEMENT', 'TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE', 'EXPLORATORY INNOVATION', 'UNIT PERFORMANCE', 'MULTIPLE-LEVELS', 'TEAM', 'BEHAVIOR']","['innovation', 'management innovation', 'organizational size', 'transactional leadership', 'top management', 'transactional leadership']","['management innovation', 'transactional leadership']",1.0,0.3333333333333333
"The emergence of organized civil society and of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as organizational manifestations of broader social movements has dramatically altered the global political-economic landscape. The increasing global reach of NGOs challenges established international business (IB) research, and highlights opportunities for broadening and adapting extant paradigms in the field. In this article, we introduce the concept of NGOs and contrast them with their private-sector ( firm) and public-sector ( government) counterparts within the context of IB. We discuss factors giving rise to NGOs as important organizational entities that participate in global value creation and governance, and identify limits to their efficacy and viability. We identify important questions raised by incorporating NGOs into our conceptualization of global context, and we challenge three basic tenets of IB theory: the definition and dynamics of an institutional field, the relevance/centrality of a firm-government (i.e., two-sector) bargaining model, and the pre-eminence of the firm as the global organization of interest within the field. We conclude by offering suggested research directions that should serve as catalysts for this new and potentially rich area of future IB research.","['NGO', 'nongovernmental organization', 'civil society', 'ECLECTIC PARADIGM', 'CIVIL-SOCIETY', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'STRATEGY', 'POWER', 'GLOBALIZATION', 'POLITICS', 'TRADE', 'ACCOUNTABILITY', 'INFORMATION']","['ngo', 'nongovernmental organization', 'civil society', 'civil society']",['organizations ngos'],0.0,0.0
"Building upon the perspective that narcissism is a leadership trait with both 'bright' and 'dark' sides, the present study examines the question of whether companies led by narcissistic CEOs exhibit higher levels of entrepreneurial orientation (EO). Moreover, this research examines whether EO partially explains why narcissistic CEO-led firms experience greater variability in firm performance. Using survey data collected from 173 CEOs, and an archival measure of firm performance variance, we find support for our model. These findings offer an improved understanding of how CEO narcissism influences performance variance, and why the firms they lead may even, at times, be viewed as on a path to success.

"The present study examines both positive and negative norms of reciprocity in managerial work relationships by assessing three components of reciprocal behavior: immediacy, equivalence, and interest motive. The findings show that subordinate reports of immediacy, equivalence, and self-interest were negatively associated, and mutual-interest was positively associated, with relationship quality as reported by both subordinates and managers (other-interest was not significant). These components of reciprocity were also subjected to cluster analysis to identify groupings of reciprocity styles. The results indicate styles reflecting high quality (n = 65), low quality (n = 120), and negative social exchanges (n = 23). Analyses addressing reciprocity configurations and work outcomes showed that the higher quality exchange relationships had higher levels of perceived organizational support and altruism (but not commitment) than the lower and negative exchange groups, while only the negative reciprocity group showed lower levels of performance and conscientiousness as rated by the manager (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

"Outsourcing in many industries has advanced beyond simple component supply to encompass manufacturing of entire products, often by suppliers in emerging economies. Understanding the evolving role and capabilities of suppliers in global supply chains is thus a pressing strategic issue for suppliers and customers alike. We analyze a novel panel dataset of supply relationships in the mobile telecommunications industry to answer the following questions: What factors contribute to a supplier's ability to build technological and market capabilities? Does it matter to whom the firm supplies? Is involvement in product design important, or is manufacturing the key to learning? Do the same types of relationships that support technological innovation also facilitate successful introduction of own-brand products, or does this require a different locus of learning?

"Several generally untested assumptions about strategic judgment and choice exist in strategic management theories. Direct examination of these assumptions is necessary for sound theory building, and for sound prescription based on current theory. This paper presents techniques for eliciting and analyzing the strategic judgments of strategy makers, and discusses the potential of these techniques for increasing the internal validity and practical relevance of strategy research. We argue that incorporating managerial judgment more directly into the mainstream of strategy research will lead to both new theory and the extension of existing theory.","['STRATEGIC JUDGMENT', 'DECISION ANALYSIS', 'RESEARCH METHODS', 'TOP MANAGERS', 'CONTINGENCY THEORY', 'TOP MANAGERS', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'CHOICE', 'TEAM', 'ORGANIZATION', 'DETERMINISM', 'COGNITION', 'MODELS']","['strategic judgment', 'choice']",[],0,0.0
"The fundamental dynamics of virtual and traditional face-to-face teams may be very different. The purpose of this study is to empirically examine and assess the moderating effects of virtuality on the antecedents and outcome of trust, where virtuality is measured along a continuum from face to face (no virtuality) to fully virtual rather than the more common approach of dichotomizing teams into two groups (i.e., face to face and virtual). The sample includes 116 different new product development teams from a variety of industries. The antecedents of trust that are studied are familiarity, goal clarity, training, relationship conflict, and process conflict. The outcome of trust is analyzed by determining how the impact of trust on cooperation changes as the level of virtuality changes. Primary findings are as follows: (1) Relationship conflict can be more detrimental to virtual teams than face-to-face teams because it is very difficult for team members of virtual teams to resolve their interpersonal disputes; (2) goal clarity is more important for face-to-face teams and less important for virtual teams in creating trust among team members; and (3) the impact of trust on cooperation is less for virtual teams than face-to-face teams. The primary implication for researchers and practice of these findings is that the role and importance of trust in virtual teams needs to be reevaluated. Managers using virtual teams need to realize that interpersonal relationships in virtual teams do not evolve in the same manner as face-to-face teams and may require different management techniques to be successful.","['nan', 'FACE-TO-FACE', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'DISTRIBUTED TEAMS', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'CONFLICT', 'MODEL', 'DISTRUST', 'COMMUNICATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONTEXT']","['face to face', 'conflict']","['goal clarity', 'conflict', 'cooperation']",0.3333333333333333,0.5
"Time is a resource. As such, consumers have to make decisions regarding their use of time in the purchase and consumption of goods and services. Using prospect theory and mental accounting as theoretical frameworks, this article investigates whether consumers treat time like money when they make decisions. In a series of studies, we found that the value of consumers' time is not constant but depends on contextual characteristics of the decision situation. Our results also suggest that in deterministic situations, people make decisions involving time losses in a manner consistent with the convex loss function proposed by prospect theory. However, in decision making under conditions of risk, people seem to make risk-averse choices with respect to decisions in the domain of time in contrast to the risk-seeking behavior often found with respect to decisions involving losses of money. We discuss the nonfungibility of time as an explanation for the discrepancy between decisions involving time and those involving money.","['nan', 'RISKY CHOICE', 'PREFERENCES', 'BEHAVIOR']",['behavior'],[],0,0.0
"In this article I examine political lobbying and investigate firms' decisions to employ internal functionalities (i.e., to make or insource), to contract with external professionals (i.e., to buy or outsource), or to do both (i.e., to make and buy or plural source). I first develop an integrated framework based on the twin perspectives of economic efficiency and legitimacy. When the political audience faces little uncertainty about lobbying content, firms make sourcing decisions to maximize economic efficiency in producing such content in line with transaction cost economics and the capabilities view. However, when the political audience faces substantial uncertainty about lobbying content, it relies on the perceived legitimacy of the lobbying entity to draw inferences about the quality of such content; therefore, the legitimacy of a potential lobbying entity matters to firms making sourcing decisions related to lobbying. I then connect firms' sourcing decisions with several concrete characteristics of lobbying entities that can affect political audiences' judgment regarding their legitimacy. Finally, I examine the tension that develops when legitimacy and economic efficiency considerations call for different forms of sourcing, as well as how complementarities in plural sourcing help resolve this tension in certain situations.","['nan', 'FIRM', 'STRATEGY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'REPUTATION', 'PARTICIPATION', 'ORGANIZATION', 'GOVERNANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'BENEFITS', 'MARKET']",['firm'],['political lobbying'],0.0,0.0
"Factors that affect a firm's ability to achieve an advantage may differ from those that affect its ability to sustain that advantage. Moreover, if advantage is a relative concept then studies that relate resource stocks to absolute' outcomes say little about how resources contribute to enduring differences among firms. We explore these issues in the global semiconductor industry by analyzing how a firm's resource stocks contribute to the persistence of an innovation advantage (a relative outcome). The findings demonstrate that a firm's own production experience and the experience held by its partners contribute to temporary innovation advantages. The results also show that a firm's own production experience yields a more durable innovation advantage as compared to the experience held by a firm's partners and that the experience held by a firm's partners provides a more enduring advantage than a firm's patent stock.","['innovation', 'persistence', 'resource stocks', 'superior profits', 'temporary advantage', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'SUSTAINED COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION', 'TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION', 'INDUSTRY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FIRM', 'INTERFIRM', 'PROFITS']","['innovation', 'persistence', 'resource stocks', 'industry', 'firm']","['innovation', 'innovation advantages']",0.5,0.2

"This research investigates the effect of activation of a negative stereotype on behaviors that are perceived to increase the chance of becoming a member of the stereotyped group. Activation of a negative stereotype (the overweight stereotype) is shown to lead to stereotype-consistent goal commitment (low health goal commitment), which partially explains increases in stereotype-conducive behavior (eating indulgent foods). Two theoretically relevant moderators are proposed and supported. Increased accessibility of the countervailing health goal and increased accessibility of the link between the behavior and membership in the stereotyped group both limit the effect of stereotype activation on stereotype-conducive behavior. Five experiments support the facilitative effect of stereotype activation on stereotype-conducive behavior, the role of goal commitment, and both moderators.","['nan', 'PERCEPTION', 'PREJUDICE', 'WEIGHT', 'WILL']",['weight'],[],0,0.0
"This study places important boundary conditions on the generally accepted notion that CSR will reduce turnover. Our primary argument is that CSR will be most effective at reducing turnover that is motivated by a preference for more meaningfulness at work. We find empirical support for this idea using microdata on attorneys employed by large law firms. We find that firms with higher levels of CSR have moderately lower rates of turnover to startup law firms and turnover through occupation changes, moves which are more likely to be motivated by a preference for meaningfulness than moves to nonstartup law firms. Strikingly, the retention benefits of CSR are much stronger after attorneys experience mortality-related shocks that likely cause them to reevaluate their jobs (i.e., for New York City-born attorneys following the 9/11 terror attacks). To our surprise, we also find that firms with higher levels of CSR experience higher turnover rates to nonstartup law firms. In addition to our arguments about the importance of meaningfulness, the study provides two important extensions to work examining CSR and turnover: (1) it may be useful to view the CSR-turnover relationship through a risk-management lens, and (2) investments in CSR may increase employee departures from organizations under certain conditions.","['nan', 'VALLEY LAW FIRMS', 'MORTALITY SALIENCE', 'UNFOLDING MODEL', 'PERSON-ORGANIZATION', 'VOLUNTARY TURNOVER', 'PRO BONO', 'WORK', 'JOB', 'PERFORMANCE', 'GENERATIVITY']","['work', 'job']","['csr', 'turnover', 'law firms', 'risk management']",0.0,0.0
"The issue of the failure of incumbent firms in the face of radical technical change has been a central question in the technology strategy domain for some time. We add to prior contributions by highlighting the role a firm's existing set of complementary assets have in influencing its investment in alternative technological trajectories. We develop an analytical model that considers firm heterogeneity with respect to both technological trajectories and complementary assets. Complementary assets play a dual role in incumbents' investment behavior toward radical technological change: they are not only resources (pipes) that can buffer firms from technology change, but also prisms through which firms view those changes, influencing both the magnitude of resources that should be invested and the trajectory to which these resources should be directed.

"Building upon the culturally endorsed implicit theory of leadership, we investigated the moderating effects of national culture on the relationship between organizational structure and continuous improvement and learning. We propose that the relationship between organic organizations (characterized by flat, decentralized structures with a wide use of multifunctional employees) and continuous improvement and learning will be stronger when national cultural endorsement for participative leadership is high. We further propose that organizational group culture will moderate the relationship between organizational structure and continuous improvement and learning, but that these moderation effects will be stronger in national cultures with low endorsement of participative leadership. Empirical analysis of secondary survey data collected from 266 manufacturing plants operating in three industries and located in nine countries representing a diverse set of geographical regions provided support for the hypotheses. Overall, our findings indicate that, to fully realize the relationship between organic structures and continuous improvement and learning, managers must actively assess the extent to which the national culture endorses participative leadership. In cases where this endorsement is weak, managers should consider the extent to which the organizational culture will provide alternative support for the relationship.

"Previous research on (grocery) shopping trips has focused on studying the relationship between shopping frequency and shopper's demographic characteristics. Recognizing that shoppers are heterogeneous in terms of their shopping trip regularity as well as shopping frequency, we propose a mixture model of the exponential and the Erlang-2 distribution with heterogeneous frequency for shopping trip intervals. Applied to IRI (Information Resources, inc.) shopping trip data, we found that 70 percent of shoppers visit grocery st6res with random intervals and 30 percent with relatively fixed intervals. We also found clear differences between these random and routine shoppers in terms of several demographic and purchase behavioral characteristics. The routine shoppers are identified to have higher opportunity costs which make it difficult for them to visit grocery stores more often and/or to switch stores. However, they spend more dollars for a given shopping trip. Finally, we discuss managerial iniplications of segmenting shoppers by their shopping trip regularity.","['nan', 'MODEL', 'CHOICE', 'FREQUENCY']","['model', 'frequency']","['grocery shopping trips', 'frequency', 'opportunity costs']",0.3333333333333333,0.5

"We test hypotheses derived from resource dependence and sensemaking/sensegiving theoretical lenses in the context of CEO succession, focusing on an under-researched yet prevalent type of executive turnover - CEO retirement. Using event study methodology and a sample of CEO retirements from S&P 1500 firms during the 2003-12 period, we find that, all else equal, shareholders' perceptions of organizations' capacity to serve their interests are adversely affected when a retirement related change occurs in the leadership structure. Specifically, in line with resource dependence theory, we find that CEO retirement disclosures typically generate negative abnormal returns. Furthermore, in line with the sensemaking perspective, we find that the magnitude of shareholders' reactions is contingent on the lexical sensegiving cues contained in the organizational narratives that are released to capital markets via executive retirement announcements. Overall, our theory and results point to CEO retirement events as consequential in the eyes of shareholders, challenging an important assumption of extant succession research. Moreover, they suggest that shareholders' interpretation of these events is influenced by organizational sensegiving, highlighting the important role of organizational communication around succession events.","['CEO', 'event study', 'retirement', 'resource dependence', 'sensemaking', 'sensegiving', 'succession', 'EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'SYMBOLIC MANAGEMENT', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DEPENDENCE', 'TURNOVER', 'MARKET', 'AGENCY', 'POWER']","['ceo', 'event study', 'retirement', 'resource dependence', 'sensemaking', 'sensegiving', 'succession', 'dependence', 'turnover', 'market']","['resource dependence', 'sensemaking sensegiving', 'ceo succession', 'executive turnover', 'retirement', 'sensegiving']",0.5,0.3

"The purpose of this paper is to draw together the many different facets of corporate governance that have been examined in the extensive literature in both strategic management and finance. In particular, we are interested in the relationship between the typical agency theory constructs of monitoring, incentives and ownership structure, with financial performance. First, we catalog this large body of work to see where there are still unanswered questions. We find that previous work has generally focused on examining subsets of governance mechanisms, typically studying one or two governance variables in any one study. Our view is that the most critical issue still to examine, is the ability of firms to choose among a number of different governance mechanisms in order to create the appropriate structure for that firm, given the environment in which it operates. We identify a sample of firms and examine CEO compensation, CEO tenure, board composition, leadership structure and ownership structure and their contribution to both market performance. Market Value Added, and risk-adjusted accounting performance, Economic Value Added. In addition, we control for ownership by block-holders, industry performance, and firm size. We examine these measures both individually and as interactions. Our results indicate that while some of the traditional agency variables do impact performance, both individually and as interactions, industry performance is a strong and significant driver of performance for our sample of firms. We conclude that, while there is evidence to support that firms may use governance packages to deal with agency issues, further research could provide important evidence on these issues by focusing on examining a more refined, industry-level context.

"In today's highly dynamic and interactive business environment, the role of customer engagement (CE) in cocreating customer experience and value is receiving increasing attention from business practitioners and academics alike. Despite this interest, systematic scholarly inquiry into the concept and its conceptual distinctiveness from other, associated relational concepts has been limited to date. This article explores the theoretical foundations of CE by drawing on relationship marketing theory and the service-dominant (S-D) logic. The analysis also examines the use of the term engagement in the social science, management, and marketing academic literatures, as well as in specific business practice applications. Five fundamental propositions (FPs) derived from this analysis are used to develop a general definition of CE, and distinguish the concept from other relational concepts, including participation and involvement. The five propositions are used in the development of a framework for future research, the undertaking of which would facilitate the subsequent refinement of the conceptual domain of CE.

"Purpose - The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of industry clockspeed on the relationship between supply chain management (SCM) practices, from both upstream and downstream sides of the supply chain, and SCM performance. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a questionnaire sent to manufacturing companies in the Republic of Ireland. The relationships between the constructs are analysed through regression analysis. Findings - The results suggest that the relationship between SCM practices and SCM performance is not monotonic across varying levels of industry clockspeed. Although mixed support was found for the hypothesized relationships, this research contributes considerably to the theoretical development of the contingency view in the SCM literature. Practical implications - Managers should be aware that the rate of change in their industries can affect the way SCM practices across the supply chain impact on SCM performance. Originality/value - The literature review has shown that empirical studies which address the relationship between SCM practices and SCM performance provide mixed results. One possible explanation lies in the contingency theory. This paper contributes to the theoretical development of the contingency view in the SCM literature by showing that industry clockspeed affects the way SCM practices impact on SCM performance.","['Supply chain management practices', 'Supply chain management performance', 'Contingency theory', 'Industry clockspeed', 'Supply chain management', 'Contingency planning', 'Republic of Ireland', 'EXTERNAL INTEGRATION', 'CONTINGENCY THEORY', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'IMPACT', 'OPERATIONS', 'FLEXIBILITY', 'EFFICIENCY', 'STRATEGY', 'QUALITY', 'CAPABILITIES']","['contingency theory', 'industry clockspeed', 'supply chain management', 'republic of ireland', 'contingency theory', 'impact']","['industry clockspeed', 'supply chain management', 'clockspeed', 'contingency view']",0.5,0.3333333333333333
"We extend our theoretical understanding of the effect of key employee mobility on organizational performance. We find that when an organization with an advantageous set (if routines loses a key employee to a competitor, the advantaged organization's competitive position is reduced vis-a-vis the hiring competitor. What is more interesting is that we also show that the diffusion of an advantageous set of routines through the mobility of key employees may affect competitive advantage in at least two additional ways. Our findings result from an analysis of 412 competitive events between the Son Francisco 49ers and all other teams in the National Football League during the 24-year period when the San Francisco 49ers perfected the routines of a strategic innovation that has become known as the West Coast Offense. First, we find that there is a loss of advantage,for the organization when competitors increasingly compete against additional organizations that hired key employees from it. Second, we find that there is a loss of advantage for the organization when competitors expect future competition against additional organizations that hired key employees from it. Our results challenge the traditional argument that socially complex routines create sustainable competitive advantages because they are not easily imitated and do not rely on any single individual. Instead, we show that routines art stable to the loss of key employees, but the advantages derived from them are not.

"This study examines cultural views of venture failure through the lens of sensemaking, which includes attributions of causality. Specifically, we explore failure accounts that are attributed to mistakes made by entrepreneurs, and those attributed to misfortunes outside the control of the entrepreneur. Reports of entrepreneurial failures from 1999 to 2001 were collected from seven major US newspapers, and 389 accounts of failure were analyzed for statements identifying the failure's cause. The data suggest that cultural sensemaking of failure varies by the geographical area where failure occurs. In addition, 331 accounts of the consequences of failure were analyzed which suggest that failure has a large impact on the stigmatization of the entrepreneur and entrepreneurship within the local area, as well as on the individual entrepreneur's view of themselves following failure.

"Stewardship theory has been used to explain the culture and relationships within family businesses. Researchers have also demonstrated that stewardship leads to superior family business performance. To date, few empirical analyses have examined the situational mechanisms associated with stewardship in family business. This paper examines the role of the family in explaining stewardship within a family business, including the role of trust, value commitment, and agency. We find that value commitment, trust, and agency perceptions explain a significant portion of stewardship variance for family and nonfamily business employees. We further find that family member employees perceive significantly higher value commitment, trust, and stewardship perceptions and lower agency perceptions in family firm leadership than nonfamily members, suggesting that blood is indeed thicker than water.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT', 'AGENCY COSTS', 'CONCEPTUAL ISSUES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CULTURE', 'FIRMS', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'GOVERNANCE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'MODEL']","['performance', 'culture']","['performance', 'trust', 'family firm leadership']",0.3333333333333333,0.5
"I theoretically develop and empirically investigate the role of industry and startup experience on the forecast performance of 2304 entrepreneurs who have started new businesses. Using the Kauffman Firm Survey I show that industry experience is associated with more accurate and less biased entrepreneur expectations. Further, the benefit of industry experience on entrepreneurial forecast performance is greater in high-technology industries. These findings are consistent with knowledge of the setting informing entrepreneurial decision making, especially in highly uncertain environments. However, in contrast to the prevailing view in the literature, I find no significant evidence that startup experience improves entrepreneurial forecast performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Results evidenced confluence of findings based on both ecological measures and dispersion-based collectivism values. Conversely, mean collectivism values fared poorly.

"Recently, a number of researchers seeking to develop cognitive approaches for understanding processes associated with the development and implementation of competitive positioning strategies have drawn attention to the notion of 'cognitive inertia'. Once established, there is a danger that actors may become overly dependent on their mental models of competitive space, to the extent that they fail to notice changes in the material conditions of their business environment, until these changes have become so widespread, or significant in other ways, that their organization's capacity for successful adaptation has been seriously undermined. While there have been several anecdotal accounts of cognitive inertia reported in the literature, and a number of researchers have explored processes of cognitive change in organizations more generally, to date there have been virtually no studies published which have investigated this phenomenon specifically within the domain of competitor assessment. This paper reports one such investigation, a longitudinal field study which explored the extent to which actors' mental models of competitive space in the UK residential estate agency (real estate) industry, an industry characterized by high volatility in recent years, remained stable or changed over time. An initial sample of 208 respondents from 58 firms completed detailed questionnaires at the onset of the recent recession in the UK property market. The questionnaires were designed to elicit the respondents' perceptions of their own organization and various competitors on a number of key dimensions. A sub-sample of 114 respondents from 41 firms returned a further set of completed questionnaires, 12 to 18 months later, when the recession had become deeply established. The findings are entirely consistent with the cognitive inertia hypothesis. The results indicate that the respondents' individual and collective cognitions remained highly stable, despite a significant down-turn in the property market from T1 to T2.","['nan', 'MENTAL MODELS', 'COMPETITIVE GROUPS', 'STRATEGIC GROUPS', 'INDUSTRY', 'MAPS', 'CATEGORIZATION', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'DIMENSIONS', 'EPISODES', 'RENEWAL']","['mental models', 'industry', 'dimensions']",[],0,0.0
"We use a time-based system to help organize, summarize, and analyze research on employee absenteeism published in the last 20 years (1977-1996). Although what is known about some mid-term (4-12 month) origins of absence-taking has been greatly clarified and expanded less is known about long-term (> 12 months) and short-term (1 day - 3 months) origins, or about how causes in different time frames relate to each other. Poor performance and neglectful behaviors serve as reliable offshoots of absenteeism. The long- and short-term etiology of the latter behaviors is unclear, but their shared variance in the mid-term reflects negative job attitudes. Outcomes of absenteeism have received much less research attention. Although mid-term consequences such as reduced performance, turnover and organizational expense are well-established little is known about short- and long-term effects of absence-taking on individuals and their social environments. We conclude with suggestions for more explicit consideration of time frames, causal lags, and aggregation periods in the next decades of absenteeism research.","['nan', 'ABSENCE DISCIPLINARY DECISIONS', 'WORK FAMILY CONFLICT', 'EMPLOYEE ABSENTEEISM', 'JOB-SATISFACTION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT', 'META-ANALYSIS', 'CAUSAL MODEL', 'WITHDRAWAL BEHAVIORS', 'ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION', 'VOLUNTARY TURNOVER']",['employee absenteeism'],"['performance', 'behaviors', 'job attitudes']",0.0,0.0
"This study uses data on the U.S. film industry from 1982 to 2001 to analyze the effects on box office performance of prior relationships between film producers and distributors. In contrast to prior studies, which have appeared to find performance benefits to both buyers and sellers when exchange occurs embedded within existing social relations, we propose that the apparent mutual advantages of embedded exchange can also emerge from endogenous behavior that benefits one party at the expense of the other: actors offer better terms of trade and allocate more resources to transactions embedded within existing social relations, thereby contributing to the ostensible advantages of such exchange patterns. Findings show that not only do distributors exhibit a preference for carrying films involving key personnel with whom they had prior exchange relations, but also they tend to favor these films when allocating scarce resources (opening dates and promotion effort). After controlling for the effects of these decisions, films with deeper prior relations to the distributor perform worse at the box office. The results suggest that, rather than benefiting from repeated exchange, distributors overallocate scarce resources to these prior exchange partners, enacting a self-confirming dynamic.","['nan', 'MARKET', 'EMBEDDEDNESS', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'INFORMATION', 'MOVIES', 'MODEL', 'MOOD', 'RISK', 'FILM']",['film'],[],0,0.0
"We examine organizational field change instigated by activists. Contrary to existing views emphasizing incumbent resistance, we suggest that collaboration between incumbents and challenger movements may emerge when a movement's cultural and relational fabric becomes moderately structured, creating threats and market opportunities but remaining permeable to external influence.

The resulting confluence of cultural and relational structuration between movement and field accelerates the pace but dilutes the radicalness of institutional innovation, ensuring ongoing, incremental field change.

"One of the most important events in the life of an entrepreneurial firm is when it undergoes an initial public offering (IPO). Combining signaling theory with research on the role of information asymmetry in pricing of IPOs this study examines the performance outcomes of two distinct types of agency conflicts at the time of the IPO: adverse selection and moral hazard. Empirical results show a curvilinear (U-shaped) relationship between founders' retained equity and underpricing. This suggests that founders' retained ownership in an entrepreneurial IPO limits adverse selection problems and the associated IPO underpricing; however, at some point entrepreneurs' investment and risk become so great that entrepreneurs may no longer act rationally and moral hazard increases. Empirical findings also indicate that the retained ownership of business angels has a stronger mitigating effect on adverse selection and moral hazard problems than do venture capitalist investors.","['nan', 'INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS', 'VENTURE CAPITALISTS', 'OWNERSHIP', 'MANAGERIAL', 'MARKET', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INVESTMENT', 'REPUTATION', 'VALUATION', 'COMPANIES']","['ownership', 'performance', 'investment']",['conflicts'],0.0,0.0
"Haptic softness is a central product attribute for many fabric-related retailers. Can those retailers use music-an easy to implement in-store atmospheric cue-to influence consumers' perception of this central product attribute? Across four studies, this research shows that high (vs. low) music softness enhances consumers' haptic softness perceptions. We argue that this cross-modal effect occurs owing to a transfer of softness-related associations from the auditory to the haptic modality. To better inform retail practice, we examine three managerially relevant boundary conditions at the product and store levels. Specifically, high music softness increases haptic softness perceptions when (a) the product's haptic quality allows for the sufficient detection of softness, (b) hard flooring is present in the retail environment, and (c) consumers are unaware of music's influence. In terms of practically relevant consequences, we find that enhanced haptic softness perceptions ultimately result in more positive product evaluations like willingness to pay.

"This study proposes that international joint ventures (IJVs) are terminated either when the initial purposes of the formation of the IJV have been achieved (intended termination), or when unanticipated contingencies that emerge in the external, internal, or inter-partner conditions after the establishment of the IJV impede the continuation of its operation (unintended termination). Our study examines the factors that affect intended and unintended termination and the longevity of IJVs. The findings show that approximately 90 percent of all IJV terminations are unintended and 10 percent intended, and that the frequency of intended termination and unintended termination varies noticeably depending on the initial purposes of formation. This suggests that the termination of IJVs is significantly contingent on their formation. The findings also show that the longevity of IJVs varies according to the initial purposes of formation, the initial conditions under which the IJV is formed, and the types of unanticipated contingencies that it encounters. The key theoretical issues and practical implications of the distinction between the intended and unintended termination of IJVs are also discussed.

"The borrowing and application of concepts and theories from underlying disciplines, such as psychology and sociology, is commonplace in organization theory. This article critically reviews this practice in organizational research. It discusses the borrowing of theoretical perspectives across vertical (cross-level) and horizontal (cross-context) boundaries and makes an associated distinction between theories in organizations and theories of organizations. It also explicates several unintended consequences and metatheoretical challenges associated with theory borrowing and highlights the legitimate reasons and ways for borrowing theories. By way of example, this article reviews how theories and concepts have been borrowed and applied in organizational research from two different literatures: individual identity and social movements.

"As traditional sources of competitive advantage shrink, firms seek new ones. One such source of competitive advantage is product design because of its effects on customer experience. To understand the role and impact of product design on customer experience, we propose an integrated, customer-based framework for product design that we call the total product design concept (TPDC). We define a product's TPDC as consisting of three elements, namely functionality, aesthetics, and meaning, each of which arises from more elemental product characteristics. We elaborate on the structure of a product's TPDC, its three elements, and the links between those elements and customers' experience with a product. We provide an illustrative application of the TPDC using data from the U.S. auto market. The findings from that application support the proposed three-dimensional view of the TPDC, and demonstrate heterogeneity both in the TPDC's structure and its effects on customer satisfaction. For all three segments, functionality enhances customer satisfaction. For the largest segment of customers, functionality is the most important factor, followed by aesthetics. For the other two segments, customer satisfaction is most influenced by the meaning element of TPDC. We discuss the implications of these findings for the auto industry in particular, and the potential use of the TPDC more generally.","['nan', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'INDUSTRIAL-DESIGN', 'AESTHETICS', 'DECISIONS', 'CONSUMERS', 'ROLES', 'FORM']",['aesthetics'],"['product design', 'customer experience', 'aesthetics', 'satisfaction']",0.25,1.0

"In this paper we explore some of the potential determinants of foreign exchange (FX) exposure and firm value. We contribute to previous research on stock returns and firm value as we have access to a unique survey database and can include as determinants in our empirical analysis the objectives and emphasis on risk management, as well as considering previous factors including the nature of the business environment. We can also examine any regional influences as our sample includes UK, US and Asia Pacific multinational companies (MNCs). As predicted by theory, we find some evidence that MNCs with greater foreign operations have a larger magnitude of FX exposure. However, our proxy for the emphasis of FX management does not have the predicted negative association with the magnitude of FX, indicating that managers may focus on short-term cash flows in their FX management rather than firm value. With regard to the potentially differential regional role of our variables, a range of interesting results is found. Arguably, in our most notable such finding, we see that the contribution of overseas business to total revenues has no association with the magnitude of FX exposure for US MNCs: it has a positive role for UK MNCs (consistent with theory) and a negative role for Asia Pacific MNCs, which could be explained by macroeconomic and/or financial characteristics of the MNCs in the sample.","['foreign exchange', 'risk exposure', 'cross-sectional determinants', 'NON-FINANCIAL FIRMS', 'RISK-MANAGEMENT', 'WHARTON SURVEY', 'DERIVATIVES']","['foreign exchange', 'risk management']","['exchange', 'firm value', 'risk management']",0.3333333333333333,0.5
"People often estimate how they compare to other consumers when they make purchase decisions. Unfortunately, they tend to err in this task, and this can lead to negative consequences in their choices. Previous literature has largely argued that these errors in estimates of relative standing are due to underweighting or ignoring the reference group. Using a novel measure of people's perception of the reference group, we show that consumers do attend to that information but err in their estimates of relative standing because they tend to overestimate the dispersion of others' performances and attributes. Three studies support this argument and provide insights that enable marketers to alter consumers' relative assessment process in formerly discounted ways. We demonstrate straightforward tools that can change consumers' impressions of others and thus change relative assessments and purchase decisions.","['nan', 'UNREALISTIC OPTIMISM', 'ABOVE-AVERAGE', 'EGOCENTRISM', 'SELF', 'JUDGMENTS', 'BIAS', 'AVAILABILITY', 'HEURISTICS', 'PERCEPTION', 'DIFFICULTY']",['perception'],"['decisions', 'information', 'assessment']",0.0,0.0

However, a curvilinear model rather, than a linear model, was found to best capture the relationships of interest.

"Celebrity endorsement has become a prevalent form of advertising in the United States. Despite extensive literature on the effects of celebrity endorsements on consumers' brand attitudes and purchase intentions, little is known about the economic Value of these endorsements. Research on this topic has typically focused on theories explaining how celebrity endorsements influence consumers' attitudes and intentions. The authors assess the impact of celebrity endorsement contracts on the expected profitability of a firm by using event study methodology. Their approach assumes that the announcement of a celebrity endorsement contract, usually widely publicized in the business press, is used as information by market analysts to evaluate the potential profitability of endorsement expenditures, thereby affecting the firm's expected return. Announcements of 110 celebrity endorsement contracts were analyzed. Results indicate that, on average, the impact of these announcements on stock returns is positive and suggest that celebrity endorsement contracts are generally viewed as a worthwhile investment in advertising.","['nan', 'ADVERTISING EFFECTIVENESS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'IMPACT', 'PERSPECTIVE']",['impact'],"['advertising', 'contracts', 'event study', 'expenditures']",0.0,0.0

This framework represents an effective prism through which to view FDI advertising, and Dunning's location advantages are reflected in advertising content. In an effort to shed more light on FDI advertising, the authors first provide an assessment of how advertising content varies by country income classification. Next, using exploratory factor analysis, they identify the five factors represented in FDI advertising: knowledge resources, market attractiveness, economic governance, infrastructure, and natural resources. The findings suggest that high-income countries tend to focus on knowledge resources, while lower-middle-income countries focus on economic governance. Upper-middle-income countries tap into both knowledge resources and economic governance while also promoting the attractiveness of their market.","['advertising', 'foreign direct investment', 'eclectic theory (OLI)', 'FDI promotion', 'content analysis', 'INDEX']","['advertising', 'foreign direct investment', 'fdi promotion']",['foreign direct investment'],1.0,0.3333333333333333

In addition, because of cross-cultural differences, the effects of high service attentiveness may vary across international markets. The authors conduct a qualitative study, a field experiment, and two laboratory experiments in three countries (Canada, the United States, and China) across various service contexts (hairdressing, telecommunications, and computer repair) to examine cross-cultural consumer responses toward high service attentiveness. Consumers' negative responses toward high service attentiveness are mediated by their suspicion of ulterior motive, which varies according to their self-construal. Specifically, consumers with an interdependent self-construal (either chronic or primed) tend to have greater suspicion of and negative responses toward high service attentiveness. Furthermore, the effect of interdependent self-construal fostering greater suspicion is attributed to a sharper in-group (vs. out-group) distinction, which is mitigated when the service employee is perceived to be an in-group member. The authors conclude by discussing the theoretical and managerial implications and suggesting future research directions.","['consumer responses', 'cultural difference', 'high service attentiveness', 'self-construal', 'suspicion', 'CUSTOMER ORIENTATION', 'RELATIONSHIP QUALITY', 'SELF', 'SATISFACTION', 'PERSUASION', 'SUSPICION', 'COLLECTIVISM', 'FOUNDATIONS', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'ENCOUNTERS']","['consumer responses', 'cultural difference', 'high service attentiveness', 'self construal', 'suspicion', 'self', 'satisfaction', 'suspicion', 'encounters']","['service attentiveness', 'satisfaction', 'suspicion', 'self construal']",0.75,0.3333333333333333
"The notion of distributed agency in institutional work points to the importance of understanding how agents with varying motives and operating at different levels of analysis effect institutional change, but leaves open the question of by whom and how the bridging of their efforts occurs. An institutional-historical analysis of Major League Baseball shows how institutional entrepreneurs as outsiders challenged conventional wisdom, theorized counter wisdoms and mobilized others in the aim of effecting change at the institutional and organizational field levels; and organizational entrepreneurs as insiders selected and acted on the theorizing, to benefit their specific organizations, with their success leading to acceptance of new thinking. By showing how the bridging of these different agents' work occurs, the study contributes to resolving how central players are aided by peripheral players to think beyond the constraints that social structure places on their cognitions, the paradox of embeddedness, and to raising the question of how peripheral players have an effect on core players, the paradox of peripheralness.

"Where knowledge-based firms are located is important because entrepreneurship, firm creation and innovation are typically associated with regional economic development, wealth creation and increased employment. In this paper we examine where academic entrepreneurs locate their firms. We begin by developing a theoretical model that examines the location choice of the academic entrepreneur within the standard utility maximization theory. Academic entrepreneurs are assumed to maximize their utility by allocating their efforts between academic and entrepreneurial pursuits which, in turn, determine their future streams of income and end-period wealth. Optimal allocation turns out to be a function of both personal and external factors that condition the relevant payoffs and such factors can be empirically observed. We then use several candidate explanatory variables to examine those factors that may influence the firm location choice for 187 biopharmaceutical firms started by 275 academic entrepreneurs in the US. From our empirical analysis we find that location-specific factors such as proximity to certain knowledge assets and to the funding venture capital firms, affect the firm location choice of academic entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, entrepreneur-specific characteristics, such as their age, seem to dominate the choice of firm location. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"Empirical studies of mergers and acquisitions typically focus on firm-level financial performance. In contrast, we use human capital theory to model these events as transactions that simultaneously have cross-level, real effects on workers, plants, and firms. Our empirical analysis is based on longitudinal, linked employer-employee data for virtually all Swedish manufacturing firms and employees. We find that mergers and acquisitions enhance plant productivity, although they also result in the downsizing of establishments and firms. Firm performance does not decline in the aftermath of these ownership changes. We conclude that such transactions constitute a mechanism for improving the sorting and matching of plants and workers to more efficient uses.

"Through an inductive, qualitative study, I developed a process model of how people deal with professional identities they have forgone by choice or constraint. I show that, when forgone professional identities are linked to unfulfilled values, people look for ways to enact them and retain them in the self-concept. I further identify three strategies that people use to enact foregone professional identities: (1) real enactment (i.e., enacting the forgone identity through real activities and social interactions either at work or during leisure time), (2) imagined enactment (i.e., enacting the forgone identity through imagined activities and interactions, either in an alternate present or in the future), and (3) vicarious enactment (i.e., enacting the forgone identity by observing and imagining close others enacting it and internalizing these experiences). These findings expand our conceptualization of professional identity beyond identities enacted through activities and interactions that are part of formal work roles, and illuminate the key role of imagination and vicarious experiences in identity construction and maintenance.","['nan', 'PERSON-ENVIRONMENT FIT', 'PERSPECTIVE-TAKING', 'POSSIBLE SELVES', 'DIRTY WORK', 'SELF-REGULATION', 'MENTAL PRACTICE', 'VALUES', 'FUTURE', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'PERFORMANCE']","['values', 'future']",['enactment'],0.0,0.0
"This article deals with explaining the sizable differences in the rate of self-employment (business ownership) across 15 European countries in the period 1978-2000, within a framework of occupational choice, focusing on the influence of dissatisfaction and of per capita income. Using two different measures of dissatisfaction, in addition to the level of economic development and controlling for several other variables, we find that, in addition to a negative and significant impact of per capita income, dissatisfaction at the level of societies has a positive and significant influence on self-employment levels. Both dissatisfaction with life and dissatisfaction with the way democracy works are found to influence self-employment. It is concluded that these are proxies for job dissatisfaction and at the same time represent other negative displacements known to promote self-employment. The findings indirectly point at the potential importance of push factors within the incentive structures of modern economies.","['nan', 'FIRM FORMATION', 'SATISFACTION', 'ALLOCATION', 'MODEL', 'RISK']",['satisfaction'],"['self employment', 'dissatisfaction', 'job dissatisfaction']",0.0,0.0
"As service organizations increasingly use physical and virtual channels for customer contact, a seamless customer experience within and across channels reflects the integration quality of multichannel services. This study investigates the factors affecting integration quality and their impact on multichannel design and management. The study was undertaken as a qualitative, multimethod, multisite, case research with a consumer bank, its customers and its technology partner firms. The research findings identify forms of misalignment occurring between organizational perception and design of a multichannel system and customer expectations of a multichannel service experience. Such misalignment not only negatively impact integration quality but also make customers susceptible to terminating the relationship with the service provider. The study also identifies that integration quality does not result from the lone actions of a single entity, such as the organization. The interplay of actions between the organization, its wider institutional environment, and its customers collectively influence integration quality. From a managerial perspective, the study identifies aspects of multichannel process design and management for positive integration quality.","['multichannel systems', 'integration quality', 'service settings', 'multimethod research', 'qualitative longitudinal study', 'MULTIPLE-ITEM SCALE', 'CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT', 'SYSTEMS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'SATISFACTION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'CONFLICT', 'FAILURE', 'IMPACT', 'MODEL']","['integration quality', 'impact']","['integration', 'multichannel design']",0.0,0.0
"This paper examines how ambient noise, an important environmental variable, can affect creativity. Results from five experiments demonstrate that a moderate (70 dB) versus low (50 dB) level of ambient noise enhances performance on creative tasks and increases the buying likelihood of innovative products. A high level of noise (85 dB), on the other hand, hurts creativity. Process measures reveal that a moderate (vs. low) level of noise increases processing difficulty, inducing a higher construal level and thus promoting abstract processing, which subsequently leads to higher creativity. A high level of noise, however, reduces the extent of information processing and thus impairs creativity.","['nan', 'ROMANTIC MOTIVES', 'PRODUCT', 'THINKING', 'FLUENCY', 'TASK', 'INNOVATIVENESS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'AROUSAL', 'BREADTH']","['product', 'task', 'performance']",['noise'],0.0,0.0
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether supply chain (SC) ambidexterity improves supply chain flexibility (SCF) and its impact on SC competence and firm performance. A new measurement instrument for SCF is proposed that takes into account the demands of the environment: SCF fit. Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical model is developed to examine the relationships proposed. The hypotheses are tested with data from 302 manufacturing firms using a structural equations model methodology. Findings - The results show that SC ambidexterity helps to achieve the optimal level of SCF and that supply chain management (SCM) is important to firm performance. Research limitations/implications - This paper makes three contributions to the SCM literature: first, it develops the conceptual definition of SC ambidexterity and studies its effects at the SC level; second, it develops a new instrument to measure SCF known as SCF fit; third, it studies both the impact of SCF fit on SC competence and the importance of SC in firm performance. Practical implications - This paper develops a measurement instrument that permits managers to diagnose the level of SCF and the correspondence/gap between current and optimal levels and to establish comparisons between different SC. It also indicates the importance of SCM for firm performance and the need to consider the SC as a whole. Originality/value - This is one of the first studies to analyze ambidexterity in an organizational network like the SC. It shows that exploitation practices do not jeopardize SCF as long as they are accompanied by exploration practices. That is, high levels of exploration and exploitation are compatible in the SC and lead to the optimal level of SCF.","['Ambidexterity', 'Structural equation model', 'SCM competency', 'Supply chain flexibility fit', 'MEASURING ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'BEHAVIORAL-RESEARCH', 'MANAGEMENT', 'EXPLORATION', 'EXPLOITATION', 'STRATEGY', 'ISOMORPHISM', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'INTEGRATION', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['ambidexterity', 'management', 'exploration', 'exploitation']","['flexibility', 'firm performance', 'supply chain management']",0.0,0.0
"Research on how store environment cues influence consumers' store choice decision criteria, such as perceived merchandise value and shopping experience costs, is sparse. Especially absent is research on the simultaneous impact of multiple store environment cues. The authors propose a comprehensive store choice model that includes (1) three types of store environment cues (social, design, and ambient) as exogenous constructs, (2) various store choice criteria (including shopping experience costs that heretofore have not been included in store choice models) as mediating constructs, and (3) store patronage intentions as the endogenous construct. They then empirically examine the extent to which environmental cues influence consumers' assessments of a store on various store choice criteria and how those assessments, in turn, influence patronage intentions. The results of two different studies provide support for the model. The authors conclude by discussing the results to develop an agenda for additional research and explore managerial implications.","['nan', 'CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS', 'PHYSICAL SURROUNDINGS', 'PURCHASING BEHAVIOR', 'PRODUCT EVALUATIONS', 'SERVICE QUALITY', 'PRICE', 'MUSIC', 'ATMOSPHERE', 'IMPACT', 'TIME']",['impact'],"['social design', 'patronage intentions']",0.0,0.0
"Research summary: This study explores how relative prominence shapes rivalry between firms. Corporate litigation, an increasingly costly domain of interfirm rivalry, is threatening not just because of the immediate legal stakes but because of the indirect losses that unwanted negative publicity inflicts on defendants. I argue that potential defendants' incentives to avoid such losses create a source of value that firms can capture by agreeing to forgo litigation. The more prominent a firm is relative to rivals, the greater its threat and the more value it stands to capture from potential targets by sparing them from litigation. Managerial summary: The power to attract media attention can be valuable to firms beyond its role in managing relations with investors or the public. It can also provide leverage against industry rivals. Being sued by a prominent firm carries the threat of potential damaging publicity, especially for lesser-known rivals. Firms may be able to leverage this threat to elicit concessions in return for sparing rivals from litigation. Prominent firms stand to benefit not just from eliciting concessions from rivals but from the ability to do so while avoiding costly litigation. Data from the semiconductor industry show that firms that command much higher levels of media coverage than rivals are able to avoid litigation more often than firms with comparable or lower levels of media coverage.

"Dual distribution in franchising is addressed from an incomplete contracting perspective.

Comparative analysis shows that though there is some support for consumer and goods firms being more transactional and business and service firms being more relational, there are many exceptions. The results also show that firms can be grouped into those whose marketing practices are predominantly transactional, predominantly relational, or a transactional/relational hybrid. Each group constitutes approximately one-third of the sample and includes all types of firms (consumer goods, consumer services, business-to-business goods, and business-to-business services). This suggests that marketing practices are pluralistic and managerial practice has not shifted from transactional to relational approaches per se.","['nan', 'SERVICES', 'INDUSTRIAL', 'CONSUMER', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGIES', 'DICHOTOMY', 'BUSINESS']","['services', 'consumer', 'business']",[],0,0.0
"As in other social sciences, published findings in consumer research tend to overestimate the size of the effect being investigated, due to both file drawer effects and abuse of researcher degrees of freedom, including opportunistic analysis decisions. Given that most effect sizes are substantially smaller than would be apparent from published research, there has been a widespread call to increase power by increasing sample size. We propose that, aside from increasing sample size, researchers can also increase power by boosting the effect size. If done correctly, removing participants, using covariates, and optimizing experimental designs, stimuli, and measures can boost effect size without inflating researcher degrees of freedom. In fact, careful planning of studies and analyses to maximize effect size is essential to be able to study many psychologically interesting phenomena when massive sample sizes are not feasible.","['experimental design', 'effect size', 'statistical power', 'sample size', 'ANCOVA', 'data cleaning', 'CONSUMER RESEARCH', 'DEMAND ARTIFACTS']","['experimental design', 'effect size', 'sample size', 'consumer research']",['power'],0.0,0.0
"To exploit first-mover advantages, pioneers may be motivated to amass customers before rivals enter the market. Likewise, when they enjoy increasing returns due to network effects, static scale economies, or learning effects, companies have incentives to invest aggressively in growth. This paper presents econometric analysis of factors that determined the intensity of Internet companies' investments in growth, and analyzes the long-term performance consequences of such investments. Results indicate that first movers spent significantly more on upfront marketing than non-pioneers. Contrary to expectations, however, firms in markets that exhibited increasing returns did not spend more on their early customer acquisition efforts than other sample companies. Although the typical sample company did not earn positive long-term returns, heavy early investments in growth were nevertheless economically rational. In most cases, reducing marketing outlays would have worsened a bad outcome, consistent with an inverted 'U' relationship between long-term returns and upfront marketing spending. Thus, the typical sample company invested in marketing, ex ante, at levels close to those that would have maximized returns, observed ex post.

"Recent technological advances in interactive marketing allow consumers to use a 'virtual mirror' (created with their own digital photo uploaded to a retailer's Web site) to see how products would look on them. The virtual mirror can be used for simulated product experiences in virtual shopping environments (e.g., trying a garment or a pair of sunglasses in an Internet shopping mall). To enhance our understanding of the managerial implications of this new marketing tool, we test whether the images consumers select to construct their 'virtual mirror' influence their product evaluations. Psychological theorizing suggests that it is difficult to distinguish one's reaction to the product from one's reaction to the personal image to which the product is applied, giving rise to misattribution effects. Consistent with this assumption, three studies show that consumers evaluate a product more favorably the more they like the image used to construct a virtual mirror (for themselves or for someone they personally know); the variables used to enhance consumers' liking of their virtual mirror include the consumer's own facial expression (Study 1), a visual enhancement of the image (Study 2), and a regular vs. mirror image format (Study 3).

"State-owned (SO) enterprises are subject to more complex institutional pressures in host countries than private firms. These institutional pressures arise from a weak legitimacy of state ownership in some countries, which arises from a combination of ideological conflicts, perceived threats to national security, and claimed unfair competitive advantage due to support by the home country government. These institutional pressures directed specifically at SO firms induce them to adapt their foreign entry strategies to reduce potential conflicts and to enhance their legitimacy. Testing hypotheses derived from this theoretical argument for subsidiaries of listed Chinese firms, we find that SO firms adapt mode and control decisions differently from private firms to the conditions in host countries, and these differences are larger where pressures for legitimacy on SO firms are stronger. These findings not only extend institutional theory to better explain differential effects on different entrants to an organizational field, but demonstrate how foreign investors of idiosyncratic origins may proactively build legitimacy in host societies.","['state-owned enterprises', 'institutional theory', 'foreign market entry', 'establishment mode', 'control mode', 'Chinese multinationals', 'TRANSACTION COST INFLUENCES', 'MODE CHOICE', 'CHINESE FIRMS', 'OUTWARD FDI', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'OWNERSHIP', 'DISTANCE', 'DETERMINANTS', 'CAPITALISM']","['institutional theory', 'chinese firms', 'ownership']","['firms', 'legitimacy', 'state ownership']",0.0,0.0
"In this paper, we study whether a hotel should cooperate with an independent online travel agency (OTA) to sell rooms, and, if yes, using what business model-the Merchant model or the Agency model. In the Merchant model, the OTA purchases rooms at a discount wholesale price and sells them at a profit, but takes on the risk of having unsold inventory. In the Agency model, the OTA passes reservations booked by its customers to the hotel and receives an agreed commission fee on each transaction. We demonstrate that there is no one strategy tailored to all situations: the choices of channel and business model are closely tied to certain conditions, like the hotel's room capacity, consumer acceptance of the OTA channel, the increase in market size with the OTA channel and the commission rate charged by the OTA. The hotel's equilibrium strategy indicates that adding the OTA channel does not increase the hotel's profit if the hotel's capacity, the increase in market size with the OTA channel, and consumer acceptance of the OTA channel are relatively small. Regarding the selection of business model, in general, larger hotels offered a larger increase in market size with the OTA channel, and where the commission rate is low, will prefer the Agency model; otherwise hotels will prefer the Merchant model. Managerial guidance regarding channel and business model selection is provided. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Production pressure is often cited as an underlying contributory factor of organizational accidents. The relationship, however, between production and safety protection is complex and has not been adequately addressed by current theories regarding organizational accident. In addressing this gap, this paper uses the methodology of system dynamics to develop a causal model to address the dynamic interaction between management of production and protection, which can accumulate in an organizational accident. A case study of a fatal rock fall accident in Tasmania, Australia was conducted based on the developed model and is used to uncover the intricate dynamics linking production pressure, risk tolerability, perception of safety margin, and protection efforts. In particular, the study demonstrates how a strong production focus can trigger a vicious cycle of deteriorating risk perception and how increased protection effort can, ironically, lead to deterioration of protection.","['causal loop', 'crisis', 'mining', 'organizational accident', 'risk', 'SAFETY CLIMATE', 'RISK PERCEPTION', 'SENSEMAKING', 'DISASTER', 'MANAGEMENT', 'DYNAMICS', 'STRATEGY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'FAILURE', 'PROJECT']","['organizational accident', 'risk', 'risk perception', 'management', 'dynamics']","['accidents', 'system dynamics']",0.0,0.0
"Strategic human capital research has emphasized the importance of human capital as a resource for sustained competitive advantage, but firm investments in this intangible asset vary considerably. This article examines whether and how external pressures on firms from capital markets influence their human capital strategy. These pressures have increased over the past three decades due to banking deregulation, technological innovation, and the rise of institutional investors and new financial intermediaries. Against this backdrop, this study examines whether a firm's capital structure as measured by share turnover, shareholder concentration, and financial leverage is associated with firm investment in strategic human capital. Based on survey and objective financial data from 221 establishments in the United States and Canada, our analysis indicates that firms with greater share turnover, higher shareholder concentration, and higher levels of financial leverage are less likely to invest in human resource systems that create strategic human capital. Differences in national financial systems also lead to differential effects for U.S. and Canadian firms.","['capital structure', 'financial markets', 'ownership', 'human capital', 'high involvement work systems', 'PERFORMANCE WORK PRACTICES', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES', 'VOLUNTARY TURNOVER', 'CUSTOMER SERVICE', 'HUMAN-RESOURCES', 'CALL CENTERS']","['capital structure', 'human capital', 'competitive advantage']","['human capital', 'turnover']",0.5,0.3333333333333333

"How universal are resource-based advantages? In this study, the authors suggest that differences in nations' institutional environments may influence the applicability of resource-based advantages; for this reason, the effectiveness of such advantages may vary cross-nationally. They hypothesize and find that adding the moderating influence of national institutional environment to a resource-based perspective better explains strategic decisions (entry mode choice) in an international context than does a mere resource-based approach. The analysis also shows that decisions predicted by a model incorporating both perspectives yield better subsidiary performance. Thus, results suggest that, at least in an international setting, resource-based advantages appear to be context specific. Based on these results, the authors conclude that considering country-specific contextual influences on the value of resource-based advantages allows firms to make strategic decisions that improve international subsidiary performance.","['resource-based view', 'institutional theory', 'context specificity', 'performance', 'dynamic capabilities', 'ENTRY MODE CHOICE', 'TRANSACTION COST', 'FIRM CAPABILITIES', 'FOREIGN-MARKET', 'VIEW', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGY', 'EXPLOITATION', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'COOPERATION']","['performance', 'entry mode choice', 'performance', 'environments']","['resource based advantages', 'resource based perspective', 'entry mode choice', 'resource based approach']",0.25,0.25
"Purpose - The paper aims to compare the coordination of supply chain networks in contractually different complex construction projects. Design/methodology/approach - A comparative case study of the coordination of collaborative work in two successful hospital construction projects was conducted. One of the projects applied multiple dyadic contracts, whereas the other project applied one multi-party contract between the parties. The projects were located in the USA. Data were collected by observing the coordination on the construction sites for six weeks and by conducting 72 interviews. Findings - The paper shows that depending on the contract type, the timing and extent of complementary procedural coordination differs during projects. Compared with one multi-party contract, the dyadic contracts needed to be complemented during the design phase with three additional procedural coordination mechanisms: organizational design, processes for collaborative work and integrated concurrent engineering sessions. Additionally, common rules of conduct were taken into use during the construction phase. However, regardless of the contract type, procedural coordination mechanisms, such as co-located working, collaborative decision-making in inter-organizational meetings, a liaison role and shared project goals were needed throughout the projects. Practical implications - If multiple dyadic contracts are applied, procedural coordination mechanisms have to be co-created by all supply chain parties at the beginning of the project.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyse a case of local freight stakeholder involvement to plan and design eco-efficient city logistics innovations in Como, a small city in Italy. While the importance of a well-functioning urban goods distribution system is widely acknowledged, city authorities have become increasingly aware of the need to minimise the negative impacts associated to the system. There are now countless examples of attempts to increase the eco-efficiency of urban freight deliveries; however, very few have made a notable impact. The success of such schemes often depends upon the response of a range of private sector freight stakeholders and their involvement during the planning process of these solutions is crucial. Design/methodology/approach - To engage local freight stakeholders within the planning process of a city logistics project, the logical framework approach, in the form of the design and monitoring framework (DMF) developed by the Asian Development Bank, has been applied. Findings - The structured consultation process implied within the DMF approach allowed urban freight stakeholders to share their aspirations from the beginning of the city freight planning process, despite their differences in priorities in adopting eco-efficient logistics innovations. The process ensured that city stakeholders accepted and committed to the city logistics strategies formulated during the consultation process, namely: changes to the Limited Traffic Zone regulation, the use of an urban consolidation centre and hybrid electric truck adoption. Research limitations/implications - The evaluation of the DMF application will be definitive after the demonstration/implementation stage of the city logistics project. It will then become clear if freight stakeholders have committed to the project and if it is effective in delivering the expected outputs and outcomes. Practical implications - Local city authorities may find this method useful in situations where a structured consultation process is needed for addressing urban freight issues. This is especially the case in the context of introducing innovative, eco-efficiency solutions. Originality/value - The application of DMF in the developed environment can be considered novel; this paper extends this with an application to the promotion of sustainable urban freight.","['City logistics', 'Design and monitoring framework', 'Logical framework approach', 'Public consultation process', 'Urban freight', 'FREIGHT TRANSPORT', 'MANAGEMENT', 'OPERATIONS', 'GOODS']","['city logistics', 'design and monitoring framework', 'logical framework approach', 'urban freight', 'goods']",[],0,0.0

"This study examines the role of national culture on the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) rhetoric contained within franchisee recruitment promotional materials, where EO rhetoric is defined as the strategic use of words in organizational narratives to convey the risk taking, innovativeness, proactiveness, autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness of the firm. The sample comprised 378 franchise organizations, in five different countries (Australia, France, India, South Africa, and the UK). The results indicate that franchise systems operating in high uncertainty avoidance and feminine cultures use less entrepreneurially oriented rhetoric, suggesting that EO rhetoric in franchise organizations varies according to different national cultural contexts.","['franchising', 'entrepreneurial orientation', 'national culture', 'AIDED TEXT ANALYSIS', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'VALUES', 'FIRMS', 'INDIVIDUALISM', 'DIMENSIONS', 'INNOVATION', 'CONSTRUCT', 'HOFSTEDE']","['entrepreneurial orientation', 'national culture']",['culture'],0.0,0.0

We examine individuals facing real or hypothetical decisions to discontinue their infants' life support who either choose personally or have physicians choose for them. Findings from a multidisciplinary approach consisting of a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews and three laboratory studies reveal that perceived personal causality for making tragic decisions generates more negative feelings than having the same choices externally made. Tragic decisions also undermine coping abilities, weakening the desire for autonomy. Consequently, participants disliked making decisions but also resented relinquishing their option to choose.","['nan', 'INTENSIVE-CARE UNITS', 'CONSUMER DECISIONS', 'OMISSION', 'ILLUSION', 'REGRET', 'SATISFACTION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'CONSUMPTION', 'COMMISSION', 'PREFERENCE']",['preference'],[],0,0.0

Yet, research evidence on the performance benefits of international venturing activities has been contradictory.

"While many theories of the firm seek to explain when firms make rather than buy, in practice firms often make and buy the same inputthey engage in plural sourcing. We argue that explaining the mix of external procurement and internal sourcing for the same input requires a consideration of complementarities across and constraints within modes of procurement. We create analytical foundations for making empirical predictions about when plural sourcing is likely to be optimal and why the optimal mix of internal and external sourcing may vary across situations. Our framework also proves useful for assessing the possible estimation biases in transaction level make-or-buy studies arising from ignoring complementarities and constraints.

"The negativity effect, or the greater weighing of negative as compared with equally extreme positive information in the formation of overall evaluations, is widely believed by media planners and appears to be a well-proven phenomenon in consumer psychology. Although this effect has been extensively documented under conditions of moderate to high processing involvement in the literature, its robustness in consumer environments may be overstated. Specifically, there are important differences between the experimental settings in which this effect has typically been obtained and marketplace conditions. For instance, subjects in past studies have typically evaluated unknown or hypothetical targets with the goal of forming an accurate impression. In the marketplace, consumers may be familiar with brands and likely to process brand-related information with a variety of other processing goals, such as impression and defense motivation. Using two experiments, this re-inquiry delineates conditions under which the negativity effect is likely to emerge and those under which it may be less likely to occur.","['nan', 'ISSUE INVOLVEMENT', 'INFORMATION', 'PERSUASION', 'JUDGMENT', 'ACCOUNTABILITY', 'SENSITIVITY', 'INTENTIONS', 'MESSAGES']",['information'],"['information', 'defense motivation']",0.5,1.0
"This article develops a conceptual model to help explain the strength of competitive reactions to new product introductions and presents the findings from a preliminary empirical investigation of this model. Being able to explain the strength of competitive reactions to new product introductions is important, as such reactions often determine a product's success or failure in the marketplace. To explain these reactions Oliver Heil and Rockney Walters investigate competitive market signals associated with new product introductions and the reactions of competing firms to the signals. The authors empirically test the hypothesized linkages among three market signals-hostility, consequences and commitment-and competitive reactions using primary data collected from a large number of US corporations. The empirical results show that the market signaling variables explain a significant portion of the variance in the perceived strength of competitive reactions to new product introductions. The study has implications for managers introducing new products and for researchers studying new product introductions and competition.","['nan', 'BUSINESS PERFORMANCE', 'MARKET', 'INFORMATION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'FAIRNESS', 'ENTRY']",['market'],[],0,0.0
"In this era of globalization how do we explain the home bias, unexpectedly large distance effects, and lagged adjustment patterns visible international exchange? In this per, I argue that in the real world, re identity and reliability of potential exchange partners are seldom the data that most economists take them to be. In fact, firms confront formidable problems of search and deliberation. In these circumstances, firms' social networks can provide a key recourse. Yet, for historical reasons, most firms' social networks still tend to be local or national, And, absent institutional solutions, even in the face of apparent cross-border economic opportunities, firms' responses appear overly sticky and lagged. I explore these arguments in an empirical study that contrasts multinational and domestic firms' trade responses to changes in real exchange rates.","['nan', 'FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'NETWORK', 'LINKS', 'HYPOTHESIS']",['network'],['firms'],0.0,0.0
"The increasing globalization of business provides a compelling reason for understanding the cultural context of consumer behavior. The research reported here examines the impact of culture on consumers' perceptions of service recovery efforts. In particular, we studied in an experimental setting, across East-West cultures, the combined effects of explanation and compensation in shaping customers' attributions and post-recovery perceptions in a medium contact service-a restaurant setting. Our findings show that the differential sensitivity of East Asian and American consumers to situational constraints influence their attributions for service failures, and thus moderate their satisfaction with service recovery process. More specifically, the results suggest that a causal explanation for service failure decreases the likelihood of US consumers falling prey to the fundamental attribution error. Conversely, among East Asians, an explanation had minimal influence in attributional processes. Finally, our results indicate that attributional processes influence customer perceptions of employee effort, which in turn is linked to post-recovery satisfaction. (C) 2004 by New York University.

"Research summary: When faced with a new technological paradigm, incumbent firms can opt for internal development and/or external sourcing to obtain the necessary new knowledge. We explain how the effectiveness of external knowledge sourcing depends on the properties of internal knowledge production. We apply a social network lens to delineate interpersonal, intra-firm knowledge networks and capture the emergence of two important firm-level properties: the incumbent's internal potential for knowledge recombination and the level of knowledge coordination costs. We rely on firm-level internal knowledge networks to dynamically track the emergence of these properties across 106 global pharmaceutical companies over a 25-year time period. We find that a firm's success in developing knowledge in a new technological paradigm using external knowledge sourcing is contingent on these internal knowledge properties. Managerial summary: Incumbent firms in high-tech industries often face competence-destroying technological change. In their effort to adapt and develop new knowledge in a novel paradigm, incumbent firms have several corporate strategy options available to them: internal knowledge development and a wide array of external knowledge sourcing strategies, including alliances and acquisitions. In this study, we make an effort to address a critical question: How effective is external knowledge sourcing under different internal knowledge generation regimes? We find that external sourcing strategies are less effective when firms can already internally generate new knowledge or if they have high internal coordination costs. Therefore, when considering external sourcing, managers must carefully weigh the benefits of it vis-a-vis its commensurate costs as the benefits of external sourcing may be overstated.

"For many firms, using their supply chains as competitive weapons has become a central element of the strategic management process in recent years. Drawing on the resource-based view and theory from the organizational learning and information-processing literatures, this study uses a sample of 201 firms to examine the influence of a culture of competitiveness and knowledge development on supply chain performance in varied market turbulence conditions. We found that synergies exist between a culture of competitiveness and knowledge development: their interaction has a positive association with performance. In addition, based on behavioral and contingency theories, we found that market turbulence moderates these relationships, having a positive influence on the knowledge development-performance link and a negative influence on the culture of competitiveness -performance link. Managers who are confident about the level of market turbulence they will face can use this sense to decide whether to emphasize developing either a culture of competitiveness or knowledge development in their supply chains. For those firms whose managers are unlikely to be able to predict the degree of turbulence they will face over time, a focus on both a culture of competitiveness and knowledge development is critical to ensuring success.

"This research defined, developed, and validated a measure of champion behavior by collecting data from different samples in multiple stages. Using the act frequency method, a comprehensive set of 102 items reflective of champion behavior was developed based on a survey of middle managers and executives. Next, a different managerial sample rated the extent to which each of the 102 items was representative of champion behavior, and 29 were deemed to represent the core of the domain of championship. Finally, to evaluate the psychometric properties of the champion behavior measure, 47 product innovations in 13 firms were studied. Forty-seven nominated champions completed personality measures, 47 top division managers rated project performance, and 216 innovation team members rated champion behavior and leadership style. Results from principal components and confirmatory factor analyses yielded a 14-item champion behavior measure composed of three factors: expressing enthusiasm and confidence about the success of the innovation, persisting under adversity, and getting the right people involved. This measure showed acceptable reliability as well as convergent and discriminant validity. Preliminary evidence of criterion-related validity indicated that the champion behavior measure was also positively related to project performance. Together these analyses provided support for the construct validity of the champion behavior measure. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

"Do domestic firms benefit from the presence of foreign multinational firms? The FDI spillovers literature addresses this very issue, primarily examining whether the presence of foreign firms in a host market leads to technology spillovers and upgrading in domestic firms. A key finding is that spillovers depend on the absorptive capacity of the domestic firm. Yet, in conceptualizing absorptive capacity, scholars have largely overlooked how social structure shapes it. Integrating insights from social networks, technology upgrading, and innovation literatures, I emphasize that a domestic firm's ability to absorb spillovers depends on the social structure it is embedded in. I argue that ties with foreign firms reduce the constraints that domestic firms usually face in searching for and transferring in foreign technologies. However, while search benefits from sparse network structures, transfer is facilitated by cohesive ones. Also, while affect-based ties might motivate foreign firms sufficiently to share information with domestic firms at the search stage, reciprocal benefits and social monitoring conferred by common third-party ties are necessary in the transfer stage. Any effect of ties also depends on the routine repertoire of domestic firms. Put together, these arguments offer a more socialized account of the spillover process.

"Determination of the merchandize assortment is an important decision for retailers since the composition and depth of the product mix greatly impact both unit sales and costs. This paper considers how Probabilistic Selling (PS), an emerging marketing strategy, impacts the type and number of products a retailer should carry. We find that adopting PS can alter the optimal number of products (i.e., encourage the retailer to offer more or fewer products), depending on demand- and supply-side factors. Furthermore, introducing probabilistic goods sometimes increases the optimal degree of product differentiation and sometimes reduces it. Specifically, less differentiated products are warranted if there are either few or many consumers with extreme tastes, but more differentiation is needed otherwise. Our analysis reveals that PS can serve either as a substitute to new product introduction (because it enables a retailer to serve a diverse market at a lower cost) or as a complement to new product introduction (since, under PS, a new product enables a retailer to offer additional probabilistic goods that utilize this new product as one of its components). In sum, our results indicate that a retailer must adjust its merchandize assortment appropriately in order to fully benefit from probabilistic selling. (C) 2015 New York University.

"Purpose - The current state of theory-building in the field of operations and supply chain management (OSCM) is in a strong need of rigorous, empirically based theories that enhance understanding of the causal relationships between the structural elements and properties of the business processes. In this research note the authors propose the critical realism (CR) philosophy of science as a particularly suitable philosophical position (not to the exclusion of others) to review the mechanisms of OSCM knowledge generation and to provide philosophical grounding and methodological guidance for both OSCM theory building and testing. Design/methodology/approach - To demonstrate potential benefits of CR-based structured approach to knowledge generation in OSCM research, this conceptual paper uses a case study that illustrates the adoption of one of the OSCM theories - i.e. the theory of swift, even flow. Findings - CR interprets the accumulated empirical information about OSCM phenomena as observable manifestations of the underlying causal mechanisms that cannot be perceived otherwise. CR can provide epistemological support to the choice of performance measures that manifest the underlying causal mechanisms of interest. Extensive accumulation of empirical data from multiple innovative sources will not dramatically add to understanding of the system under investigation, unless and until the underlying causal mechanisms that trigger the observed behaviour are identified and tested. The CR abductive mode of reasoning emphasises the role of uncertainty in complex process behaviours and can facilitate enrichment and refutation of OSCM theories. Originality/value - CR has a clear potential to contribute to OSCM research by enabling better understanding of causal relationships underlying complex behaviours of different elements of business process by providing robust and relevant mechanisms of generating knowledge about business processes that explicitly link empirical and causal aspects of theory building and testing.","['Critical realism', 'Epistemology', 'Causal mechanisms', 'Operations and supply chain management', 'Theory of swift', 'even flow', 'RESEARCH GUIDELINES', 'EVEN FLOW', 'ORGANIZATION', 'PHILOSOPHY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SCIENCE', 'SWIFT']","['critical realism', 'causal mechanisms', 'operations and supply chain management', 'theory of swift', 'even flow', 'even flow', 'philosophy', 'performance', 'science', 'swift']","['supply chain management', 'critical realism', 'knowledge']",0.3333333333333333,0.1

"Forming international joint ventures (IJVs) with political institutions in emerging economies involves both benefits and risks for multinational enterprises (MNEs). While political partners can provide IJVs with various resources, their political status equips them with a strong position to appropriate rents in IJVs. We address this tension by examining how host state ownership affects both innovation inputs and outputs in China-based IJVs over 2008-2013. Despite the potential government opportunism, we find more R&D investment (innovation inputs) made in IJVs with state partners than in those with private ones. Thus, R&D investment can be politically motivated and symbolically managed to ensure continued resource exchanges with the host state. This political pressure is mitigated when foreign parents directly transfer home-country-based technology to IJVs, when the host-market dependence of IJV is weak, and when IJVs are located in a deregulated region. Moreover, we find foreign-host-state JVs deliver fewer innovation outputs (measured by patent data) than foreign-private JVs, which implies the failure of state partners to adequately absorb foreign technologies. These findings highlight both the state partners' powerfulness to boost IJV innovation investment and their limits in shaping IJV innovation outcomes, and bear rich implications for the management of MNE-host government relationships.","['research and development (R&D)', 'patent', 'international joint ventures', 'state-owned enterprises', 'China', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'TRANSACTION COST', 'INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT', 'EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'EMERGING MARKET', 'FIRM INNOVATION', 'RISK-TAKING', 'OUTWARD FDI']","['patent', 'international joint ventures', 'china']","['international joint ventures', 'ownership', 'china', 'mne host government relationships']",0.5,0.6666666666666666
"Research summary: This article provides a review of real options theory (ROT) in strategic management research. We review the fundamentals of ROT and provide a taxonomy of this research. By synthesizing and critiquing research on real options, we identify a number of important challenges as well as opportunities for ROT if it is to enhance its impact on strategic management and potentially develop into a theoretical pillar in the field. We examine how ROT can inform the key tensions that managers face between commitment versus flexibility as well as between competition versus cooperation, and we show how it can uniquely address the fundamental issues in strategy. We conclude with suggestions on future research directions that could enhance and unify the thus-far distinct main approaches to real options research. Managerial summary: Real options theory (ROT) applies the heuristics and valuation models originally designed for financial securities to the domain of corporate investment decisions (e. g., joint ventures [ JVs], foreign direct investment, research and development [ R& D], etc.) and strategic decision making under uncertainty. This article provides a synthesis of this body of research in strategic management and related disciplines. We suggest how ROT can address fundamental issues of strategy, including the dilemmas managers face between commitment versus flexibility as well as between competition versus cooperation. We discuss how three distinct approaches to real options analysis can complement each other, and we identify some of the main challenges and opportunities for ROT to become a theoretical pillar in strategy.

"A central problem in strategic management is how the inference 'sustainable competitive advantage generates sustainable superior performance' can be put into practice. In this article we develop a theoretical framework, to understand the causal relationships among (1) sustainable competitive advantage, (2) configuration, (3) dynamic capability, and (4) sustainable superior performance. We propose that a firm's competitive advantage, resource bundle configuration, and dynamic learning capability cannot be comprehended by outsiders. Its operational performance, however, can be captured by financial indicators. We promote an inductive Bayesian interpretation of the sustainable competitive advantage proposition. From this viewpoint, the presence or absence of competitive advantage may be reflected in the causal relationship between resource configuration, dynamic capability, and observable financial performance. We apply this theoretical framework to an example drawn from the global semiconductor industry, all area in which resource configuration and dynamic capability are essential to performance.

We test our hypotheses across two independent field studies, comprising an international peace support training mission (Study 1) and a municipality administration (Study 2). Corroborating our predictions, interpersonal cognitive complexity appeared as a conditional mediating variable that can translate an individual's breadth of functional experience into interteam coordination. The strength and direction of this indirect relationship, however, depended on the individual's identification with the organization as a whole. Moreover, on the team level of analysis, we found members' overall interteam coordination to positively relate with team performance in Study 2. All in all, this paper advances new knowledge on the antecedents, mechanisms, contingency factors, and team-level consequences of members' boundary spanning.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'R-AND-D', 'COGNITIVE-COMPLEXITY', 'BOUNDARY SPANNERS', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'COMMUNICATION SKILL', 'MANAGEMENT TEAMS', 'METHOD VARIANCE', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'DIVERSITY']","['cognitive complexity', 'identification']","['social identity', 'cognitive complexity', 'organizational identification', 'performance']",0.25,0.5
"The financial rewards and consequences of entrepreneurship for the individual are unknown. Prior studies have focused on self-employment income estimates and have highlighted the low median earnings that may be anticipated. The apparent financial irrationality of entrepreneurship is typically explained in terms of nonpecuniary compensating factors, such as autonomy and satisfaction. However, the financial rewards of entrepreneurship are multifaceted and include different types and amounts of rewards at different stages of the business life cycle. More accurate reflections of entrepreneurial rewards require researchers to move away from the use of narrow and static measures and instead focus on a broad set of indicators that collectively contribute to overall economic well-being. Entrepreneurial rewards are not only determined by business rationality, but are influenced by household needs that evolve over time. Hence, the analysis of entrepreneurial rewards requires an approach that captures the processes of reward decision making over the business life cycle while contextualizing reward decisions within the entrepreneurial household.","['nan', 'SELF-EMPLOYMENT', 'FAMILY', 'DYNAMICS', 'RETURNS', 'TIME', 'PAY']","['self employment', 'time']","['life cycle', 'decision making']",0.0,0.0
"There is little research that has explored the effects of how knowledge assets are aligned with each other in exploitation and exploration innovation strategies. This study uses alignment theory to explore the effects of aligning knowledge assets on facilitating a firm's ability to pursue ambidexterity, which is defined as the simultaneous pursuit of explorative and exploitative innovation strategies. We also explore the relative influence of organizational and human capital in fostering an exploitation innovation strategy on the one hand, and an exploration innovation strategy on the other. Using a primary survey sample of 127 companies in two high-tech parks in China, we found that greater reliance on relatively more organizational capital versus human capital has a significantly positive impact on the success of an exploitative innovation strategy. The amount of oger positive association with exploratory innovation strategy when social capital is rganizational capital relative to the amount of human capital has a strongreater. We also found that the combination of organizational, human, and social capital fosters ambidexterity, i.e., the simultaneous pursuit of exploration and exploitation. This study extends alignment theory and examines the effects of aligning these knowledge assets on a firm's ability to foster organizational ambidexterity.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'ORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY', 'DYNAMIC THEORY', 'FIRM RESOURCES', 'VALUE CREATION', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'LOCAL SEARCH', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION']","['organizational ambidexterity', 'innovation']","['exploration', 'firm', 'ambidexterity']",0.0,0.0

In support of this argument, the capital that can exceed the benefits resulting from the lay-offs. In support of this argument, the results showed that downsizing had a negative effect on market returns and the effects grow increasingly negative with larger downsizing actions. However, the market reacts more positively to downsizing actions when reallocation strategies are used and to large downsizing actions when disengagement incentives are applied.

"We define organizational improvisation as the degree to which the composition and execution of an action converge in time, and we examine the theoretical potential of this definition. We then propose that both organizational procedural memory (skill knowledge) and declarative memory (fact knowledge) moderate improvisation's impact on organizational outcomes in distinct ways. We also suggest that improvisation influences organizational memory by (1) generating experiments and (2) permitting the development of higher-level competency in improvisation, Contemporary technological changes related to the nature of organizational memory intensify the salience of these issues.","['nan', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'STRATEGY FORMATION', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'INFORMATION', 'INNOVATION', 'TEACHERS', 'NOVICE', 'CREATIVITY', 'EXPERT', 'IMPACT']",['impact'],[],0,0.0
"Previous studies have examined the relationship between cooperation and performance in international equity joint ventures (EJVs), mostly at the partner level. This study revisits the issue at multiple levels, and considers vertical and horizontal cooperation among the foreign partners, the local partner, and the venture management team. The study also examines how goal incongruence between partners and market uncertainty affect the tripartite relationships between cooperation and performance. The test results show a strong positive impact of cooperation between partners on performance as perceived both by the partners and by the venture management team. One partner's cooperation with the venture management team is perceived favorably by that party but not necessarily by the other party unless both partners share the same goal. Market uncertainty requires stronger cooperation at all levels to improve performance in EJVs.","['international equity joint ventures', 'multiparty cooperation', 'goal incongruence', 'NATIONAL CULTURE', 'ENTRY', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'COMPETITION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'SUCCESS', 'CHOICE', 'MODEL', 'TRUST', 'FIRMS']","['international equity joint ventures', 'goal incongruence', 'management']","['cooperation', 'performance', 'international equity joint ventures', 'uncertainty']",0.25,0.3333333333333333
"This study examines the impact of different degrees of organizational coupling among the members of innovation alliance project networks on the commercial performance of collaborative innovations. Specifically, we study how type of innovation (modular vs. architectural innovation) moderates this relationship. Using data from 664 product innovation networks from five different industries in the United States, we find that the degree of organizational coupling among innovation network members significantly affects the commercial performance of collaborative innovations and that the type of innovation has a significant moderating effect.

"In this article, we examine the antecedent structure of the terminal level of job satisfaction of frontline service employees who have recently quit a firm. The results from the estimation of a latent, finite-mixture model, using data collected from former employees of a large supermarket chain, point to a two-dimensional heterogeneity among exiting employees. We find systematic variation in the relative importance of the drivers of job satisfaction, such as work environment, personality, and demographics, across employee subgroups. We also find that the threshold level of the terminal satisfaction for exiting employees could be high for some and low for others. These findings stand in contrast to the inverse satisfaction-turnover intent link documented for existing employees and provide new explanations for the observed weakness in the relationship. They are also inconsistent with the attraction-selection-attrition model that argues for a convergence in employee dispositions. We suggest that job satisfaction and turnover models can be enhanced by adopting a utility-theoretic perspective that accommodates variations in the structure and threshold levels of terminal satisfaction. To this end, we provide some guidelines for how exiting rather than existing employees can provide an alternative avenue for diagnosing the quitting process and ultimately improving the predictive power of turnover models. Finally, we suggest that the allocation of employee retention resources based on either a common model of job satisfaction, or assuming a monotonic satisfaction-intent relationship, may be inefficient. Instead, we argue for model-based, group-specific retention programs to reduce frontline service employee turnover.","['frontline service employees', 'employee turnover', 'job satisfaction', 'turnover intention', 'employee retention', 'latent class models', 'TURNOVER INTENTIONS', 'VOLUNTARY TURNOVER', 'UNIT-LEVEL', 'MODEL', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'RETENTION', 'STRESS']","['frontline service employees', 'employee turnover', 'job satisfaction', 'employee retention', 'model', 'retention']","['job satisfaction', 'exiting', 'work', 'turnover']",0.25,0.16666666666666666
"The tacit assumption that increased product modularity is associated with advantageous increases in organizational modularity, underlies much of the literature on modularity. Previous empirical investigations of this assumption, few in number, have faced numerous confounding factors and generated conflicting results. I build a causal model for the relationship between product and organizational modularity, which I test using a distinctive empirical setting that controls for confounding factors present in previous studies. I find support for only part of the assumed relationship, showing that modularity is a more multifaceted concept than previously recognized. In particular, increased product modularity enhances reconfigurability of organizations more quickly than it allows firms to move activities out of hierarchy. The paper contributes to the emerging stream of research that focuses on the previously underappreciated costs of designing and maintaining a modular organization.

"P>While researchers continue to debate how firms might attain ambidexterity, recent research demonstrates that top management teams (TMTs) play a pivotal role. We enrich this line of inquiry by specifying a model that blends the effect of the CEO and the TMT on ambidexterity. Specifically, given the importance of networking and building social capital to the access of timely, valuable, and diverse information, we first envision that the CEO's network extensiveness will positively impact ambidexterity. Next, we argue that this impact will be bolstered when the CEO-TMT interactional interface, including communication richness, functional complementarity, and power decentralization, enable the entire TMT to process disparate information demands essential to attaining ambidexterity. We test and find general support for our model using multi-source survey data from 122 small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).","['nan', 'TOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS', 'STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'SELECTIVE PERCEPTION', 'SOCIAL NETWORKS', 'DIVERSITY', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'EXECUTIVES', 'OUTCOMES', 'INTEGRATION']",['top management teams'],"['top management teams', 'sized']",0.5,1.0
"In this paper, we examine two distinct perspectives that explain entrepreneurs' choice of product and geographic location, which determine demand for the output of a start-up and the competition it faces. According to the differentiation perspective, fear of direct competition pushes firms far apart from similar competitors, while benefits of complementary differences pull firms close to dissimilar competitors. According to the agglomeration perspective, spillovers from adjacent competitors pull firms close to similar competitors. Our analysis of multidimensional founding location decisions in the Manhattan hotel industry provides evidence to support a combined perspective in which hoteliers locate new hotels sufficiently close to established hotels that are similar on one product dimension (price) to benefit from agglomeration economies, but different on another product dimension (size), to avoid localized competition and create complementary differences.(.)","['nan', 'SPATIAL COMPETITION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL MORTALITY', 'UNOBSERVED HETEROGENEITY', 'DENSITY DEPENDENCE', 'DYNAMICS', 'MARKETS', 'EVOLUTION', 'LOCATION', 'ENTRY', 'POPULATIONS']",['location'],"['location', 'agglomeration', 'spillovers']",0.3333333333333333,1.0

"The tradability revolution in services has led to a dramatic expansion of offshore outsourcing of services, allowing firms to take advantage of lower production costs in foreign countries. However, production costs alone cannot explain the location determinants of offshore outsourcing of services. In this paper, we argue that minimizing transaction costs is also an important determinant of the location of offshore outsourcing of services. We empirically analyze characteristics of services and characteristics of foreign countries that may impact on transaction costs in an outsourcing relationship and hence determine where services will be outsourced offshore. We derive measures of service characteristics - routineness, complexity and interactiveness - based on the tasks required to provide them. Further, we posit that there are interaction effects between service and country characteristics. Using Bureau of Economic Analysis data on US service outsourcing across 11 types of services to 31 countries between 1992 and 2005, we find that: (1) services that are more routine, less complex or less interactive are outsourced more to foreign countries; (2) services are outsourced more to countries with higher institutional quality and greater cultural proximity; (3) non-routine, complex and interactive services are outsourced relatively more to countries with a better institutional quality.

"In a series of qualitative and quantitative studies, we developed a model of the functions of positive work relationships, with an explicit focus on the role that these relationships play in employee flourishing. Stories that employees told about positive relationships at work revealed that relationships serve a broad range of functions, including the traditionally studied functions of task assistance, career advancement, and emotional support, as well as less studied functions of personal growth, friendship, and the opportunity to give to others. Building on this taxonomy, we validated a scale-the Relationship Functions Inventory-and developed theory suggesting differential linkages between the relationship functions and outcomes indicative of employee flourishing. Results revealed unique associations between functions and outcomes, such that task assistance was most strongly associated with job satisfaction, giving to others was most strongly associated with meaningful work, friendship was most strongly associated with positive emotions at work, and personal growth was most strongly associated with life satisfaction. Our results suggest that work relationships play a key role in promoting employee flourishing, and that examining the differential effects of a taxonomy of relationship functions brings precision to our understanding of how relationships impact individual flourishing.","['nan', 'JOB DESCRIPTIVE INDEX', 'POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL EMPOWERMENT', 'SOCIAL SUPPORT', 'MENTAL-HEALTH', 'WORK', 'SATISFACTION', 'PERSONALITY', 'ATTACHMENTS']","['positive relationships', 'work', 'satisfaction']",['satisfaction'],1.0,0.3333333333333333

"Purpose - This paper aims to report research into emergent supply chain management (SCM) practices in a context in which the imperative for business development requires efficient inter-firm collaboration. It explores the way key supply chain (SC) actors perceive entrepreneurial opportunities and evaluates their SC processes. Design/methodology/approach - A whole chain approach, using qualitative methods, was used to investigate retail, wholesale and production links, with a special focus on small businesses which predominate in the agrifood sector. The methodology used is of vital importance to understand the complexity of the sector and the interdependencies among stakeholders. Findings - Results suggest several SC malfunctions originating in diverse strategic planning practices and different entrepreneurial mentalities which hinder the process of emergence from traditional to more modern chain configurations. The fact that the nature of new opportunities in the agrifood sector (e.g. organics) was poorly understood, obstructs further development of the agrifood sector. Other key findings suggest problematic flows of information within the SC and minimal trust among stakeholders. Research limitations/implications - Sampling constraints suggest that caution should be exercised in extrapolating these conclusions elsewhere. Nonetheless, further investigation using similar approach should be applied in a wider context not only in Greece but also in other similar economies characterized by nascent SCs. Originality/value - The study investigates the entire SC of a vital sector for numerous small-and medium-sized enterprises, with lessons for diverse emerging agribusiness economies. Insights, not only for the direct SC stakeholders but also for policymakers, could serve to unlock the potential of such sectors and also the exploitation of new opportunities in emerging markets which can be stifled by stagnant sectoral structures and conservative business attitudes.","['Agricultural products', 'Food industry', 'Small- to medium-sized enterprises', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'FOOD', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FRAMEWORK', 'SUSTAINABILITY', 'INNOVATIVENESS']","['food', 'management']","['supply chain management', 'agrifood']",0.0,0.0
"Drawing on Identity Control Theory (ICT) and the literature on social identity, we offer a model of the dynamics associated with competing family and business identities brought into conflict by family-business events.

This meta-level identity manages conflict between the family and the business identities, and is formulated and transformed within the family structure. To illustrate the dynamics of the family-business meta-identity, in this article we focus on entrepreneurial opportunities as potentially identity conflict-triggering events and illustrate how and with what impact the meta-identity works to resolve identity conflict at the intersection of family and business so as to expedite the entrepreneurial process.

"Innovation adoption is rarely a short process for consumers; accordingly, recent research has explored adoption as a dynamic process that is characterized by changing patterns, or diffusion, of consumer use of the innovation. This research suggests that adoption is rarely a neutral process and that consumers can experience strong emotions in the initial use of innovations. However, given such emotions, two opposing arguments can be made as to whether the inclusion of emotional responses increases the predictive power of traditional models of diffusion. On the one hand, experienced emotion may simply be a function of gained benefits and, as such, may already be captured in extant models through cognitive assessments of net benefits. On the other hand, and as data from two empirical and longitudinal studies demonstrate, the learning process is potentially emotion generating (independent of net benefits), and this emotion colors product evaluations. The emotional influence is sizable and, importantly, not a straightforward case of easier is better. In this work, the authors present the E-3 (expectation -> emotion -> evaluation) model, which describes how managers can better predict and influence the successful diffusion of complex technological products.","['nan', 'CONSUMER', 'SATISFACTION', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'MODEL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EXPERIENCE', 'DIFFUSION', 'JUDGMENTS', 'PATTERNS']","['consumer', 'model', 'experience', 'diffusion', 'patterns']",['diffusion'],1.0,0.2

Through an examination of 375 Chinese employees from 96 work groups, we used hierarchical generalized linear modeling (HGLM) analyses to test our proposed model. Findings reveal that, even when we control for the effects of leader-member exchange and contingent reward leadership, transformational leadership predicts turnover through quit intentions. In addition, our test of cross-level moderation reveals that transformational leadership can weaken the effect of quit intentions on turnover. Thus, employees are less likely to carry out quit intentions when they have transformational leaders.","['employee turnover', 'transformational leadership', 'hierarchical generalized linear modeling', 'HIERARCHICAL LINEAR-MODELS', 'MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'JOB EMBEDDEDNESS', 'VOLUNTARY TURNOVER', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'EMPLOYEE TURNOVER', 'UNFOLDING MODEL', 'ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTIFICATION', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP']","['transformational leadership', 'hierarchical generalized linear modeling', 'member exchange', 'transformational leadership']","['leadership', 'turnover', 'transformational leadership', 'member exchange', 'intentions']",0.4,0.5

"Opportunity evaluation represents a core aspect of the entrepreneurial process. Prior research suggests that evaluation of new opportunities is influenced by biases rooted in subjective beliefs, values, and assumptions. In the present study, we used stereotype activation theory to propose that respondent gender (men-women), content of stereotype (masculine-feminine), and the manner in which stereotype information is presented (subtle-blatant) interact to influence evaluations of a new business opportunity. We found that both masculine and feminine stereotype activation influenced men and women's evaluation of a business opportunity differently depending upon whether the stereotype was blatantly or subtly activated. Our results indicate that gender stereotype activation can both boost and impede men and women's subsequent actions on entrepreneurial tasks such as opportunity evaluation, depending on the content of the stereotype and the manner in which it is presented.

"A common premise in prior research is that trust increases over time in relationships. Through a meta-analysis of 39 studies, we find that the bivariate correlation between trust and relationship duration (1) is on average positive and small, and (2) varies significantly across studies indicating the presence of unobserved moderators. We therefore build a theoretical framework to specify four different mechanisms-initial bias correction, change in relationship value, identification, and trust-based selection-that may affect the development of trust.

"Adapting the theory of planned behavior to the area of financial choices in family firms, we argue that these choices in family firms are largely affected by family norms, attitude, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intentions. A time-lagged sample, estimated via structural equation modeling of 118 German family firms, supports a behavioral approach to the study of financing decisions. Specifically, we show that family norms and attitude toward external debt and external equity affect behavioral intention to use the respective financing choices, which in turn affects financing behavior. Perceived behavioral control, however, was shown to negatively affect behavioral intentions to use external equity and was positively related to the use of internal funds.

"Both health care practice and academe recognize that organizations should modify their business practices to adopt cocreative behaviors and a service-dominant orientation. However, research has provided little understanding of the organizational culture that supports and facilitates cocreation. Contemporary organizational culture models are constrained from explaining cocreation, as they differentiate between an internal and external focus and do not acknowledge the interconnectedness of all actors across traditional organizational boundaries. This research conceptualizes organizational culture from a service-dominant perspective and provides a framework for a cocreation culture type. It utilizes two case studies in the health care industry, inclusive of 10 in-depth interviews and six focus groups, to conduct a systematic inductive approach to concept development. The findings reveal that a cocreation culture comprises five core cocreation behaviors: coproduction, codevelopment, coadvocacy, colearning, and cogovernance. Additionally, a series of supportive cocreation behaviors stimulate the interactive nature of cocreation: dialogue, shared market intelligence, mutual capability development, and shared decision-making.

"A considerable body of research informs the relationship of product innovativeness with firm and environmental variables as well as the impact of product innovativeness on product financial success. While providing significant insight, the extant literature exhibits conflicting findings that raise questions as to how, specifically, product innovativeness contributes to product financial performance. This study ties together several streams of research related to the product innovativeness construct to enhance understanding of the product innovativeness-product financial performance relationship. The product innovativeness construct is deconstructed by conceptualizing the relationships among three dimensions of product innovativeness: technological discontinuity, marketing discontinuity, and customer discontinuity. Product innovativeness is distinguished from product advantage, and the relationships among product innovativeness dimensions, product advantage, and product financial performance are empirically tested. The results reveal that, indeed, product innovativeness consists of three separate dimensions that exhibit no or moderate correlations with product advantage. Furthermore, product advantage positively and marketing discontinuity negatively influence product financial performance. Finally, the study also examines how project protocols impact the product innovativeness dimensions. Project protocols, also known as product definitions, describe the general parameters a new product should exhibit (i.e., target segments, product functions and features, base technology, pricing, communication and distribution channels, and required resources) as well as the priorities of the general parameters. Because they guide product design and set priorities and have been found to be a dominant driver of product financial performance, project protocols are important. The present study enhances understanding of how project protocols influence the dimensions of product innovativeness, finding that project protocols positively impact product financial performance indirectly through product advantage and marketing discontinuity.","['nan', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'SUCCESS', 'JAPANESE', 'IMPACT', 'MANAGEMENT', 'FAILURE', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PREFERENCES', 'INNOVATIONS', 'INDUSTRIAL']","['success', 'impact']",[],0,0.0
"In recent years, many news providers have begun monetizing online content through paywalls. While the premise behind paywalls is that the subscription revenue can be a new source of income, the externalities that might arise from this pricing change are unclear. The authors study two potential externalities of newspaper paywalls: (1) the effect of a paywall on the engagement of its online reader base and (2) the spillover effect on the print version of the newspaper. The engagement effect considers how the paywall altered the various engagement metrics among light and heavy readers of online news. The spillover effect is likely to arise if readers view print and online versions of a newspaper as substitutes, implying that increasing the price of the latter is likely to increase the demand for the former. Moreover, many newspaper paywalls offer bundles wherein print subscribers are provided free access to the online newspaper. Therefore, the value that a reader derives from the print subscription could be higher after the erection of the paywall. As a result, paywalls are likely to have a positive spillover effect on print subscription and, consequently, circulation. The authors document the sizes of the two externalities for the New York Times paywall and compare them with the direct subscription revenue generated. They comment on implications for newspapers and online content providers that are seeking mechanisms to monetize digital content.","['paywalls', 'newspaper industry', 'monetization', 'digital engagement', 'cross-channel spillovers', 'nan']",['paywalls'],"['online content', 'new york times']",0.0,0.0
"Drawing on patent data for approximately 500 firms over 20 years, we advance recent theory on firm boundaries and test these propositions for the first time. We first provide evidence for the existence of knowledge complementarities between vertically related activities in a firm's value chain by showing that firms face increasing (decreasing) performance in conducting downstream activities (i.e., patent litigation) the less (more) they outsource related upstream activities (i.e., patent filing). We then propose and empirically demonstrate that vertical integration benefits through learning differ from vertical outsourcing costs through forgetting. We show that firms can partly offset these hidden outsourcing costs by sourcing similar upstream products from internal and external suppliers.

"The issue of a published literature not representative of the population of research is most often discussed in terms of entire studies being suppressed. However, alternative sources of publication bias are questionable research practices (QRPs) that entail post hoc alterations of hypotheses to support data or post hoc alterations of data to support hypotheses. Using general strain theory as an explanatory framework, we outline the means, motives, and opportunities for researchers to better their chances of publication independent of rigor and relevance. We then assess the frequency of QRPs in management research by tracking differences between dissertations and their resulting journal publications. Our primary finding is that from dissertation to journal article, the ratio of supported to unsupported hypotheses more than doubled (0.82 to 1.00 versus 1.94 to 1.00). The rise in predictive accuracy resulted from the dropping of statistically nonsignificant hypotheses, the addition of statistically significant hypotheses, the reversing of predicted direction of hypotheses, and alterations to data.

"This article focuses on the locus of recovery (LOR) when failures occur in coproduced services. LOR refers to who contributes to the recovery. Based on the LOR effort, recovery can be classified into three types: firm recovery, joint recovery, and customer recovery. The authors develop a conceptual framework to examine the antecedents, consequences, and moderators of LOR and test the framework using three experiments. They find that the positive effect of customers' self-efficacy on their expectancy to participate in recovery is stronger when they blame themselves for the failure than when they blame the service provider. Joint recovery is most effective in generating favorable service outcomes of satisfaction with recovery and intention for future coproduction. Furthermore, recovery urgency strengthens the effect of LOR; however, when a customer's preferred recovery strategy is offered, such matching offsets the impact of recovery urgency. Our findings suggest several managerial implications for devising recovery strategies for service failures. Although having customers do the recovery may appear to be cost-effective, when customers are under time pressure, pushing them toward customer recovery against their preferences is likely to backfire. If a firm's only available option is customer recovery, they should consider increasing customers' sense of autonomy under resource constraints by aligning available recovery options with customer preferences. In contrast, joint recovery can be a win-win strategythe customer is satisfied and the firm uses only moderate resources. It is also a more robust strategy that works particularly well under resource constraints and regardless of preference matching.","['locus of recovery', 'customer participation', 'self-efficacy', 'recovery urgency', 'attribution of failure', 'service recovery', 'coproduction', 'cocreation', 'CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCE', 'TIME PRESSURE', 'SELF-EFFICACY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'RESOURCE', 'ATTRIBUTIONS', 'SATISFACTION', 'CREATION']","['locus of recovery', 'self efficacy', 'recovery urgency', 'coproduction', 'time pressure', 'self efficacy', 'resource', 'satisfaction']","['self efficacy', 'satisfaction', 'urgency', 'service failures']",0.5,0.25

The authors investigate the role of ambient temperature in one important decision-making context: consumer purchase. More specifically, they examine how ambient temperature influences consumers' willingness to pay in different kinds of purchase contexts, such as in auctions and in negotiations. The authors show that whereas higher (vs. moderate) temperatures elicit higher willingness to pay in auctions, they lead to a lower willingness to pay in negotiations, and temperature-induced discomfort and aggression underlie these effects. The authors also study the effects of lower temperatures and extend these findings to more general competitive settings.

"Although knowledge spillovers between firms play a critical role in the evolution of technology, we know little about such spillovers. How does knowledge flow across company boundaries? How do industry characteristics and national institutions shape knowledge diffusion? To what extent do companies direct knowledge flows' This study seeks answers to these questions by examining knowledge sharing patterns in the semiconductor industry. The research shows that public sources of technical data play a larger role in knowledge diffusion in Japan than in the United States and in semiconductors relative to steel. By understanding the mechanisms and determinants of knowledge flows, company managers and public policy makers can influence knowledge diffusion more effectively.","['knowledge sharing and spillovers', 'knowledge management', 'semiconductor industry', 'TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER', 'COOPERATION']",['semiconductor industry'],['diffusion'],0.0,0.0
"Trust is an important factor for managing transaction costs within interorganizational relationships (IORs). Research on trust indicates that separate dimensions of trust arise from a partner's competence (i.e., technical skills, experience, and reliability) and integrity (i.e., motives, honesty, and character), and that these dimensions have potentially unique effects. Because scholars rarely apply this distinction within IOR research, past studies may have masked important relationships involving competence- and integrity-based trust. In response, we build and test theory that explains how competence- and integrity-based trust have asymmetric effects on different kinds of transaction costs. In particular, we build on theory that describes how parties process positive and negative information about others' behavior to predict that integrity-based trust in IORs is more potent for reducing transaction costs than is competence-based trust. We also theorize that building strong IORs requires more up-front investment with competence-based but not with integrity-based trust. By applying meta-analytic structural equation modeling to data on 37,366 IORs drawn from 150 samples, we find that integrity-based trust is about 10 times more effective at reducing these costs. A key implication is that managers seeking to improve the efficiency of their IORs may do well by performing competently, but they can do even better by building perceptions of integrity.","['trust', 'interorganizational relationships', 'meta-analysis', 'transaction costs', 'competence and integrity', 'RELATIVE IMPORTANCE', 'TRANSACTION COSTS', 'FORMAL CONTRACTS', 'PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS', 'ALLIANCE GOVERNANCE', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'PERSON PERCEPTION', 'COOPERATION', 'SUSPICION', 'STRATEGY']","['trust', 'interorganizational relationships', 'transaction costs', 'competence and integrity', 'transaction costs']","['trust', 'transaction costs']",1.0,0.4

"In this paper, we advance and test the idea that innovation and export are complementary strategies for SMEs' growth. We argue that innovation and export positively reinforce each other in a dynamic virtuous circle, and we identify and describe the process through which this complementarity relationship takes place. Participating in export markets can promote firms' learning, and thus enhance innovation performance. At the same time, through innovation, firms can enter new geographical markets with novel and better products, therefore making exports more successful, and, by the same token, they can also improve the quality - and consequently increase the sales of the products sold domestically. We test our theory using an unbalanced panel of Spanish manufacturing firms over the period 1990-1999. We find robust empirical support for our hypothesis: consistent with the presence of complementarity, we show that the positive effect of innovation activity on firms' growth rate is higher for firms that also engage in exports, and vice versa. Furthermore, we show that, Ceteris paribus, firms' adoption of one growth strategy (e.g., entering export markets) positively influences the adoption of the other (e.g., innovation).

"Art enduring challenge for franchise management involves the reconciliation of (1) the franchisor's desire for standardization, consistency, and control for the preservation of its goodwill and brand equity, and (2) the franchisee's quest for autonomy, especially because franchises are frequently sold on the platform of be your own boss and have historically attracted would-be franchisees with self-employment histories and strong streaks of independence and autonomy. Building on arguments derived from agency theory, resource dependence theory, the locus of control argument, and the countervailing power premise, the present study attempts to evaluate (I) the interrelationships between the concepts of autonomy and dependence, and (2) the influence of competition, success, experience, and multi-unit ownership as determinants of the various autonomy-dependence perceptions. It is suggested that, contrary to the dominant perspective nested in the markets versus hierarchy dichotomy, which portrays the sentiments of dependence and autonomy as opposing theoretical variables (i.e., they are envisioned to exist only in high-low combinations of these two constructs), even their high-high and low-low combinations can emerge within a franchise setting and that these diverse behavioral settings entail unique management challenges. The empirical portion of the study utilizes data drawn from the franchised channel of fastfood restaurants. The results support the emergence of all four combinations of dependence and autonomy (i.e., the traditional high-low combinations as well as the high-high and low-low combinations), suggesting that behavioral settings of franchises are indeed richer than hitherto imagined It appears that because franchisee-franchisor relationships encompass several domains, they each feel dependent on the other parry in certain domains, and simultaneously autonomous in other domains. The environmental factor of competition, the relationship factor of business success experienced in the franchise system, and the structural factor of multi-unit ownership emerged as significant predictor of dependence and autonomy. Notably, however, the countervailing power argument was not supported by the data. The multi-unit ownership effects were especially strong and provided a more direct test of the alignment of goals and incentives envisioned by agency theory. We conclude by identifying four categories of franchisees with distinct gestalts that franchisors would do well to learn to manage in the spirit of portfolio management.

"Discount negotiations are prevalent in retailing and serve as key instruments for adjusting retail prices to the individual customer. Accurate perception of the importance the customer attaches to price, which the authors label as customer price importance (CPI) sensing, should be critical to retail salespeople's negotiation performance. However, prior research has neither conceptually nor empirically investigated the role of CPI sensing in customer salesperson interactions. Addressing this research void, this study analyzes both antecedents and consequences of salespeople's accurate CPI sensing in discount negotiations with customers. The authors use a four-sources multilevel data set from the B2C automobile retailing context that comprises data on 537 salesperson customer interactions. Results provide evidence that through accurate CPI sensing, salespeople are able to substantially reduce the discounts they grant to customers (on average by $616 per transaction). Moreover, with respect to CPI sensing accuracy, results show that retail salespeople misperceive CPI owing to reliance on heuristic customer cues. (c) 2015 New York University.

"Global procurement of services has been receiving an increasing amount of managerial attention in recent years. Service firms seem to have begun sourcing part of their service activities from abroad in much the same way as manufacturing firms have sourced components and finished goods in the past 30 years. However, little is known about the nature of service sourcing strategy. In this study, we employ a modified transaction-cost analysis to examine empirically the locational (domestic vs, global sourcing) and the ownership (internal vs. external sourcing) aspects of service sourcing strategy. In addition, performance implications on both the locational and ownership aspects of service sourcing are investigated. The results show that, similar to components and finished goods procurement, supplementary services are sourced globally, either internally or externally. Furthermore, the relationship between asset specificity and internal sourcing of supplementary services is moderated by the level of inseparability and transaction frequency. Finally, internal sourcing and foreign sourcing of supplementary services are negatively related to a service's marker performance.

"With the explosive growth of online user-generated content and the desire by marketers to better utilize this space, it is beneficial to understand the viral diffusion of such content and to identify messages that are most likely to achieve popularity. In this paper, we combine network analysis and the diffusion literature to study the spreading of user-generated videos online. We identify three groups of factors that affect diffusion outcomes: network structure, content characteristics, and author characteristics. Using a proportional rates model, we analyze the diffusion of a sample of videos on YouTube. Our results show that it is preferable to have many subscribers who each has a few friends than to have a few subscribers with many connections. Furthermore, a curvilinear relationship exists between subscriber network connectivity and diffusion rate such that diffusion is at its highest under moderate connectivity. Examining content characteristics, we show that entertainment and educational values affect diffusion but production quality does not matter. Moreover, we find that quality as manifested by user ratings influences diffusion more than innate content quality. Not surprisingly, an author's past success carries over to the current content, and content from younger authors is more popular. (C) 2012 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

"This paper examines the variation in performance of incumbents and entrants following the deregulation of prices and entry in the airline industry. Our approach is similar to earlier studies of interfirm performance heterogeneity across industries. Drawing on theories of industry evolution, we hypothesize that the performance of entrants will have higher variance than incumbents. Further, given the opportunities offered by price deregulation, we propose that incumbents will have higher variance in performance under deregulation than in the earlier regime The findings indicate that entrant performance heterogeneity is significantly, greater than incumbent performance heterogeneity following deregulation, but that the variation in performance among incumbents does not significantly change when deregulation occurs. The second result is surprising given the range of service and process innovations that incumbents initiated. These results suggest that the distinction between entrants and incumbents is critical to future studies of performance variation within and across industries.

New ventures often require debt financing but face difficulties convincing lenders of their creditworthiness because of agency problems.

"This study explores the conditions under which shared team task-specific (STTS) experiences in crew-based arrangements may negatively influence team effectiveness. We suggest that the entrained rhythms featured in social entrainment theory act as a dual-edged sword with the potential to generate complacency detriments in addition to the commonly cited synchronization benefits. We argue that the manifestation and influence of the countervailing forces (i.e., synchronization and complacency) on the STTS experience-team effectiveness relationship will depend on salient task characteristics (i.e., frequency and difficulty). More specifically, frequently performed tasks create conditions for complacency tomanifest (generating an inverted-U shaped relationship between STTS experience-team efficiency), whereas infrequently performed tasks do not (generating a positive, linear relationship). We further this distinction by layering on task difficulty that, we posit, acts to amplify the respective negative and positive consequences.

"We develop a psychological perspective on managers' exploration orientation. Our study suggests that the regulatory focus of managers may in different ways, impact their orientation toward search, risk-taking, and experimentation. Moreover, we argue that these relationships are contingent not only on the extent to which the organizational context fits with the motivational disposition of managers, but also on the complexity of decision-making. Using an experimental setting, we find that managers' regulatory focus affects their willingness to experiment with a wide range of alternatives and to deviate from existing best practices. Moreover, the promotion focus of managers heightens their exploration orientation in an organizational context with promotion-focused cues in highly complex decision-making.

"Augmented Reality (AR) holograms are 3D digital objects projected into a customer's physical environment through mobile technology. Applied as potential substitutes to physical products, AR holograms pose a unique challenge for conventional configurations of product ownership. Taking a socially situated cognition perspective, we demonstrate how customers' shared experience of AR holograms leads to distinct perspectives on psychological ownership. In Study 1, we demonstrate how customization of AR holograms lets customers feel psychological ownership of digital products. In Study 2, we highlight the mechanisms of social adaptation related to assimilation and differentiation that drive the relationship between customization and psychological ownership of AR holograms in social settings. In Study 3, we illustrate how these mechanisms are influenced by the affordances of AR technology when customers switch between personal or shared devices.

"Research summary A fundamental question in stakeholder strategy research is why firms adopt certain strategies or approaches to engage with key stakeholders. Recent research suggests that CEOs' characteristics can influence their general decisions to engage with stakeholders, however, this work has yet to consider why CEOs might utilize specific stakeholder strategies. In this article, we demonstrate how CEO regulatory focus influences the nature of a firm's stakeholder strategy. Specifically, we argue that CEO prevention focus is positively associated with engagement in governance-oriented initiatives and receptivity to governance-oriented stakeholder activism, while CEO promotion focus is positively associated with engagement in socially-oriented initiatives and receptivity to socially-oriented stakeholder activism. We find strong support for our hypotheses in a sample of 374 publicly-traded firms. Managerial summary The strategies a firm uses to engage with stakeholders can influence its performance, yet little is known about what makes firms focus on certain stakeholders over others. To better understand this, we examined CEO regulatory focus in a sample of large public companies. Our findings reveal that the way CEOs view decisions-either based on a sense of duty, obligations, and responsibility or as a means to achieve high ideals-influences their tendency to prioritize shareholder concerns or the concerns of a broader array of stakeholders. This suggests that executives should be aware of their own natural tendencies to inject their motivations into their firm's stakeholder strategy and consider avenues to balance their perspectives for the sake of the firm.","['CEO decision-making', 'corporate social responsibility', 'regulatory focus theory', 'stakeholder strategy', 'upper echelons theory', 'CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMISM', 'SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM', 'INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS', 'TEMPORAL FOCUS', 'MEDIA COVERAGE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'GOVERNANCE', 'PREVENTION']","['stakeholder strategy', 'performance', 'governance', 'prevention']","['stakeholder strategy', 'ceos', 'ceo prevention', 'performance']",0.5,0.5
"Research suggests that employees who perceive interpersonal injustice in their workplace are more likely to engage in workplace deviance. However, researchers have seldom considered the role of personal values in shaping behavioral reactions to perceived injustice. This article investigates the moderating influence of justice-related values on reactions to perceived injustice.

"Sensorimotor experiences of going against the flow can affect the choices consumers make. Eight experiments show that consumers who experience the sensation of going against the flow pick alternatives that are normatively not preferred (experiments 1a and 1b). These effects are evident only when the sensations are dynamic and self-experienced (experiments 2a and 2b), subjective feelings are elicited (experiments 4a and 4b), and no other objective, external norm information is supplied (experiment 5). Experiences of going against the flow typically involve both movement and direction and are represented in memory schematically. Re-experiencing these sensations leads to the activation of this schematic representation and elicits a feeling-based behavioral disposition to do something different, or to go against one's initial inclination (experiment 3), leading participants to pick an option that is normatively not preferred.","['sensory motor experiences', 'embodied cognition', 'choice', 'affect', 'norms', 'SOCIAL-INFLUENCE', 'INTERPERSONAL TOUCH', 'GROUNDED COGNITION', 'EMBODIED COGNITION', 'BRAND EVALUATION', 'SELF', 'JUDGMENTS', 'ATTITUDES', 'BEHAVIOR', 'IMAGERY']","['choice', 'affect', 'self', 'behavior']",['choices'],0.0,0.0
"The use of subcontracting within the construction industry has become commonplace with many main contractors only undertaking the management and co-ordination activities. The reliance on subcontractors has put much stress on the main contractor-subcontractor relationship. As main contractors have realised that the greatest potential for cost savings lies with the subcontractors, the prevalence of unfair practices has increased. This paper describes a procurement approach, utilising limited competition, developed by a major UK main contractor in order to improve its relationships with subcontractors. The approach developed was based on research which identified: what the main contractor's professional employees want from subcontractors; what subcontractors want from main contractors; and a study to compare the main contractor's performance with that of its competitors. It was concluded that this approach offers a number of benefits for the client, the main contractor, partnering subcontractors and professional consultants, such as, lower costs, improved team approach and less confrontation.","['partnering', 'construction industry', 'contract labour', 'subcontracting', 'MODEL']","['partnering', 'construction industry', 'subcontracting']","['subcontracting', 'construction', 'procurement', 'professional employees', 'confrontation']",0.2,0.3333333333333333
"How are breakthrough innovations created? Our study suggests that the type of external knowledge sourced determines the likelihood of creation of breakthrough innovation. We characterize the external knowledge utilized on two dimensions: its technological space and geographic origin. We draw on the concepts of local search and national innovation systems to identify critical knowledge inputs. We hypothesize that external knowledge characterized by technological distance or proximity and the national or international context can have a differential impact on breakthrough innovation. This is due to the contradictory implications of its value created by distance and to absorptive capacity limitations in effectively utilizing knowledge from a different context. To test our hypotheses we use patent data from the U.S. biotechnology industry. Our findings suggest that technologically distant knowledge of national origin has a curvilinear effect and technologically proximate knowledge of international origin has a positive effect on breakthrough innovation. However, simultaneous exploration along technologically and geographic dimensions is not useful to generating breakthrough innovation; technologically distant knowledge of international origin does not have a significant impact.

"Although marketers increasingly rely upon cause-related marketing strategies to increase sales, controversy exists regarding whether a retailer should partner with causes offering high or low fit levels with its core business practices. The present investigation extends prior research by examining how retailer-cause fit affects consumer evaluations of retailers' cause-related marketing strategies. The results indicate that the effects of retailer-cause fit are moderated by consumer perceptions of the retailer's motive for engaging in cause-related marketing (Study 1), by the affinity that consumers hold for the social cause component of the campaign (Study 2), as well as by the interactive effects associated with the two moderators (Study 3).

"To identify and substantiate the correlates and antecedents of new venture performance, it is requisite to identify the most relevant performance dimensions and move toward the use of common measures of performance. Relevant, reliable, and valid measures of new venture performance are essential to explore vital relationships between independent variables and venture success and develop sound venture performance theory. In this paper we discuss three of the most common measurement approaches used in new venture performance research when only self-report data are available, and present a comparison of these approaches: (1) measuring firm performance in broadly defined categories, (2) the use of subjective measures of executive or owner satisfaction with firm performance, and (3) the use of subjective measures of firm performance relative to competitors. After discussing the relevance and potential benefits and drawbacks of each approach we use empirical data to examine and compare the availability, reliability, and relative validity of measures developed using these approaches. The sample consisted of manufacturing businesses (SIC codes 20-39) started or reorganized in the corporate form between 1980 and 1991 in nine counties in northwestern Pennsylvania, as identified by a major marketing research service. Questionnaires were returned by primary respondents in 120 companies; complete matching firm performance data from a second respondent were returned for 45 of the firms. The pattern of results favors the use of two dimensions of venture performance: growth and business volume. The growth and business volume measures operationalized in this research have good availability and internal consistency and are superior to the satisfaction with performance and performance relative to conspetitors' scales in terms of content validity. Evidence of the external validity of the measures is provided by regression analysis showing independent variables indentified and substantiated by previous research to be related to performance in the hypothesized manner. The satisfaction with performance index had a high disclosure rate, strong internal consistency, and relatively strong inter-rater reliability. There is little evidence supporting its external validity. With the exception of its negative relationship with the level of competition, none of the predicted relationships are substantiated. The performance relative to competitors' disclosure rate was somewhat lower as was the inter-rater reliability; however, it emerged as a strong independent construct with a high level of internal consistency. There was evidence for the external validity of this measure. The independent variables related to the performance relative to competitors' index are similar to those related to both the growth and business volume dimensions as predicted from previous theoretical work and research findings. In summary, this research makes several contributions to the new venture performance literature. First, when researchers are required to use self-reported measures of venture performance, growth and business volume are the dimensions of performance most familiar to and most commonly referenced by the founders. Second, it provides additional evidence for the accuracy and reliability of founder reported performance data. Third, it provides examples of specific measures with evidence that supports their relevance, availability, reliability, and validity. We believe this research can provide a base for future venture performance research. We hope that these findings will be used to help better our understanding of the dynamics impacting new venture performance and lead to improved managerial practice in emerging firms.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'VENTURE PERFORMANCE', 'FIRMS', 'STRATEGIES', 'INDUSTRY', 'GROWTH', 'UNIT']","['venture performance', 'firms', 'growth']",[],0,0.0
"Research Summary: Despite the prevalence of CEO dismissal, theory only briefly explores its consequences. Past research indicates few fired CEOs regain employment. We suggest dismissal stigmatizes executives; however, stigmatization is greatest when character questioning causal accounts exist, which affect the likelihood of regaining a CEO position. Furthermore, we argue that reputational and social capital provide signals of executive quality that moderate the level of stigmatization experienced when character questioning causal accounts exist. Following 280 dismissed CEOs, we find that social capital increases the likelihood of rehiring for those with character questioning causal accounts, but negatively impacts those without causal accounts. Alternatively, we find reputational capital positively influences those without causal accounts, while having a slight negative relationship for those with causal accounts. Managerial Summary: Dismissed CEOs often desire second chances to run companies; however, few are ever afforded the opportunity. We explore what allows some dismissed CEOs to regain employment as a CEO. We find that reasons surrounding a CEO's dismissal influence such prospects depending on the CEO's prior reputation and social capital. In particular, social capital through elite education increases the likelihood of regaining a position when the CEO's character is called into question. Alternatively, a strong reputation increases the likelihood of regaining a CEO position when a CEO's character has not been called into question. These findings suggest that dismissed CEOs can regain a CEO position; however, this likelihood is strongly influenced by how others perceive the executive and their concerns about prior behavior.","['CEO dismissal', 'executive labor markets', 'reputation', 'social capital', 'stigmatization', 'MANAGEMENT TURNOVER', 'ORGANIZATIONAL REPUTATION', 'CERTIFICATION CONTESTS', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'FIRM', 'PERFORMANCE', 'BANKRUPTCY', 'COMPENSATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'DEPENDENCE']","['ceo dismissal', 'reputation', 'social capital', 'stigmatization']",['ceo dismissal'],1.0,0.25
"This research examines one aspect of the common but relatively understudied consumer behavior context of group interaction. We argue and demonstrate that the mere anticipation of group discussion can influence people's product attitudes. This occurs because anticipating discussion shifts people's focus toward the criteria dominating what they are mentally rehearsing to discuss. Such a shift is important because people commonly refer primarily to less important information when they explain or prepare to discuss their attitudes. Three studies demonstrate that when people are forming an attitude toward a product while anticipating discussion, this focus on less important information substantially affects people's attitudes toward the product. As a result, depending on the evaluative implications of what is rehearsed, anticipating group discussion can lead to attitudes that are more extreme, more moderate, or similar to those of people not anticipating discussion. Moreover, when the criteria predominantly rehearsed for discussion do not represent how consumers typically evaluate the products, attitudes affected by the group-anticipation context do not correspond to product judgments made outside of the group-anticipation context.","['nan', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'ATTITUDE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'REASONS', 'INFORMATION', 'PREFERENCES', 'COMPLEXITY', 'CHOICE', 'REDUCE']","['attitude', 'behavior', 'information']","['information', 'judgments']",0.5,0.3333333333333333
"How are price judgments influenced by the distribution of observed prices for other items in the same category? Processing goals will moderate price-judgment processes. When the processing goal is discrimination, price perceptions will be influenced by variations in range and ranks of prices in a distribution and contrast effects will be observed. For example, lowering the price of the lowest-priced product in a set will increase perceived expensiveness of higher-priced products. When the processing goal is generalization, however, price perceptions will be influenced by variations in the mean of the price distribution, in which case assimilation is observed. For example, lowering the price of the lowest-priced product in a set will decrease perceived expensiveness of higher-priced products. This latter finding is in sharp contrast to findings in the current literature on the effect of price structure on price judgments.","['nan', 'RANGE-FREQUENCY MODEL', 'SOCIAL JUDGMENT', 'CLASSIFICATION', 'INFERENCE', 'INFORMATION', 'CATEGORIES', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'SIMILARITY', 'CHOICE', 'IDEALS']",['perceptions'],"['judgments', 'assimilation']",0.0,0.0
"In this article we examine project-level and team-level managerial functions aimed at managing inter-team task interdependencies and investigate their effect on the performance of teams in a multi-team product development project. We hypothesize that team interface management (a team-level function) performed in the concept phase of a project, rather than the later development phase, is positively related to team performance at the project's conclusion (i.e. product quality, product cost, development budget, development time). Furthermore, we argue that project structuring and support (a project-level function) is important in both the concept and the development phases. We test our hypotheses empirically based on a 36 months longitudinal study of a product development project in the European automotive industry comprising 39 teams. The results show that team interface management is particularly important during the concept phase of the project. Project structuring and support is most important in the development phase of the project, while hindering team performance in the concept phase.

"Although interest in smart shopping carts is increasing, both retailers and consumer groups have concerns about how real-time spending feedback will influence shopping behavior. Building on budgeting and spending theories, the authors conduct three lab and grocery store experiments that robustly show that real-time spending feedback has a diverging impact on spending depending on whether a person is budget constrained (budget shoppers) or not (nonbudget shoppers). Real-time spending feedback stimulates budget shoppers to spend more (by buying more national brands). In contrast, this feedback leads nonbudget shoppers to spend less (by replacing national brands with store brands). Furthermore, smart shopping carts increase repatronage intentions for budget shoppers while keeping them stable for nonbudget shoppers. These findings underscore fundamental unexplored differences between budget and nonbudget shoppers. Moreover, they have key implications for both brick-and-mortar and online retailers as well as app developers.","['real-time spending feedback', 'grocery shopping behavior', 'smart shopping carts', 'budget shoppers', 'nonbudget shoppers', 'CONSUMER CHOICE', 'LOSS AVERSION', 'STORE BRANDS', 'PRICE', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'SEARCH', 'MODEL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PURCHASE']","['real time spending feedback', 'smart shopping carts', 'budget shoppers', 'nonbudget shoppers', 'store brands', 'behavior']","['smart shopping carts', 'budgeting', 'national brands']",0.3333333333333333,0.16666666666666666
"This paper develops a contingency view regarding the effects of structural differentiation and integration on levels of corporate entrepreneurship. Integrating notions of benefits and costs resulting from integration with structural contingency theory, we argue that the joint effects of structural differentiation and integration on corporate entrepreneurship levels are moderated by organizational size and environmental dynamism. Our findings from a time-separated sample demonstrate that in smaller organizations and more dynamic environments, the positive effects of integration on the structural differentiation-corporate entrepreneurship relationship strongly diminish. As such, with this research we begin to identify contingencies that influence the corporate entrepreneurship levels observed among firms striving to balance the needs for structural differentiation and integration.

"This paper critically reviews the field of international business research. The field is characterized by considerable intellectual diversity, where theoretical focus is blurred by the multidisciplinary nature of the field. The review focuses on three themes that help shed light on internationalization as a strategy process; stage models of internationalization, studies of the link between strategy and structure in MNCs, and studies of administrative processes in MNCs and recent organizational models for MNCs. Sequential stages models are too deterministic and stress only early stages of internationalization. Conceptual contributions from research on structures following strategies have a very static character. Research on management processes in MNCs have a questionable empirical base and normative bent. Three key themes for future research on internationalization as a process are suggested. These themes, dealing with major omissions and weaknesses identified in the review, are: the study of acquisition processes and internationalization, the study of dynamic processes in MNCs, and the study of internationalization processes in their outer contexts.","['INTERNATIONALIZATION', 'STRATEGY PROCESS', 'MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION', 'STAGE MODELS', 'GLOBAL INTEGRATION', 'LOCAL RESPONSIVENESS', 'ACQUISITION', 'DIFFERENTIATION', 'LONGITUDINAL APPROACH', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'FOLLOWS STRUCTURE', 'EVOLUTION', 'INTERNALIZATION', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'COORDINATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ENTERPRISE', 'EXPANSION', 'BUSINESS']","['internationalization', 'strategy process', 'stage models', 'acquisition', 'management', 'business']",[],0,0.0

"This research examines a condition under which supervisor undermining is related to perceptions of leader hypocrisy that then lead to employee turnover intentions. Drawing on behavioral integrity theory and arguments from the social cognition literature, the authors argue that subordinates compare supervisor undermining to an interpersonal justice expectation, as a salient social cue, to draw conclusions regarding leader hypocrisy. In turn, the cognitive conclusion that the leader is indeed a hypocrite generates uncertainty that subordinates are motivated to manage by increasing turnover intentions. The authors examine perceptions of leader hypocrisy as the mediator of their proposed theoretical model while controlling for psychological contract breach and trust in supervisor.

"Research summary: When war occurs in a country, some foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) stay on, while others flee. We argue that MNE responses to external threats depend on the firm's vulnerability, which we decompose into exposure (proximity to threat), at-risk resources (potential for loss), and resilience (capacity for coping). We test the independent and interactive effects of these dimensions using a geo-referenced sample of 1,162 MNE subsidiaries in 20 war-afflicted countries between 1987 and 2006. We find that highly valuable resources can become liabilities when exposed to harm, and the best way to cope with external threats may be to exit. Our findings extend the resource-based view and real options theory by demonstrating the bounded value of resources and options in the face of environmental contingencies.Managerial summary: A recent survey of multinational enterprise (MNE) executives revealed that 30 percent of the respondents believed that their firms were exposed to collateral damage from war, with more than 90 percent expecting risks to rise. Yet, 25 percent of the executives indicated that their firms had no continuity plan. Our study of MNEs in war-afflicted countries highlights the costs of not having a response strategy in place. We find that, in war zones, otherwise highly valuable locations and resources can become sources of vulnerability that prompt early withdrawal from a host country. Our work further highlights the value of real options thinkingwhere structural solutions such as building redundancy into a portfolio of options may exist in advance of problemsfor navigating hostile environments.

"A hedonic contrast effect occurs when comparing a stimulus to its alternatives makes it better or worse. We find that counterfactual comparisons induce larger hedonic contrast effects when they are also social comparisons. Hedonic contrast effects influence happiness with a food or wage more when another person receives its counterfactual alternative than when no person receives its counterfactual alternative. Social attention, the propensity to attend to the experiences of other people, underlies the larger hedonic contrast effects induced by social comparisons. People pay more attention to counterfactual alternatives when they are also social comparison standards, and this difference in the allocation of attention mediates the larger hedonic contrast effects that social counterfactual comparisons induce. Reducing attentional resources with cognitive load or time pressure reduces the impact of social counterfactual comparisons, and drawing attention to nonsocial counterfactual comparisons increases their impact. Social attention makes comparisons stronger when they are social.","['social comparison', 'hedonic contrast effects', 'social attention', 'counterfactual thinking', 'affect', 'COUNTERFACTUAL THINKING', 'EMOTIONAL-REACTIONS', 'INCOME INEQUALITY', 'IMPACT BIAS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'ATTENTION', 'DIRECTION', 'DECISION', 'SELF', 'LESS']","['social comparison', 'hedonic contrast effects', 'social attention', 'attention']","['comparisons', 'happiness', 'social attention']",0.3333333333333333,0.25
"This meta-analysis combines 369 correlations on the effects of humor in advertising and thus quantifies, updates, and expands previous literature reviews on the effects of humor in advertising. In line with previous reviews, the meta-analytic correlations demonstrate that humor in advertising significantly enhances A(AD), attention, and positive affect. Contrary to the assumptions of previous reviews, there is no evidence that humor impacts positive or negative cognitions, and liking of the advertiser. The meta-analytic findings clarify some ambiguous prior conclusions: humor significantly reduces source credibility, enhances positive affect, A(BR) and purchase intention. The decline from lower order to higher order communication effects is particularly strong, with the effect size of the impact of humor on A(AD) being twice as large as the effect size for A(BR). This impact of humor in advertising has been rather stable over the past decades. A moderator analysis reveals, however, that the findings of academic humor research are somewhat biased. As for the underlying theory, the positive and linear relationship between the funniness of the ad and brand attitudes supports an affective mechanism underlying the impact of humor in advertising.","['Humor in advertising', 'Meta-analysis', 'Generalization', 'PROGRAM CONTEXT', 'META-ANALYSIS', 'IMPACT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'RESPONSES', 'ATTITUDE', 'MODEL', 'AD', 'ADVERTISEMENTS', 'ANTECEDENTS']","['humor in advertising', 'meta analysis', 'meta analysis', 'impact', 'attitude', 'ad']","['meta analysis', 'humor', 'advertising', 'attention', 'positive affect', 'source credibility', 'communication']",0.14285714285714285,0.16666666666666666
"Consumer research commonly conceptualizes consumer acculturation as a project that immigrants pursue when adjusting their consumer identities and practices to unfamiliar sociocultural environments. This article broadens this prevailing view by conceptualizing consumer acculturation as a relational, interactive adaptation process that involves not only immigrant consumption practices but also indigenes who interpret and adjust to these practices, thereby shaping the paths of possibility for mutual adaptation. Based on a Fiskenian relational configuration analysis, the study shows how indigenes in a rural European town interpret certain immigrant consumption practices as manifestations of a gradual sell-out of the indigenous community, a crumbling of their authority, a violation of equality rules, and of indigenes being torn between contradictory micro-and macro-social morals.

"We develop a behavioural framework of bounded rational decision-making under uncertainty to analyse the role of technological dynamism in the firm's environment for its decision to internationalise innovation. Applying prospect theory, we argue that technological uncertainty in the firm's environment affects its risk preferences differently depending on its technological capabilities. A key prediction is that firms with low capabilities will internationalise innovation when faced by technological uncertainty while firms with high capabilities will concentrate their innovation at the home-base. We also argue that our behavioural approach based on prospect theory is not a stand-alone programme but benefits from the integration with traditional concepts in IB. In particular, we make a case that organisational measures fostering absorptive capacity, such as intensive personnel exchange between headquarters and subsidiaries, can help to attenuate the high-capability firms' tendency to concentrate innovation at the home-base when faced by high uncertainty. We corroborate the predictions of our framework based on data from the German part of the Community Innovation Survey.","['internationalisation of innovation', 'speed of technological change', 'bounded rationality', 'prospect theory', 'uncertainty', 'technological capabilities', 'limited dependent variable regression', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'HIGH-VELOCITY ENVIRONMENTS', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'OFFSHORING STRATEGY', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'MODEL', 'IMPACT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INFORMATION']","['prospect theory', 'uncertainty', 'technological capabilities', 'absorptive capacity', 'decision making']","['decision making', 'innovation', 'prospect theory', 'absorptive capacity', 'survey']",0.6,0.6
"While the beneficial impacts of supplier and customer integration are generally acknowledged, very few empirical research studies have examined how an organization can achieve better product performance through product innovation enhanced by such integration. This paper thus examines the impact of key supplier and customer integration processes (i.e., information sharing and product codevelopment with supplier and customer, respectively) on product innovation as well as their impact on product performance. It contributes to existing literature by asking how such integration activities affect product innovation and performance in both direct and indirect ways. After surveying 251 manufacturers in Hong Kong, this study tested the relationships among information sharing, product codevelopment, product innovativeness, and performance with three control variables (i.e., company size, type of industry, and market certainty). Structural equation modeling with correlation and t-tests was used to test the hypothesized research model. The findings indicate a direct, positive relationship between supplier and customer integration and product performance. In particular, this study verifies that sharing information with suppliers and product codevelopment with customers directly improves product performance. In addition, this study empirically examines the indirect effects of supplier and customer integration processes on product performance, mediated by innovation. This has seldom been attempted in previous research. The empirical findings show that product codevelopment with suppliers improves performance, mediated by innovation. However, the sampled firms cannot improve their product innovation by sharing information with their current customers and suppliers as well as codeveloping new products with the customers. If the adoption of supplier and customer integration is not cost free, the findings of this study may suggest firms work on particular supplier and customer integration processes (i.e., product codevelopment with suppliers) to improve their product innovation. The study also suggests that companies codevelop new products only with new customers and lead users instead of current ones for product innovation. For managers, this study has demonstrated that both information sharing and product codevelopment affect performance directly and indirectly. Managers should put more emphasis on these key processes, especially when linked with product innovation. Managers should consider involving their suppliers and customers in the early stages of design. Information sharing with suppliers is also important in product development. As suggested by this study, extensive effort on supplier and customer integration should be made to directly augment current product performance and product innovation at the same time.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL INTEGRATION', 'TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'CHAIN', 'CAPABILITIES', 'STRATEGY', 'INFORMATION', 'IMPACT', 'MODEL', 'DIVERSIFICATION']","['information', 'impact', 'model']",[],0,0.0
"FDI research has presented consistent evidence that firm experience moderates the effect of risk on entry in a new foreign market. This conclusion is contested by recent research. By revisiting the conceptualisation of risk by economists and behaviourists, we show that the proposed learning mechanism only applies to endogenous risk, not exogenous risk. As assessing endogenous risk involves self-evaluation of risk-reducing capability, it is posited that firms have differential tendencies to take such risks even when experience and ownership are accounted for. We find both observed and unobserved variations in firms' responses to endogenous risk, as opposed to exogenous risk.","['Location choice', 'Experience', 'Political risk', 'FDI', 'Behavioural theory', 'FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'LOCATION CHOICE', 'INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS', 'INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT', 'JAPANESE FIRMS', 'POLITICAL RISK', 'HOME COUNTRY', 'EXPERIENCE', 'STRATEGY', 'MANAGEMENT']","['experience', 'fdi', 'experience']",[],0,0.0

"This paper investigates how foreign ownership shapes bank information environments. Using a sample of listed banks from 60 countries over 1997-2012, we show that foreign ownership is significantly associated with greater (lower) informativeness (synchronicity) in bank stock prices. We also find that stock returns of foreign-owned banks reflect more information about future earnings. In addition, the positive association between price informativeness and foreign ownership is stronger for foreign-owned banks in countries with stronger governance, stronger banking supervision, and lower monitoring costs. Overall, our evidence suggests that foreign ownership reduces bank opacity by exporting governance, yielding important implications for regulators and governments.","['multiple regression analysis', 'agency theory', 'internationalization theories and foreign market entry', 'international financial integration', 'foreign bank ownership', 'stock price synchronicity', 'INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS', 'INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS', 'PRICE INFORMATIVENESS', 'MARKET DISCIPLINE', 'EMERGING MARKETS', 'RISK', 'FIRM', 'RETURN', 'EARNINGS', 'BOARD']","['price informativeness', 'return', 'earnings']","['foreign ownership', 'information', 'informativeness', 'governance']",0.0,0.0

"At the pinnacles of organizations, comparative tests of unity of command and shared command are nearly impossible because only one individual sits atop most organizations. In organizations led by co-CEOs, however, such a test is possible because co-CEOs can truly share power. But do they? Our research pits the unity-of-command principle against the shared-command principle and finds overall support for the former, even within the co-CEO context. Our sample of 71 co-CEO pairs at publicly traded U.S. firms shows that increasing power gaps between co-CEOs are positively associated with firm performance. This positive association wanes and turns negative, however, as power gaps become very large. We conclude that whatever benefits the co-CEO structure might offer likely lie outside the shared command paradigm.

In this study, a new moderating variable called target-arousal level was introduced to advance our understanding of the role of pleasure and arousal in the satisfaction evaluation process. The results from our experimental study indicate that the traditional pleasure-arousal interaction effect (e.g., Mehrabian and Russell, 1974) might be limited to high target arousal situations. Optimal arousal theories (e.g., Berlyne, 1960), on the other hand, might offer a fruitful framework for the satisfaction-arousal link in low target arousal environments.","['nan', 'BACKGROUND MUSIC', 'CONSUMPTION EXPERIENCE', 'PHYSICAL SURROUNDINGS', 'STORE ATMOSPHERE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'RESPONSES', 'JUDGMENTS', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'VARIABLES']",['environment'],[],0,0.0
"Once a preferred strategy, corporate diversification into disparate lines of business has gradually declined in the U.S. over the past several decades. We argue that changes that occurred in a closely related domain-graduate business education-are important in understanding variation in de-diversification across firms. Building on a historical account of the transformation of business education, we explain how the rise of financial economics and agency-theoretic logic in business education changed students' views about diversification. Nearly 20 years later, these MBA graduates rose to top decision-making positions and put the brakes on diversification. Using data on CEOs who ran 640 large U.S. corporations from 1985 to 2015, we show that CEOs who earned an MBA before the 1970s actively pursued diversification, whereas the next cohort of CEOs, who had been exposed to agency-theoretic logic in financial economics, refrained from it. We also demonstrate that the degree of managerial discretion moderated the effect of the CEO's MBA education. Our study shows that institutional change in one domain (i.e., business education) contributed to change in another domain (i.e., corporate diversification), albeit with a considerable time lag.","['institutional change', 'corporate diversification', 'graduate business education', 'managerial cognition', 'UNITED-STATES', 'INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES', 'CORPORATE-CONTROL', 'AGENCY COSTS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FIRM', 'STRATEGY', 'FINANCE', 'DIRECTORS']","['institutional change', 'corporate diversification', 'graduate business education', 'firm', 'strategy']","['diversification', 'agency theoretic logic']",0.0,0.0
"Consumers increasingly rely on the Internet to obtain product information and advice from other consumers. However, since the information available on the Internet is easily manipulated, they have to seek cues for the trustworthiness of the online information. The present study proposes and tests the effects on perceived trust of online information and subsequent attitude of (1) perceived strong vs. weak social relationships among net pals and (2) positive vs. negative messages. The moderating effects of credence vs. experience goods are also examined in the research. Results show that, for experience goods, either positive or negative online messages will be perceived as credible as long as the messages are posted by those perceived to have close social relationships. On the other hand, for credence goods, negative online messages are perceived to be more credible than positive online messages when the messages are posted by those perceived to have close social relationships. Results also show the main effect of positive/negative messages on credibility of information, as well as that the effect of credibility of information on product attitude is weaker in the credence goods group than in the experience goods group.

"This article introduces a new dimension of consumption as liquid or solid. Liquid consumption is defined as ephemeral, access based, and dematerialized, while solid consumption is defined as enduring, ownership based, and material. Liquid and solid consumption are conceptualized as existing on a spectrum, with four conditions leading to consumption being liquid, solid, or a combination of the two: relevance to the self, the nature of social relationships, accessibility to mobility networks, and type of precarity experienced. Liquid consumption is needed to explain behavior within digital contexts, in access-based consumption, and in conditions of global mobility. It highlights a consumption orientation around values of flexibility, adaptability, fluidity, lightness, detachment, and speed. Implications of liquid consumption are discussed for the domains of attachment and appropriation; the importance of use value; materialism; brand relationships and communities; identity; prosumption and the prosumer; and big data, quantification of the self, and surveillance.

"Vahlne and Johanson (2017) present the multinational business enterprise(MBE) as a new form of cross-border organization that supersedes the multinational enterprise (MNE). They offer a 'generalmodel of the evolution of the MBE,' arguing that the MBE evolves through ongoing internationalization processes by proactively and entrepreneurially engaging in business exchange rather than production. In this counterpoint, we focus on two critical dimensions absent from Vahlne and Johanson's (2017) arguments: the impact of the digital context as a defining macro-level feature of our modern world, and the role of the individual as a core microfoundation of the internationalization process. We argue that a robust theory of the evolution of the modern firm must necessarily account for these dimensions. To explicate these impacts, we draw from a range of complementary research streams across international business, entrepreneurship, and international entrepreneurship. We identify research implications for scholars seeking to further advance the Uppsala model of internationalization and those who will use the revised model to study the modern multinational.","['internationalization', 'entrepreneurial', 'digital', 'microfoundations', 'Uppsala model', 'INTERNATIONALIZATION PROCESS MODEL', 'OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION', 'INTERNALIZATION THEORY', 'BORN GLOBALS', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'FIRM', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'BUSINESS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'EVOLUTION']","['internationalization', 'entrepreneurial', 'digital', 'uppsala model', 'entrepreneurship', 'firm', 'business', 'evolution']","['multinational business enterprise', 'uppsala model']",0.5,0.125
"This paper provides a critique of existing research on the internationalization process of the firm and proposes an agenda for future inquiry. In recent years, process approaches have received increasing attention in management research, leading to a more refined understanding of the distinction between process and variance paradigms. We apply a process lens to a well-established sub-field of international business, namely the internationalization process of the firm. We review how this research tradition has evolved over four decades. The review commences with a reassessment of the seminal stage models' that date back to the 1970s. It then proceeds to classify subsequent research on the basis of whether it includes process data and/or process theorizing. It is found that the majority of studies in this review do not combine process data with process theorizing. We show how, even in studies that contain some process elements, a process approach is not always sustained throughout the paper. On the basis of this review, six research themes are proposed, which would form the basis for a process agenda for future research.","['nan', 'SME INTERNATIONALIZATION', 'STRATEGY PROCESS', 'ENTRY', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'MARKET', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'NETWORK', 'MODEL', 'SPEED', 'TIME']",['model'],"['internationalization', 'firm', 'process data']",0.0,0.0
"A foreign distributor's motivation to perform local marketing tasks for an exporter is often poor due to agency conflicts and transaction cost constraints characterizing the export channel. While exporters may engage in actions such as offering incentives and overseeing partner activities to improve foreign marketing, such intrusions into partner operations often fail to enhance the distributor's role performance. Drawing on motivation theory, the authors develop a model explaining the efficiency of different incentive types in enhancing the distributor's motivational context to act on behalf of the exporter, thereby improving relationship quality, distributor relationship-specific investments, and, consequently, distributor role performance. The authors use a sample of 278 European exporters to test hypotheses regarding relationship factors that mediate and moderate the incentive-role performance relationship. The results indicate that the impact of low-powered incentives (LPIs) substitutes for the effect of high-powered incentives on relationship quality and specific investments, the key mediators driving distributor role performance. In addition, exporter oversight of distributor activities weakens the effectiveness of LPIs to increase distributor-specific investment. The authors derive implications for designing portfolios of incentives, with inferences based on efficiently matching incentive-induced motivational context with foreign distributor's actions required to accomplish exporter goals.","['export marketing (or, export/import marketing)', 'inter-organizational relationships', 'channel governance', 'incentives', 'psychic distance', 'importer role performance', 'BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS', 'SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS', 'RELATIONSHIP QUALITY', 'CHANNEL INCENTIVES', 'HIDDEN COSTS', 'TRUST', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'COMMITMENT', 'GOVERNANCE', 'OUTCOMES']","['incentives', 'relationship quality']","['relationship quality', 'relationship specific investments']",0.5,0.5

The results also suggest that network distance affects the reach and quality of mediated information: indirect ties to partners' partners, with their broad reach, facilitate the identification of investment opportunities, whereas direct ties, which have certification effects, facilitate quality assessment.

"This paper focuses on managers' marketing decision making during performance decline. Drawing on the reconciliation of theories of failure-induced change and threat-rigidity by Ocasio (1995), we examine how performance decline may result in a rigid decision-making process and decision characteristics that reflect the narrowing of attention and increased risk seeking. Furthermore, drawing on managerial compensation research, we consider how incentive pay may affect the marketing decision-making process and decision characteristics of managers during performance decline. Using a simulation game with experienced Chinese managers, our results indicate that performance decline decreases marketing strategy process comprehensiveness but increases reliance on short-term marketing decisions, strategic change, and strategic risk taking. Moreover, incentive pay attenuates the rigid decision-making process of managers but accentuates their heightened risk seeking during performance decline.

With regard to direct effects, our results show a negative impact of decision-making recursiveness and no significant relationship for openness and procedural rationality. Acknowledging the importance of the organization's micropolitical context in which these decision processes are embedded, we also test the moderating influence of politicality. Our findings provide support for our hypotheses that in a context of low politicality, the decision-making characteristics of openness and procedural rationality have a positive influence, whereas recursiveness negatively affects alliance performance. In a context of high politicality, however, openness and procedural rationality exert a negative influence, and the negative impact of recursiveness is aggravated. We suggest that alliance-related decision making cannot be adequately understood without explicitly considering the micropolitical context in organizations.","['nan', 'INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES', 'HIGH-VELOCITY ENVIRONMENTS', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'TRANSACTION COST', 'PROCEDURAL RATIONALITY', 'TECHNOLOGY ALLIANCES', 'COOPERATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'FIRM', 'DYNAMICS']","['strategic alliances', 'procedural rationality']","['strategic alliances', 'decision making']",0.5,0.5
"Research summary: This study employs longitudinal multilevel modeling to re-examine the relative importance of business unit, corporation, industry, and year effects on business unit performance. Total variance in performance is partitioned into stable variance and dynamic variance. Sources of these two parts of variance are explored. Empirical results indicate that (1) stable effects of corporation-industry interaction are substantially important, but were unequally confounded with stable effects of business unit, corporation, and industry in results of previous studies; (2) stable effects of corporation, industry, and corporation-industry interaction, taken together, are of similar relative magnitude to stable effects of business unit; and (3) random and nonlinear year effects are very important in explaining dynamic variance. These findings extend our theoretical and empirical understanding of performance variability.Managerial summary: Whether stable or changing, business units themselves, corporate-parents, and industries influence business unit operations. This article investigates the relative effects of these factors on business unit performance. Although the traditional wisdom is that business unit is critical, this research finds that corporate-parent, industry, and interactions between these, taken together, are as influential as business unit. Specifically, interactions between corporate-parent and industry are important for over-time average business unit performance, indicating that a given corporate-parent unevenly influences its business units in different industries and that a particular industry unevenly influences business units within itself from different corporate-parents. This study also demonstrates that changes in business unit, corporate-parent, and industry are important drivers of over-time volatility of business unit performance and that effects of these changes differ.

"One of the most important tasks in marketing is to create and communicate value to customers to drive their satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability. In this study, the authors assume that customer value is a dual concept. First, in order to be successful, firms (and the marketing function) have to create perceived value for customers. Toward that end, marketers have to measure customer perceived value and have to provide customer perceptions of value through marketing-mix elements. Second, customers in return give value through multiple forms of engagement (customer lifetime value, in the widest sense) for the organization. Therefore, marketers need to measure and manage this value of the customer(s) to the firm and have to incorporate this aspect into real-time marketing decisions.

The authors find that SCA consists of four components: negative self-evaluations, negative evaluations from customers, awareness of physiological symptoms (e.g., a queasy stomach, shaky voice, blushing), and protective actions (e.g., avoiding eye contact, fiddling with the hands. shunning self-disclosures). The authors show that these dimensions are functions of negative affectivity and anxiety-provoking contextual cues and that they negatively influenced the performance of 189 mortgage salespeople.","['nan', 'BOUNDARY ROLE AMBIGUITY', 'GOAL-DIRECTED EMOTIONS', 'NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY', 'SOCIAL PHOBIA', 'PERFORMANCE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'SELF', 'DETERMINANTS', 'ATTRIBUTION', 'ACCOUNT']","['negative affectivity', 'performance', 'self']","['sales call anxiety', 'disclosures']",0.0,0.0

"The primary objective of this study was to employ a value-attitude-behavior model in order to investigate the role personal values play in the patronage of regional shopping malls. A secondary objective was to examine whether one's ethnic group membership and ethnic identification serve as important factors that influence personal values as well as attitudes and patronage behavior in the context of regional shopping malls. The sample of regional mall shoppers consisted of white and Hispanic consumers residing in ten metropolitan cities of the southwest. Structural equation modeling indicated that both self-actualizing and social affiliation personal values were positively related to a favorable attitude toward regional shopping malls, and that the social affiliation value played a greater role in influencing attitude than did the self-actualizing value. Individual attitudes toward shopping malls, in turn, were a direct predictor of mall shopping behavior and mediated the relationship between personal values and attitudes. The findings indicate that, independent of ethnic group membership, both self-actualizing and social affiliation values can be used effectively to position regional malls in such a way as to reinforce these views and to provide a strong means for shoppers to satisfy these needs.","['nan', 'CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR', 'ETHNIC-IDENTITY', 'MODEL', 'DETERMINANTS', 'INTEGRATION', 'ATTRACTION', 'GOODNESS', 'AREAS', 'FIT']",['model'],[],0,0.0
"Drawing from signaling theory, this study investigates the processes through which corporate image (CI) for quality affects attitudinal loyalty. The research hypotheses are examined using data from a cross-sectional survey and two scenario-based experiments. Overall, findings across these three studies suggest that the effects of CI upon loyalty are channeled through customer satisfaction and perceived value. The effects of CI on perceived value and loyalty are stronger relative to the effects of employee interaction quality (IQ) when IQ is measured as an overall evaluation. However, when employee IQ is measured in reference to a specific service encounter, it becomes a stronger driver of perceived value and loyalty relative to CI. Regardless of the context of measurement (i.e., overall evaluation vs. a specific service encounter), employee IQ exerts a stronger influence on customer satisfaction than CI. CI negatively moderates the effect of employee IQ on customer satisfaction and loyalty, rendering the effect of employee IQ upon customer evaluations less critical for service providers with stronger CIs. The findings highlight the relevance and importance of CI as a signal of unobservable quality, which should be measured and closely monitored by management. Managers should also recognize the central role of customer satisfaction, especially in channeling the effects of IQ upon loyalty, and therefore, design policies that enhance frontline employee ability and motivation to deliver satisfying customer experiences.","['corporate image', 'employee interaction quality', 'signaling theory', 'attitudinal loyalty', 'common method bias', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'PRODUCT QUALITY', 'REPUTATION', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'MODEL', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'INFORMATION', 'JUDGMENTS', 'SHARE']","['corporate image', 'employee interaction quality', 'signaling theory', 'attitudinal loyalty', 'customer satisfaction']","['signaling theory', 'corporate image', 'customer satisfaction', 'perceived value', 'interaction quality iq']",0.6,0.6
"The notion of strategic groups has recently emerged as a critical perspective for uncovering firms' strategic postures/recipes and competitive market structures. Firms within strategic groups generally adopt similar strategic recipes and compete more intensely than firms across strategic groups. Building on recent research, the authors develop the concept of hybrid strategic groups, which blend the strategic recipes of more than one group, in contrast to existing conceptualizations of strategic groups, where either firms tightly follow the recipes of a strategic group (i.e., core firms) or firms loosely follow the recipes of a strategic group (i.e., secondary firms). Thus, competition among firms depends not only on the strategic group but also on the overlap of that strategic group with other strategic groups. The authors devise a combinatorial optimization based classification procedure utilizing a bilinear model that accommodates multiple variable batteries that can estimate hybrid strategic groups. The proposed methodology is illustrated by using archival data on public banks. For this illustration, the hybrid strategic group solution outperforms ordinary cluster analyses and offers critical insights into the nature of competition among firms.

"P>We re-conceptualize the Bartlett and Ghoshal typology of national subsidiary roles in the multinational enterprise (MNE), using a resource bundling perspective. Our view is that national subsidiary roles can vary dramatically across value chain activities. We focus on the distinction among innovation, production, sales, and administrative support activities. For each value chain activity, the subsidiary bundles sets of internal competences with accessible, external location advantages. We also address the effects of regional integration on national subsidiary roles. Such schemes may affect substantially the extent to which location advantages of individual countries can be accessed and bundled with internal competences, thereby typically altering some national subsidiaries' roles in specific value chain activities. However, such substantive changes in specific value chain activities performed by national subsidiaries do not necessarily lead to any move in conventional subsidiary role typologies, such as the Bartlett and Ghoshal one, since these typologies only acknowledge aggregate subsidiary role changes, supposedly valid for the entire value chain.","['nan', 'KNOWLEDGE FLOWS', 'CORPORATIONS', 'INTEGRATION', 'LOCATION', 'STRATEGY', 'MNE', 'SPECIFICITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETITION', 'INVESTMENT']","['integration', 'location', 'mne']","['innovation', 'integration']",0.5,0.3333333333333333
"This paper proposes a micro-level diffusion model to analyze individual physicians' adoption of a newly launched prescription drug. The adoption probability is a function of the following factors: physician-oriented marketing activities, patient requests for the new drug, social contagion among physicians, and physician characteristics. There are several major findings: (1) Consistent with previous literature, targeted detailing and journal advertising have a positive influence on individual physicians' adoption of the new drug. Furthermore, the positive effect of meetings and events sponsored by drug manufacturers is captured by this study, an effect that was omitted by previous studies. (2) Patient requests for the new drug are very influential on physicians' adoption of the new drug. This positive effect of patient requests is new to the extant literature on drug adoption. (3) With a sample representative of the U.S. market, this study demonstrates the existence of contagion effects on physicians' adoption of the new drug. This complements previous studies based on local markets that found contagion effects. (4) Some key physician characteristics, such as prescription volume in the category, are positively related to physicians' intrinsic propensity to adopt the new drug. In a validation exercise, the authors demonstrate that the proposed model performs well in identifying physicians who have a high likelihood of adopting a different new drug early, thereby facilitating targeting of marketing resources.","['nan', 'SOCIAL CONTAGION', 'INNOVATION']",['social contagion'],[],0,0.0
"In this article we present an ambidexterity perspective on the international expansion of emerging economy enterprises, highlighting the unique strategic behavior of emerging market multinational enterprises (EM MNEs). Specifically, we conceptualize ambidexterity as a multidimensional term comprising co-evolution, co-competence, co-opetition, and co-orientation. While all firms need and maintain some degree of ambidexterity, EM MNEs have stronger motives and abilities to build and leverage such ambidexterity to offset their late-mover disadvantages. They behave co-evolutionarily to deal with the external environment they face at home and abroad, levearge their co-competence (transactional and relational) to compete against their global rivals, develop co-opetitive (simulataneous cooperation and competition) ties with their business stakeholders, and maintain co-orientations (leveraging competitive advantages to bolster short-term survival and compensating competitive disadvantages for long-term growth). This article uses several cases from China to detail this view and provides theoretical and practical implications of ambidexterity in the context of global business. It sets a foundation for discussion and examination of the critical domain of multinational enterprises from emerging economies-one that is yet to be widely examined.","['nan', 'CAPABILITIES', 'COEVOLUTION', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'STRATEGY', 'FIRMS']",['firms'],"['co opetition', 'co orientation', 'firms']",0.3333333333333333,1.0
"One of the effects of the globalization process has been the diffusion of international management mindsets. Such a process of diffusion may be contributing to an increasing homogeneity of managerial practice around the world, but important differences still remain. The research reported in this article analyzes management as a process in the making, i.e., as a dynamic interplay between local culture, history and conditions, and the diffusion/adoption of international managerial techniques. The topic is approached inductively, through interviews with 71 managers based in Portugal. The article makes two main contributions: it analyzes management as a dialectical interplay between local factors and imported management knowledge, and helps to describe management practice in this Latin European country. Results suggest that the change process occurring in managerial practice in Portugal derives from the tension between a parochial mindset, inherited from almost five decades of dictatorship and its confrontation with a new international mindset. Some managers may be approaching this tension dialectically, through the enactment of a synthesis, which some informants interpret as potentially leading to a new Latin managerial touch.

"A retail franchisor needs growth capital so that the brand continues to grow and franchisor-franchisee relations remain strong. However, access to corporate liquidity to fund such franchise growth options is not unlimited. A method of raising finance particularly suited to retail franchisors is intellectual property (IP) securitization that allows companies to account for intangible assets such as intellectual property. royalty and brands and realize their full value. In recent years, a number of large restaurant franchisors have securitized their brands to raise hinds, including Dunkin Brands and Domino's Pizza (Domino's). We use property rights approach to show that IP securitization provides mechanisms that explicitly define ownership of intangible assets within the securitization structure and thus enables a company to raise funds against these assets. Using a case study example of a retail franchise IP securitization transaction, we also provide evidence that these mechanisms are not overly restrictive and can be used more widely to help fund retail franchise growth and expansion.

"Purpose - The popular beer game illustrates the bullwhip effect where a small perturbation in downstream demand can create wild swings in upstream product flows. The purpose of this paper is to present a methodical framework to measure the bullwhip effect and evaluate its impact. Design/methodology/approach - This paper illustrates a framework using SKU-level data from an industry-leading manufacturer, its distributors, end-users and suppliers. Findings - Firms benefit from tracking multiple intra-firm bullwhips and from tracking bullwhips pertinent to specific products, specific suppliers and specific customers. The framework presented in this paper enables managers to pinpoint bullwhip sources and mitigate bullwhip effects. Research limitations/implications - This paper presents a framework for methodically measuring and tracking intra-firm and inter-firm bullwhips. Practical implications - A disconnect exists between what is known and taught regarding the bullwhip effect and how it is actually tracked and managed in practice. This paper aims to reduce this gap. For the various products analyzed herein, the authors show how using this framework has the potential to reduce delivered product cost by 2 to 15 per cent. Social implications - Properly managing the bullwhip leads to lower inventories and potentially lower product prices while simultaneously increasing firm profits. Originality/value - This paper presents a novel approach to systematically tracking intra-firm bullwhips along with bullwhips specific to a given supplier or customer.","['Tracking', 'Supply-chain management', 'Bullwhip effect', 'PRODUCTION-SMOOTHING MODEL', 'SUPPLY CHAIN', 'INVENTORY BEHAVIOR', 'INFORMATION', 'SEASONALITY', 'VARIABILITY', 'VOLATILITY', 'DEMAND']","['tracking', 'bullwhip effect', 'demand']",[],0,0.0
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how Woolworths, a South African retail chain, evaluates and controls its sustainable business practices using economic, environmental and social indicators. Design/methodology/approach - A content analysis of Woolworths' comprehensive 2008-2011 sustainability and annual reports examined how this retail chain evaluates and implements its sustainable business practices. Findings - The results indicate that such indicators play a significant role in evaluating and implementing various Woolworths' business practices aimed at sustainability. In addition, Woolworths' comprehensive governance system ensures that its sustainable business practices are implemented and targets achieved. Research limitations/implications - The case study demonstrates that businesses can remain profitable, while at the same time protecting the natural environment and striving for sustainable business practices. Practical implications This example demonstrates how government influence, institutional mechanisms and senior management commitment to a project ultimately has gone some way to minimise barriers to the adoption of sustainable practices. Originality/value - The example provides not only a seed of knowledge for others in retailing, but also guidance to both practice in general and theory in the field of sustainable business practices. It demonstrates how an organization has taken strategic action, extended this beyond the firm's boundaries and into the supply chain. The case study illustrates how one organization can act as the change agent in the network.","['Sustainability', 'Strategy', 'Retail industry', 'Performance indicators', 'Triple bottom line', 'Woolworths', 'South Africa', 'Sustainable development', 'Retailing', 'nan']","['sustainability', 'woolworths', 'south africa', 'retailing']","['south african', 'sustainable business practices', 'sustainability', 'sustainable business practices', 'sustainability']",0.2,0.25
"Governance scholarship has suggested that venture boards should be structured so as to stimulate internal conflict. However, structure is a weak predictor of board effectiveness. Moreover, conflict can be dysfunctional, especially when it is focused on relationships rather than tasks. We show that venture boards experience more relationship conflict when they make financing decisions that involve devaluation of the venture and that this effect is moderated by whether the CEO is a founder. Our findings should prompt venture governance scholars to reconsider the importance of board structure, the value of board conflict and the behavior of founder- versus non-founder CEOs.

"Many firms are now using referral marketing campaigns to harness the power of word of mouth and to increase referrals to acquire new customers. Prior research has identified a method of computing the value of referrals using only a customer's actual past referral behavior to compute customer referral value (CRV). In this article, the authors develop and test a new four-step approach to compute CRV. In addition, they determine the behavioral drivers of CRV and then identify the most effective methods of targeting the most promising customers on the basis of their customer lifetime value (CLV) and CRV scores. The authors illustrate and test this approach through four separate field experiments with firms from two industries: financial services and retailing. They find that to maximize profitability, it is critical to manage customers in terms of both their CLV and CRV scores and that understanding the behavioral drivers of CRV can help managers better target the most profitable customers with their referral marketing campaigns.","['customer referral value', 'field studies', 'Bayesian Tobit model', 'customer lifetime value', 'WORD-OF-MOUTH', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DETERMINANTS', 'STRATEGY', 'GROWTH', 'IMPACT']","['customer referral value', 'customer lifetime value', 'word of mouth']","['word of mouth', 'field experiments']",0.5,0.3333333333333333

"Research Summary In this study, we offer a novel approach, establishing how firm conduct and competitive interactions among firms jointly provide microfoundations of risk-return relations. Firms influence each other, and the way they reciprocate these influences to cause mutual adjustments is a core feature of industry dynamics. This core feature fundamentally influences risk-return relations. Based on our approach, we develop models that allow us to trace how, at the microlevel, firm conduct in conjunction with competitive interactions generate risk-return relations, and how these are associated with macrolevel measures of industry concentration. That translates into an approach that affords fine-grained predictions of risk-return relations based on the nature of competition in an industry-for example, Cournot or Bertrand-and observations of the industry's competitive intensity and concentration. Managerial Summary The risk-return trade-off is of critical importance for strategic management. Yet, the relation between industry conditions and the shape of risk-return relations is often unclear. We develop a framework that allows managers to understand how industry conditions generate risk-return relations, and how these can be inferred from macro-level measures of industry concentration. At the micro-level, we show that low variation in operational implementation of strategies may, under some conditions, be associated with high variation as well as high means in financial returns. Our primary insight is that the risk-return trade-off changes with competitive intensity: Starting from industries with two or three firms, we show that increasing competitive intensity - higher number of firms, higher entry and exit barriers - gives rise to a predictable sequence of risk-return relations that change over the life-cycle of industries. Overall, we contribute a framework that allows managers to infer the risk-return trade-off for the industry that their business units are located in.","['Bertrand', 'Bowman paradox', 'Cournot', 'firm conduct', 'industry competition', 'reflection effect', 'risk-return', 'RISK-RETURN PARADOX', 'PROSPECT-THEORY', 'INTERDEPENDENCY', 'EVOLUTION']","['bertrand', 'cournot', 'firm conduct', 'risk return']","['risk return', 'industry dynamics', 'industry concentration', 'competition']",0.25,0.25
"Research Summary: This study analyzes how the divestitures that are impelled by activist investors in their campaigns against public corporations affect shareholder value. Using hand-collected data on the activist campaigns that were launched against and the divestitures that were undertaken by Fortune 500 companies between 2007 and 2015, we find that activist-impelled divestitures are more positively associated with immediate and longer-term measures of shareholder value than comparable manager-led divestitures. These performance differences persist for nearly two years after the completion of these deals. Our results empirically test the idea that firms with agency problems unlock shareholder value when they divest, and support the notion that activist investors fulfill an important external governance function. Our work also opens new research opportunities and offers practical implications as well. Managerial Summary: This study investigates how divestitures that are undertaken at the behest of activist investors affect shareholder value. We find that divestitures that were undertaken under pressure from activist investors are associated with more positive shareholder returns than comparable divestitures that were undertaken voluntarily by managers. These performance differences persist for nearly two years after the completion of these deals, alleviating concerns about the purported short-termism of activist investors. Our findings suggest that activist investors may fulfill an important governance function by inducing managers to undertake strategies that they might not otherwise pursue, thereby unlocking shareholder value.","['activist investors', 'agency theory', 'corporate governance', 'corporate scope', 'divestitures', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'AGENCY THEORY', 'HEDGE FUNDS', 'CASH FLOW', 'MANAGEMENT', 'FIRM', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INCENTIVES']","['activist investors', 'divestitures', 'firm', 'performance']","['divestitures', 'activist investors', 'performance', 'agency problems']",0.75,0.75
"We examine whether the presence of International Investment Agreements (IIAs), negotiated among countries for foreign investor protection, lowers political risk faced by multinational enterprises (MNEs). Drawing on research from international business, political science, and international law, we argue that IIAs increase expected future cash flows, and hence the value of foreign assets, by limiting the ability of host governments to make discriminatory policy changes. However, the need for IIA protection, and the ability to benefit from it, varies with firm characteristics. Using detailed transaction-level data for sale of petroleum assets in 45 countries, we find that MNEs pay significantly higher amounts for those protected by IIAs than similar but unprotected assets, an effect moderated by the firm's reserve size and state ownership.","['global institutions', 'political risk', 'international investment agreements', 'foreign direct investment', 'petroleum', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'LOCATION CHOICE', 'POLITICAL RISK', 'TREATIES', 'DETERMINANTS', 'MARKET', 'BITS', 'OIL', 'DIFFUSION', 'IMPACT']","['political risk', 'international investment agreements', 'petroleum', 'political risk']","['international investment', 'state ownership']",0.0,0.0
"This research builds foundational theory in a new domain of marketing: animated visual brand elements. It focuses on agent animation, which conveys a sense that the brand element, such as a logo, moves of its own volition, as distinguished from object animation, which does not. Given limited marketplace utilization (pilot study), animated logos represent new opportunities for branding and promotion. However, the influence of agent animation on attitude toward the firm or brand is contingent on the fluent processing of the animation in the context it is used. As compared with object-animated or static logos, agent animation encourages more favorable attitudes toward dynamic firms but less favorable attitudes toward stable firms (Studies 1 and 2). Further, more favorable attitudes arise when the brand personality suggested by the animation is consistent with other brand cues, such as brand slogans (Study 3) or the logo graphic (Study 4). Finally, the effects are replicated with choice behavior using established brands (Study 5).","['Logos', 'Animation', 'Attention', 'Agency', 'Brand personality', 'Brand attitude', 'PERCEPTUAL FLUENCY', 'PROCESSING FLUENCY', 'SINGLE OBJECT', 'ATTENTION', 'FIT', 'PERSONALITY', 'MOTION', 'PERSUASION', 'EXTENSION', 'MOVEMENT']","['logos', 'animation', 'brand personality', 'personality', 'motion']","['brand personality', 'slogans']",0.5,0.2
"Our purpose is to understand more fully the role of managerial cognition in organizations. As such, we adopted an experimental approach in studying the use of expert processing in the categorization of organizational problems. We compared the problem categories of 38 chief executive officers (CEOs) in the machine tool industry (experts) with those of 30 MBA students (novices). The results of a problem sorting task indicated that experts tended to categorize the ill-structured problems significantly faster than novices. Experts also had greater variance in the number of categories used and they incorporated more problem information. Follow-up analyses revealed that the number of categories was negatively related to experts' age and positively related to the number of processes and services offered by their respective organizations. These findings are consistent with the contention that experts rely on well-developed, context-dependent heuristics in the early stages of their decision-making. It is argued that such heuristics allow organizational experts to make sense of strategic issues quickly, and respond in an efficient and effective manner.","['nan', 'STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING', 'PHYSICS PROBLEMS', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'MODELS', 'THINKING', 'ISSUES', 'TASK']","['issues', 'task']",[],0,0.0
"Many technological innovations introduce attributes that are novel or completely unknown to a large number of consumers. For example, recently introduced attributes such as GPS in cars or I-Link in computers are likely to have been novel to many consumers. Past research suggests that the addition of novel attributes is likely to improve product evaluation and sales, since consumers interpret these attributes as additional benefits provided by the manufacturer. However, this article demonstrates that the positive effect of novel attributes holds only in the case of low-complexity products. In the case of high-complexity products, the addition of novel attributes can actually reduce product evaluation because of negative learning-cost inferences about these attributes. Further, the positive and negative effects of novel attributes on product evaluation are accentuated by external search for information when the information discovered through search is ambiguous in nature. Finally, it is shown that the negative effect of novel attributes on the evaluation of high-complexity products can persist even after consumers are given explicit information about the benefits of novel attributes. A key marketing implication of these findings is that novel attributes may contribute to technophobia, or consumer resistance toward technological innovation.","['nan', 'MEANINGLESS DIFFERENTIATION', 'ATTITUDE POLARIZATION', 'SWITCHING COSTS', 'INFORMATION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'CHOICE', 'PERSUASION', 'HYPOTHESIS', 'DECISION', 'IMPACT']",['information'],['information'],1.0,1.0
"The substantial literature on dispositional antecedents of career success (e.g., extraversion and conscientiousness) implies that being low in career-facilitating traits may hamper people's careers. We develop a cognitive-affective personality system theory about the role of situational cues, personality, and mindsets regarding the plasticity of one's attributes in determining when this will occur and how the related dysfunctional dynamics may be mitigated. We draw on trait activation theory to describe how the interaction of situational cues, personality, and mindsets may trigger an array of cognitive-affective units within a cognitive-affective personality system that influence subjective and objective career outcomes. The contributions of this article are to offer the largely between-person careers literature a within-person account of when and why people experience subjective and objective career success as a function of their personalities, situational cues, prevailing mindsets, and career contexts. A theoretical account of how personality predicts subjective career outcomes more strongly than objective career outcomes is thereby provided. Our intent is to also extend trait activation theory by considering the cognitive and affective dynamics whereby personality traits and situational cues have their effects. The conditions under which mindsets are likely to shape career outcomes are outlined.

"When people experience threats to important aspects of their self-concept (e.g., power, intelligence, sociability), they often compensate by consuming products that symbolize success, mastery, or competence on the threatened self-domain (within-domain compensatory consumption). Our research examines whether such compensatory consumption is effective in repairing the self-concept. Across seven experiments, we show that whether compensatory consumption is effective depends on the extent to which the connection between the compensatory products and the threatened domains is made explicit. When the connections are made explicit (e.g., through product names and marketing slogans), self-repair is impeded, but when the connections are only implicit (product is inherently symbolic of self-threat domain), self-repair can be successful. We further show that these differential effects of product connection explicitness are mediated by rumination: explicit connections induce rumination about the self-threat, which undermines self-repair, whereas implicit connections cause no rumination, facilitating self-repair. Our research provides a reconciliation of conflicting findings on self-repair in previous research, and also shows that despite the differences in efficacy, consumers compensate regardless of whether product connections are implicit or explicit, which has implications for consumer well-being.","['self-concept', 'identity', 'compensatory consumption', 'materialism', 'self-threat', 'self-discrepancy', 'SOCIAL EXCLUSION', 'CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION', 'CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR', 'MATERIALISM', 'POWER', 'PEOPLE', 'ESTEEM', 'PERILS']","['self concept', 'compensatory consumption', 'self threat', 'power', 'people']","['self concept', 'consumption', 'explicitness', 'rumination']",0.25,0.2
"The present research demonstrates that consumers often feel inhibited from engaging in hedonic activities alone, especially when these activities are observable by others. When considering whether to engage in a hedonic and public activity such as going to a movie alone, individuals anticipate negative inferences from others about their social connectedness that reduce their interest in engaging in the activity. Notably, consumers seem to overestimate how much their enjoyment of these activities depends on whether they are accompanied by a companion. Cues that attenuate consumers' anticipation of negative inferences by making an activity seem more utilitarian or by reducing the anticipated number of observers systematically increases interest in engaging in unaccompanied public activities.","['social norms', 'inhibition', 'hedonic consumption', 'affective forecasting', 'CONSUMPTION', 'PURCHASE', 'BELONG', 'OTHERS', 'NEED']",['others'],['inferences'],0.0,0.0

"Organizations are dynamic, hierarchically structured entities. Such dynamism is reflected in the emergence of significant events at every organizational level. Despite this fact, there has been relatively little discussion about how events become meaningful and come to impact organizations across space and time. We address this gap by developing event system theory, which suggests that events become salient when they are novel, disruptive, and critical (reflecting an event's strength). Importantly, events can originate at any hierarchical level and their effects can remain within that level or travel up or down throughout the organization, changing or creating new behaviors, features, and events. This impact can extend over time as events vary in duration and timing or as event strength evolves.

In this study, we unpack employee responses to organizational-level mechanisms of executive leadership style, organizational culture, and employment approaches by examining the mediating role of employees' perceptions of social and economic exchange relationships.

"Purpose - Music can be copied and distributed almost without cost via the internet, while payment and distribution technologies are reducing the transaction costs of its commercial exchange. In the case of MP3 the cost of swapping music files is negligible, for both the supplier uploading the file and the receiver who is downloading the music. In light of these developments, this paper seeks to put forward the proposition that the main barrier to entry in the music sector has been the ownership and protection of artistic content in the supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - The paper focuses on a review of the concepts relating to barriers to entry, since entry into the music industry is central to the explanation of the incumbents' strategic responses. The pre- and post-web supply chains are also assessed from a barrier to entry perspective. Findings - This paper argues that the internet is destabilising the supply chain for music by challenging the pre-web role and domination of the music industry supply chain; and by changing the primary entry barrier in the sector from the incumbents exploiting their ownership of copyright to one of trying to protect it.

"Can exposure to body shapes affect spending preferences? Because Western society associates thinness with economic value, we argue that a shape resembling thin human body types activates concepts related to positive financial outcomes, such as responsibility and hard work. The results of five experiments show that exposure to thin, human-like shapes influences consumer self-efficacy judgments and spending outcomes, depending on the perceiver's weight. In line with social comparison, we demonstrate that seeing a thin (vs. wide) human-like shape leads consumers with a high body mass index to make more indulgent decisions. Financial self-efficacy is highlighted as the underlying mechanism, and high resemblance to the human form is identified as a critical moderator.

"MNCs have been conceptualized as differentiated networks that, in turn, are embedded in external networks. Previous research has predominantly focused on the embeddedness of established subsidiaries into their local environment, omitting to shed light on the phenomenon of headquarters linkages to the local context which creates embeddedness overlap. We develop a model of why MNCs develop overlapping linkages to local subsidiary networks even if the subsidiaries have grown out of the initial start-up phase. Using detailed information on 168 European subsidiaries, we find that MNCs build and maintain more overlapping network ties when subsidiaries are high performers, hold important resources, operate in turbulent environments, and are closely connected to multinational actors as opposed to purely domestic firms.

"In the past three decades or so, globalization/regionalization, migration and reverse migration (also referred to as brain circulation), the ascendancy of emerging markets, the demand for people with a global mindset, and the worldwide war for talent have brought about fundamental changes to the nature, magnitude, and raison d'etre for human resource management (HRM) in a global context. These changes require us to adopt new lenses to fully understand the dynamics that impact international human resource management (IHRM) policies and practices. This paper presents new perspectives on IHRM as they relate to research on multicultural teams under the three dimensions of diversity (separation, variety, and disparity) posited by Harrison and Klein (2007), and brain circulation in the context of movement of peoples across countries. These perspectives go toward the traditional approach of studying expatriates, whether company-sponsored or self-initiated assignments.

Using this research as a point of departure, we propose that CCFG may impact family firm economic and noneconomic performance. Furthermore, we introduce to the family firm literature the organizational psychological capital (OPC), consisting of hope, efficacy, resilience, and optimism.

"Analysis of the rightmost digits of selling prices in a sample of retail price advertisements confirmed past findings indicating the overrepresentation of the digits 0, 5, and 9. The high cognitive accessibility of round numbers can account for the overrepresentation of 0- and 5-ending prices and suggests the existence of two effects that could account for the overrepresentation of 9-ending prices: (1) a tendency of consumers to perceive a 9-ending price as a round-number price with a small amount given back and (2) a tendency of consumers to underestimate a 9-ending price by encoding it as the first round number evoked during incomplete left-to-right processing. Analysis of the patterns of rightmost digits observed in the sample provides supportive evidence particularly for the second of these two 9-ending effects.","['nan', 'ACCESSIBILITY', 'FREQUENCY', 'NUMBERS', 'VALUES', 'RECALL', 'TIME']","['accessibility', 'numbers']","['round numbers', '9 ending effects']",0.0,0.0
"Software agents will play a crucial role in the coming digital economy, but their reliability and honesty cannot be guaranteed by technical security mechanisms, such as encryption of messages and digital signing of documents, and entities that can sanction fraudulent behavior in open networks are still in a rudimentary stage. This article describes a reputation mechanism that records previous cooperation behavior of participants in agent-based markets and conveys this information to other software agents, thereby influencing the future behavior of participants. The mechanism has been prototypically implemented in the Avalanche multiagent system.

"Social media are becoming ubiquitous and need to be managed like all other forms of media that organizations employ to meet their goals. However, social media are fundamentally different from any traditional or other online media because of their social network structure and egalitarian nature. These differences require a distinct measurement approach as a prerequisite for proper analysis and subsequent management. To develop the right social media metrics and subsequently construct appropriate dashboards, we provide a tool kit consisting of three novel components. First, we theoretically derive and propose a holistic framework that covers the major elements of social media, drawing on theories from marketing, psychology, and sociology. We continue to support and detail these elements - namely 'motives,' 'content,' 'network structure,' and 'social roles & interactions' - with recent research studies. Second, based on our theoretical framework, the literature review, and practical experience, we suggest nine guidelines that may prove valuable for designing appropriate social media metrics and constructing a sensible social media dashboard. Third, based on the framework and the guidelines we derive managerial implications and suggest an agenda for future research. (C) 2013 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

"Although prior research is congested with constructs intended to capture consumers' dispositions toward globalization and global/local products, their effects appear to replicate with difficulty, and little is known about the underlying theoretical mechanisms. This investigation revisits the relationship between prominent consumer dispositions (consumer ethnocentrism, cosmopolitanism, global/local identity, globalization attitude) and perceived brand globalness as determinants of consumer responses to global brands. Drawing on selective perception and social identity theories, the authors consider several theory-based model specifications that reflect alternative mechanisms through which key consumer dispositions relate to brand globalness and affect important brand-related outcomes. By employing a flexible model that simultaneously accounts for moderating, mediating, conditional, and direct effects, we empirically test these rival model specifications. A meta-analysis of 264 effect sizes obtained from 13 studies with 23 unique data sets and a total sample of 1,410 consumers raises concerns regarding the (potentially overstated) utility of consumer dispositions for explaining consumer responses to global brands. It also reveals a need for further conceptual contemplation of their function in international consumer research and managerial practice.","['consumer ethnocentrism', 'cosmopolitanism', 'global', 'local identity', 'perceived brand globalness', 'LOCAL BRANDS', 'IMPLICIT MEASURES', 'SOCIAL COGNITION', 'EXTENDED MODEL', 'HOME COUNTRY', 'METHOD BIAS', 'ATTITUDES', 'IDENTITY', 'ETHNOCENTRISM', 'COSMOPOLITANISM']","['consumer ethnocentrism', 'cosmopolitanism', 'global', 'local identity', 'perceived brand globalness', 'identity', 'ethnocentrism', 'cosmopolitanism']","['globalization', 'consumer ethnocentrism cosmopolitanism', 'brand globalness', 'global brands', 'meta analysis']",0.0,0.0

"Product innovation is an important research topic that has stimulated significant interest among management scholars and practitioners. Leadership has been suggested to be a critical factor affecting product innovation. Numerous studies have documented that transformational leadership positively influences product innovation performance, which is conceptualized as the degree to which a new product and/or service has achieved its market share, sales, rates of asset return, rates of investment return, and profit objectives. However, there is a lack of studies examining the specific means through which transformational leadership influences product innovation performance at the firm level. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the processes through which such effect is achieved and to determine whether corporate entrepreneurship and technology orientation as intervening factors influence this effect. To test the hypotheses, data were collected from 151 matched top management team (TMT) members and chief executive officers (CEOs) from Chinese manufacturing firms. Two separate questionnaires were used to collect the data. TMT members' questionnaire included measures of CEO's transformational leadership, whereas CEOs' questionnaire included questions about corporate entrepreneurship, technology orientation, and product innovation performance. Hierarchical linear regression was used to test the hypothesized effects. The results of the analysis provided the support for the fully mediating role of corporate entrepreneurship on the relationship between CEOs' transformational leadership and product innovation performance. In addition, technology orientation was found to significantly moderate the CEOs' transformational leadership-corporate entrepreneurship linkage. Furthermore, the mediated moderation effect of corporate entrepreneurship on the relationships among CEOs' transformational leadership, technology orientation, and product innovation performance was significantly supported. By studying leadership among CEOs, this study contributes to the research by elucidating the mechanisms through which transformational leadership influences product innovation performance. The mediating role of corporate entrepreneurship encourages managers to improve their leadership style so as to enhance the development of corporate entrepreneurship and innovation practices. The findings also show that technology orientation provides the conditions for the smooth translation of the CEO's transformational leadership into actual entrepreneurial activities. Hence, firms should prioritize technology orientation to optimize the implementation of transformational leadership so as to emphasize innovation and new venture creation.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'FIRM', 'CAPABILITIES', 'EMPOWERMENT', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'OWNERSHIP']","['mediating role', 'firm']",[],0,0.0
"While theory and evidence show that firms' competitive actions mediate the resource-performance relationship, details of top managements' roles in shaping resource utilization choices have been underemphasized. We address this oversight by integrating top management team heterogeneity and any resulting faultline strength with the resource-action-performance model to investigate how TMT composition differentially affects the model's two linkages. Specifically, we argue that TMT heterogeneity positively affects the resource-action linkage, yet negatively affects the action-performance linkage. Moreover, when heterogeneity begets strong faultlines, all such positive effect is lost.

"This study investigates how executives address information asymmetry and adverse selection surrounding international joint ventures (IJVs) and acquisitions. We argue that executives can address such exchange hazards not only through their governance decisions, as prior research indicates, but also through their selection of exchange partners. Our experimental design complements prior research on firms' governance choices in three ways: (1) by incorporating multiple potential exchange partners rather than taking a single partner as given for a realized transaction; (2) by accommodating multiple potential entry modes to address interdependencies across governance structures; and (3) by providing direct evidence on executives' assessments of IJVs and acquisitions.

"Bayesian estimation and inference remain infrequently used in organizational science research. Despite innumerable warnings regarding the entrenched frequentist paradigm, our field has yet to embrace the Bayesian revolution that seems to be sweeping through so many other disciplines. With this context as a backdrop, we address a simple yet difficult question: What is the likelihood that Bayesian methodologies eventually will supplement or even supplant traditional frequentist methodologies in the organizational science community? We draw on institutional theory to address this question, highlighting the cultural-cognitive, normative, and regulative forces that play important roles. As novel contributions to the discussion, we go beyond our own ideas and previously published opinions on the subject to report the opinions of 26 institutional elites (current and former officers of academic associations, editors, and editorial board members). These leading scholars help us shed light not only on the likelihood that Bayesianism will take root in the field but also on practical steps that could be taken to assist in this process. In some ways, we build Bayesian priors about Bayesian analysis, where those priors will be qualified on the basis of future events and outcomes.","['Bayes', 'frequentist', 'null hypothesis significance testing', 'institutional theory', 'institutional elites', 'CHAIN MONTE-CARLO', 'STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE', 'SIGNIFICANCE TESTS', 'PSYCHOLOGY', 'SOCIALIZATION', 'OBJECTIONS', 'EXEMPLARS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'REFORM', 'TRIAL']","['bayes', 'frequentist', 'institutional theory', 'institutional elites']","['bayesian estimation', 'inference', 'institutional theory', 'elites', 'bayesianism', 'bayesian analysis']",0.16666666666666666,0.25

"Corporations are increasingly influential within societies worldwide, while the relative capacity of national governments to meet large social needs has waned. Consequentially, firms face social pressures to adopt responsibilities that have traditionally fallen to governments, aid agencies, and other types of organizations. There are questions, though, about whether this is beneficial for society. We study this in the context of disaster relief and recovery, in which companies account for a growing share of aid, as compared to traditional providers. Drawing on the dynamic capabilities literature, we argue that firms are more able than other types of organizations to sense areas of need following a disaster, seize response opportunities, and reconfigure resources for fast, effective relief efforts. As such, we predict that, while traditional aid providers remain important for disaster recovery, relief will arrive faster and nations will recover more fully when locally active firms account for a larger share of disaster aid. We test our predictions with a proprietary data set comprising information on every natural disaster and reported aid donation worldwide from 2003 to 2013. Using a novel, quasi-experimental technique known as the synthetic control method, our analysis shows that nations benefit greatly from corporate involvement when disaster strikes.","['nan', 'SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'PRIVATE INVESTMENT', 'POLITICAL-ECONOMY', 'COLLECTIVE ACTION', 'GROWTH', 'FIRM', 'HUMANITARIAN', 'GOVERNANCE', 'CHALLENGES']","['dynamic capabilities', 'firm']","['dynamic capabilities', 'control method']",0.5,0.5

"Long-term customer relationships develop over repeated interactions, underscoring the importance of frontline employees (FLEs) engaging in ethical behaviors. Therefore, organizations must understand how a strong ethical climate (EC) may affect attitudes and behaviors among FLEs. This study reviews frontline-related EC research and employs a meta-analytic approach to investigate the direct, indirect, and contingent effects of EC on FLE actions, attitudes, and outcomes. The authors reviewed 67 frontline-related studies comprising a sample of 21,118 respondents to assess meta-analytic associations and derive a model for structural testing. The findings from this study show that a strong EC drives customer-oriented behaviors, fosters desirable job attitudes, reduces felt stress, increases perceived performance, and decreases turnover intentions among FLEs. The strength of theses associations is often predicated on individual-level (FLE experience), study-level (response rate), and country-level (perceived corruption, individualism/collectivism) factors. This study offers theoretical and managerial contributions germane to multiple uncertainties in service literature about EC's implications on FLEs, including EC's ability to break through sources of tension-facing FLEs, the mediated nature of EC's impact on perceived performance through frontline actions, and the generalizability of the economic and human benefits of EC across service contexts and frontline roles that foster greater diffusion in practice.","['ethical climate', 'frontline actions', 'frontline attitudes', 'frontline outcomes', 'meta-analysis', 'SALESPERSON CUSTOMER ORIENTATION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'SERVICE-DOMINANT LOGIC', 'SALES PERFORMANCE', 'JOB-SATISFACTION', 'SERVANT LEADERSHIP', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'MORAL JUDGMENT', 'EMPLOYEE ATTITUDES']","['ethical climate', 'frontline actions']","['term customer relationships', 'frontline employees', 'ethical climate', 'felt stress', 'performance', 'turnover intentions', 'corruption individualism collectivism']",0.14285714285714285,0.5

We complement this line of research by theorizing and testing the impact of CEOs' social capital on EO. From an original, multisource survey data set of 122 Chinese technology firms, we find that a CEO's bonding social capital with organizational members from various functional units has an inverted U-shaped relationship with firm EO, while the CEO's bridging social capital with the firm's diverse set of external stakeholders has a positive association with EO. In addition, we find that the relationship between CEO bridging social capital and EO becomes stronger as the firm's environmental instability increases.","['entrepreneurial orientation', 'CEO social capital', 'environmental instability', 'STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'MANAGERIAL DISCRETION', 'HIGH-TECHNOLOGY', 'RISK-TAKING', 'CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'PRODUCT INTRODUCTION', 'KNOWLEDGE CREATION', 'INTERFIRM NETWORKS', 'ADVICE NETWORKS']","['entrepreneurial orientation', 'environmental instability']","['entrepreneurial orientation', 'social capital']",0.5,0.5

Cultural environments, we argue, emerge in a primarily unintended fashion as a consequence of routine, network interactions among organizations in four overlapping yet analytically distinct sectors: government, the mass media, educational institutions, and the business community. Differences in the structure of these national networks condition dynamic patterns of change in nations' cultural environments. In highly centric national networks, government will tend to dominate the production of cultural environments. In less centric networks, other institutional sectors play more commanding roles.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONS']",['organizations'],['organizations'],1.0,1.0
"Hybrid organizational forms such as franchise systems join two or more independent parties under a contract. The ability of each party to achieve its goals depend upon the relative bargaining power in the relationship established by the contract. Using transaction cost economics and Porter's (1980) characterization of sources of bargaining power, this paper argues that the franchisor can make investments in activities such as tapered integration and buyer selection to increase its bargaining power and decrease conflict and litigation in a franchise system. Specifically, tapered integration (owning some units while franchising others), selecting inexperienced franchisees, and employing a long training program are predicted to increase the franchisor's bargaining power and the franchisee's compliance with franchisor standards. An empirical analysis of litigation in restaurant franchise systems supports the theoretical hypotheses.

"Multichannel customer management is the design, deployment, coordination, and evaluation of channels through which firms and customers interact, with the goal of enhancing customer value through effective customer acquisition, retention, and development.

The authors also propose a framework that shows the linkages among these challenges and provides a means to conceptualize the field of multichannel customer management. A review of academic research reveals that this field has experienced significant research growth, but the growth has not been distributed evenly across the five major challenges.

"This article responds to criticism that structural inertia theory neglects the internal influences on organizational adaptation. It develops a model exploring the logic of key decision makers in purposely endorsing structural inertia during organizational change. This response is labeled deliberate inertia, which is part of a typology delineating structural inertia. The model depicts a type of deductive reasoning showing the way that the structural status quo is intentionally selected when undertaking change for reasons outside population ecology. In asserting that structural inertia theory generally overlooks stability that stems from subjective sense making, the model indicates how decision makers delineate a belief in inertia (Layer 1 of the model), and then defend (Layer 2) and legitimize (Layer 3) this choice. This endorsement is deliberate and underscores the influence of decision makers in adopting inertia. Consequently, the model highlights why structural inertia is chosen regardless of pressures for and expectations of more fundamental structural change. The article discusses the implications of how this choice affects eventual structural change.","['structural inertia', 'organizational change', 'organization design', 'interpretative processes', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'WINE INDUSTRY', 'FAILURE', 'MODEL', 'COGNITION', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'COMMITMENT', 'MOTIVATION']","['structural inertia', 'organizational change', 'organizational change', 'model']","['change', 'ecology']",0.0,0.0
"The innovations of creative individuals are regarded as vital for business functioning and survival. To this end, efforts have been made to design measures of creative personality in hopes of predicting creative performance. Current measures of creative personality all reside at the explicit level, yet theory and research both suggest that a large proportion of personality can also be conceptualized at the implicit level. We address this issue by presenting a theoretical basis for creative personality that operates on an implicit level. Using conditional reasoning methodology, we describe five cognitive biases that serve as justification mechanisms for creative personality. Next, we link implicit creative personality to creative abilities through a developmental process. We then test this model and our new measure of creative personality in five different studies.

In addition, the new alternative in the choice set becomes more attractive and captures most of the market share.

Does this mean we have all the answers when it comes to ensuring the necessary level of cooperation and interaction between R&D and marketing? Of course not. Abbie Griffin and John R. Hauser note that prior research on R&D-marketing integration is being reassessed in light of the movement toward flatter organizational structures and cross-functional teams. To facilitate that reassessment, and to help guide future research in this area, they review recent research on the methods employed for integrating R&D and marketing, and they propose several hypotheses regarding those methods. They present their review and hypotheses within the framework of a causal map they have developed for studying functional integration. The causal map links cooperation to NPD success along situational dimensions, structural and process dimensions, and outcome dimensions. The desired outcome in any NPD effort is the timely commercialization of a profitable product. The situational dimensions address the amount and types of integration needed in a project, which depend on such factors as the project phase and the level of project uncertainty. The structural and process dimensions focus on the actions taken to achieve functional integration. These include relocation and physical facilities design, personnel movement, informal social systems, organizational structures, incentives and rewards, and formal integrative management processes. The proposed hypotheses focus on the methods for achieving functional integration-that is, the structural and process dimensions of the causal map. At first glance, these hypotheses seem to state the obvious. For example, few would challenge the notion that quality function deployment eliminates barriers to functional integration and improves information sharing between functions. However, achieving those benefits requires the presence of other factors such as senior management involvement. Rather than examine these hypotheses separately, researchers should explore the relative merits of the methods for achieving functional integration. In other words, future research must consider both the situational and the structural and process dimensions of this framework.","['nan', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES', 'QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT', 'DEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS', 'SUCCESS', 'INTERFACE', 'TEAMS', 'FIRMS', 'COMMUNICATION', 'COOPERATION', 'STRATEGIES']","['quality function deployment', 'success', 'interface', 'teams', 'cooperation']",['product development'],0.0,0.0
"Given that the impact of retail shelf facings and price on a product's market share is of substantial interest to marketing managers in the retail supply chain, we examine whether these relationships may be interdependent with the firm's supply chain activities. We offer predictions regarding the interdependence of the marketing and supply chain variables using monthly in-store observations from 62 different retail stores from five different chains, taken over a 24-month period. The in-store observations included price and number of facings, which is combined with data obtained from the manufacturer on case pack quantity and market share data from the ACNielsen HomeScan consumer scanner panel. Results indicate that shelf facings impact the effects of price and case pack quantity on market share. In addition, we explore the strength of relationships across retailers employing everyday low price versus HiLo pricing strategies. Generally, our findings suggest that retailers and suppliers must work to integrate marketing activities and supply chain processes both within and across firms to most effectively serve the consumer at the retail shelf and increase market share.","['Retail shelf space', 'Case pack quantity', 'Retail market share', 'Supply chain management', 'CATEGORY MANAGEMENT', 'CONSUMER RESPONSE', 'SPACE', 'ASSORTMENT', 'IMPACT', 'POWER', 'ORIENTATION', 'SALES', 'LEVEL']","['case pack quantity', 'impact']",['market share'],0.0,0.0
"A recent and promising trend in international business and international management research has been to consider institutions not only as taken-for-granted constraints that need to be accommodated, but also the outcomes of agency; purposive action by individuals, firms, coalitions and other actors. We elaborate the development of research in this vein, and advocate a more nuanced view of the nexus between agency and institutions of different kinds and residing at various levels of analysis, and the associated co evolutionary processes. Recent developments from cognate fields - particularly, institutional entrepreneurship and institutional work - offer a theoretical foundation for further insights into the nexus of institutions, agency and co-evolution. We discuss the papers that appear in this special issue and how they further develop and expand our understanding of institutions, agency and co-evolution, and conclude with questions and directions for future research.

"We apply structural equation models to longitudinal data on profits of firms within industries to study the persistence of abnormal returns. We obtain a two-way variance decomposition for abnormal returns: at firm vs. industry levels, and at permanent vs. transitory components. This decomposition enables us to assess the relative importance of the fundamental components of abnormal returns discussed in the literature. The method is applied to a panel of 5,000 Spanish firms observed over the period 1995-2000. We conclude that: (a) there are significant and permanent differences between profit rates at both industry and firm levels; (b) variation of abnormal returns at firm level is greater than at industry level; and (c) firm and industry levels do not differ significantly regarding rates of convergence of abnormal returns.

"Results from four experiments indicate that people expect to enjoy an experience more when it will follow a worse experience. We find that consumers expect hedonic contrast effects even when they do not experience such effects. Whereas individuals remember the absence of contrast effects after a short delay (study 1), individuals reporting retrospective judgments after a long delay (study 2) recalled that they had experienced contrast effects. These biased memories about contrast effects are eliminated when individuals focus on enjoyment during the experience. The present experiments document the time course of erroneous beliefs about contrast effects, mechanisms underlying their resistance to change, and the impact of these expectations about contrast effects on consumer choice.","['nan', 'ATTITUDE ACCESSIBILITY', 'VARIETY-SEEKING', 'BEHAVIOR', 'OUTCOMES', 'BIAS', 'PAST', 'LESS', 'SET']",['bias'],['judgments'],0.0,0.0
"To explore if, when, and how intentionally corporate officers conceal negative organizational outcomes from shareholders, we used computer-assisted content analysis of over 1,000 president's letters contained in annual reports to shareholders. Results suggest that outside directors, large institutional investors, and accountants limit such concealment, but small institutional investors and outside directors who are shareholders prompt it. Low disclosure is associated with subsequent selling of stock by top officers and outside directors. This result supports the claim that concealment by officers and its toleration by outside directors may be intentional.","['nan', 'CORPORATE-CONTROL', 'TOP-MANAGEMENT', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'MANAGERIAL CONTROL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'MARKET', 'ATTRIBUTIONS', 'DIRECTORS', 'DECISIONS']",['directors'],"['directors', 'institutional investors']",0.5,1.0
"Customer lifetime value (CLV), a metric used in many industries, is based on the cumulated cash flow a customer accrues during his or her lifetime. Firms have used CLV as a basis for formulating and implementing customer-specific strategies; however, these can vary across countries because of each country's cultural and economic influences. Typically, CLV is computed with three components: purchase frequency, contribution margin, and marketing costs. In this study, the authors demonstrate that national cultural dimensions affect the drivers of purchase frequency and contribution margin and that economic factors influence the components of CLV directly. They use customer-level transaction data from a global retailer for a random sample of customers in 30 representative countries over a six-year period. They estimate the model using a seemingly unrelated regression approach while accounting for the heterogeneity of customers across countries and the endogeneity of marketing costs incurred by the firm. The results indicate that global retailers should pay attention to the dimensions of national culture and economic conditions because of their differential impact on CLV.","['customer lifetime value', 'purchase frequency', 'national culture', 'economic growth', 'contribution margin', 'BEHAVIOR', 'COMMUNICATION', 'PROFITABILITY', 'STRATEGIES', 'CHOICE', 'SELF', 'CLV']","['customer lifetime value', 'purchase frequency', 'national culture', 'contribution margin', 'strategies', 'clv']","['customer lifetime value', 'national cultural dimensions']",0.5,0.16666666666666666
"Using the before-after natural experiment occasioned by the Arab Spring in Libya, we explore how market and non-market activity affect foreign firm legitimacy in times of political turmoil. Although all MNEs in Libya had to cultivate strong ties to Qadhafi to succeed during his 40 years of rule, we found that those that also invested in social-benefit projects and in social ties with families with few ties to the Qadhafi family earned a broad-based legitimacy that helped them survive Qadhafi's overthrow. Our findings contribute to the political risk and political behavior literature the notion that the pursuit of firm legitimacy in general, and especially in the eyes of social-sector actors, is an effective hedge against political risk. More theoretically, our findings support the addition of a social-sector-based path to firm legitimacy in the host country that complements and may at times substitute for, the government-based path to foreign firm legitimacy. Practically, our findings suggest that MNEs' facing severe political risk can improve their prospects for survival by investing in relationships with influential social groups and by offering goods or services that are perceived as socially valuable.","['political risk', 'non-market strategy', 'institutional theory', 'legitimacy', 'political ties', 'natural experiment', 'CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS', 'ENTRY STRATEGIES', 'JAPANESE FIRMS', 'INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT', 'SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT', 'MANAGING LEGITIMACY', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'VIOLENT CONFLICT', 'UNITED-STATES']","['political risk', 'legitimacy', 'natural experiment']","['libya', 'legitimacy', 'political risk', 'political behavior']",0.5,0.6666666666666666
"This study explored the relationships between the environmental scanning activities of chief executives from a single industry and their organizations' strategies, on the premise that executives employing different types of Porter's generic business-level strategies would use different scanning activities. There were differences in the strategy-scanning linkages. Specifically there are indications that firms with a differentiation strategy tend to employ a scanning activity that places more importance on evaluating opportunities and customer attitudes. Firms with a cost leadership strategy tend to use a scanning activity that evaluates competitive threats and tracks the policies and tactics of competitors.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS', 'BUSINESS STRATEGIES', 'CONTINGENCY VIEW', 'PERFORMANCE', 'IMPACT', 'EXECUTIVES', 'TYPOLOGY', 'MANAGERS', 'STATE', 'ART']",['executives'],[],0,0.0
"In the resource-based view of strategy and in evolutionary economics, complementary assets play a crucial role in explaining sustainable competitive advantages and innovations. Despite the apparent importance of complementary assets for the understanding of corporate strategy, their creation and the associated managerial problems have been much less discussed. We believe this to be a major weakness in the strategic theory of the firm. Interestingly, problems of coordination and cooperation are center stage in the contract-based theories of the firm, and we try to integrate some of their insights into a resource-based perspective. Specifically, we show how complementary assets raise the need for strategic direction by a firm's top management. Moreover, complementary assets magnify internal incentive problems, and their management has an impact on the innovativeness of a firm. Lastly, complementary assets play a crucial role in the internal appropriation of innovative rents. We demonstrate the fruitfulness of our integrated framework by relating some of our findings to the literature on corporate strategy, industry evolution, and organizational structures.

"Firms increasingly employ global and local consumer culture positioning strategies (GCCP/LCCP), but understanding of the drivers that underlie consumer responses to such strategies is limited, leaving firms with little guidance on when to choose one strategy over another. To shed light on consumer preference for GCCP versus LCCP, the authors examine the effects of regulatory focus (promotion and prevention orientation) and global consumption orientation (GCO) on preference for GCCP/LCCP. They report the results of three studies: the first is based on a survey with samples drawn from the United States and China, and the second and third are behavioral designs manipulating situational promotion and prevention regulatory focus. The findings suggest that promotion focus is positively related to GCO and prevention focus is negatively related to GCO. Furthermore, the authors find that GCO is positively related to a preference for GCCP. Thus, this research offers a unique perspective by introducing regulatory focus to the GCCP literature, identifying GCO as an important mediator, and demonstrating that regulatory focus can be situationally activated.","['global consumption orientation', 'global consumer culture positioning', 'regulatory focus', 'cross-cultural invariance', 'PERCEIVED BRAND GLOBALNESS', 'PROMOTION', 'ATTITUDES', 'PREVENTION', 'WILL', 'FIT', 'GLOBALIZATION', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'PERSONALITY', 'MOTIVATION']","['global consumption orientation', 'regulatory focus', 'promotion', 'prevention']","['local consumer culture positioning strategies', 'regulatory focus promotion', 'prevention', 'global consumption orientation']",0.5,0.5

Using data collected from customers of a global financial services firm, this study modeled the multifaceted impact of customer education initiatives on the relationship between service quality, and trust.

"Research Summary Using 138 firm-year observations for 46 U.S.-listed firms headquartered in tax havens from 2004 to 2013, this study employs a matched-sample design and documents that the level of corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement is relatively lower for firms with tax haven headquarters (HQ) than for those with U.S. HQ. This result is robust to the use of firm philanthropy as a measure of CSR engagement and holds true in an environment with high CSR expectations from U.S. communities. In an alternative setting of HQ relocations within the United States, we use a difference-in-differences methodology and find that when firms move their HQ to states with lower corporate income taxes, they decrease the level of CSR engagement. Overall findings are consistent with corporate culture theory. Managerial Summary This article examines CSR engagement of U.S.-listed firms headquartered in tax havens. Using data from 2004 to 2013, we find that firms with tax haven HQ exhibit a relatively lower level of CSR engagement than otherwise similar firms headquartered in the United States. In the same vein, tax-haven-headquartered firms tend to give less to charity, even when they face high CSR expectations from U.S. communities. In an alternative setting of HQ relocations within the United States, we document that the level of corporate social engagement is more likely to drop for firms that move their HQ to lower-tax regions. We interpret our findings as evidence of corporate culture affecting both the tax avoidance and CSR activities of firms headquartered in tax havens.","['corporate culture', 'corporate philanthropy', 'corporate social responsibility', 'offshore corporate headquarters', 'tax haven', 'ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURES', 'AVOIDANCE EVIDENCE', 'AGGRESSIVENESS', 'RISK', 'PHILANTHROPY', 'DECISIONS', 'COMPANIES', 'ANALYSTS', 'IMPROVE', 'LOGIT']","['corporate culture', 'corporate social responsibility', 'tax haven', 'philanthropy']","['tax havens', 'corporate social responsibility csr engagement', 'tax haven headquarters', 'firm philanthropy', 'hq relocations', 'corporate culture theory']",0.0,0.0
"Resource slack represents a double-edged sword, simultaneously fueling and hindering growth. Drawing on Penrose's growth theory and Stevenson's entrepreneurial management theory, we have developed and tested a conceptual model that provides a more nuanced account of the resource slack-growth relationship. Using a large dataset spanning six years, we have found that slack has a positive direct effect on growth but a negative effect on entrepreneurial management, and that entrepreneurial management has a positive effect on growth. Our empirical and conceptual findings are important to the development of firm growth theory and explicate causal mechanisms transforming slack into firm-level outcomes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Language LISC is key, but needs to be combined with an ability to devise a setting in which to perform the language. The paper shows how middle managers knowledgeably enact these two sets of discursive activities by drawing on contextually relevant verbal, symbolic, and sociocultural systems, to allow them to draw people from different organizational levels into the change as they go about their day-to-day work.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATION', 'POWER', 'CHALLENGES', 'DISCOURSE', 'POLITICS', 'ISSUES']",['organization'],"['managers', 'change', 'sensemaking language']",0.0,0.0
"Although research suggests knowledge spillovers often benefit imitators at the expense of originators, we investigate how originating firms may also benefit from their own spillovers.

In a longitudinal study of 87 telecommunications manufacturers, we found that a firm's rate of innovation and the extent to which these innovations integrate knowledge from the spillover knowledge pool is greater when this pool is larger in size and similar to the firm's knowledge base.","['nan', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'PATENT CITATIONS', 'INNOVATION', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'EXPLORATION', 'INDICATORS', 'COMPLEX', 'SYSTEM', 'FLOWS']",['innovation'],"['knowledge spillovers', 'innovation']",0.5,1.0

"This research presents an empirical study of the impact of a retail frequency reward program on store sales. We examine both the points pressure, or short-term impact, and the rewarded behavior, or long-term impact. The points-pressure impact is due to forward-looking customers increasing their purchase levels in order to earn the reward. The rewarded-behavior impact is evidenced as purchases above baseline levels after an individual has received a reward and could result from either behavioral learning reinforcement or positive affect resulting from the reward. We investigate a turkey reward program that awarded free turkeys to shoppers who accumulated the required sales levels during an 8-week period. We find both a points-pressure and rewarded-behavior impact. These effects are statistically significant and managerially relevant in that the program is apparently profitable. The points-pressure impact is especially strong among customers who do not place value on frequent shopper programs that in general deliver immediate price discounts. The key implications are that frequency reward programs of the form, buy x, then receive xx can be profitable, are segmentation strategies, and can complement a store's overall frequent shopper program.

"Persistent high failure rates of new product alliances call for identification of factors that might improve alliance outcomes. In this research, the authors identify two attributes of alliance network asymmetry that affect alliance performance and performance uncertainty: differences in the number of prealliance direct ties, which can create asymmetry in the volume of resources of the two firms, and differences in the interconnectivity among prealliance indirect ties, which leads the firms to possess different types of resources. The authors theorize that absolute levels of such asymmetries have curvilinear effects on alliance performance and performance uncertainty, which materialize as a focal firm's abnormal returns and risk, respectively. They demonstrate that direct tie asymmetry has an inverted U-shaped effect on the focal firm's abnormal returns and a U-shaped effect on its risk. Indirect tie asymmetry also has a U-shaped effect on the focal firm's risk. However, the focal firm's innovation quality and preexisting ties with its partner flatten these curvilinear effects.

"The objectives of this study are to investigate whether foreign acquiring firms contribute towards enhancing technological capabilities of local firms in foreign markets. Given that drivers promoting technology acquisition from acquiring firms have been largely neglected in the literature, we attempt to identify the key factors influencing this phenomenon. Secondly, although several studies have discussed knowledge exchange through international acquisitions (IAs), little attention has been given to small and medium sized local acquired firms (SMLFs). By using three dimensions of organizational characteristics based on absorptive capacity, our empirical evidence reveals three key findings. First, to develop an effective absorptive capacity, mere exposure to favorable learning environments is not sufficient, and that intensity of effort is a critical component functioning as a facilitator towards the extent of learning. Second, what is already known can be improved when partners share similar business background. This is because the possession of relevant knowledge based on business relatedness increases the boundary of curriculum in organizations.

"Retail atmospherics is becoming an increasingly important strategic tool for stores and restaurants. Ambient music and background noise are especially important atmospheric elements given their ubiquity in retail settings. However, there is high variation in the volume of ambient music and background noise, with some stores/restaurants having very loud ambience and others having very quiet ambience. Given the variation in loudness levels at stores/restaurants, and the managerial ease of adjusting volume level, we investigate the consequences of ambient music (and background noise) volume on food choices and sales. A pilot study, two field experiments, and five lab studies show that low (vs. high or no) volume music/noise leads to increased sales of healthy foods due to induced relaxation. In contrast, high volume music/noise tends to enhance excitement levels, which in turn leads to unhealthy food choices.","['Retail atmospherics', 'Sensory marketing', 'Ambient music', 'Food sales', 'Healthy and unhealthy foods', 'IN-STORE MUSIC', 'EMOTIONAL RESPONSES', 'RELAXING MUSIC', 'TASTE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'STRESS', 'ANXIETY', 'AROUSAL', 'IMPACT', 'TEMPO']","['retail atmospherics', 'ambient music']","['retail atmospherics', 'ambient music', 'background noise', 'food choices']",0.5,1.0

"The hubris tradition of research has been criticized for limiting its scope by associating hubris predominantly with detrimental leadership behaviours. To counteract this bias, we provide a more nuanced exploration of hubris and consider both beneficial and detrimental manifestations of hubris in start-up founders' leadership behaviours. Our analysis, based on qualitative data from expert interviews and two case studies, indicates that, whilst hubristic start-up founders are likely to fail overall, they also excel in creating and communicating visionary scenarios, steering employees through critical situations, and extracting commitment from third parties. These under-researched 'bright' manifestations of hubris allow start-up founders to lead their venture towards a stage, in which their visionary power and resilience become crucial prerequisites for economic progress.

"Firms increasingly use cross-functional teams to develop new products, yet we know little about the processes that make teams excel. Although studies have focused on within-team processes like cooperation between and integration of individuals from various functional areas, some emerging literature suggests that the processes that make teams excel are richer and more complex than cooperation and integration. In order to capture the processes that lead to excellent market performance of new products, we introduce the concept of charged team behavior, the extent to which cross-functional product development teams are enthusiastically and jointly driven to develop superior new products. Charged team behavior captures not only the drive, commitment, and joy of team members, but also their collaborative behaviors to achieve an exceptional outcome. We propose and test a series of hypotheses concerning how charged behavior affects new product market performance and how charged behavior is, in turn, influenced by both team structural characteristics (physical proximity, team longevity, and outcome interdependence) and contextual factors (senior management encouragement to take risk, quality orientation, exposure to customer input. extent of competition, and interdepartmental connectedness). It is particularly important to examine the antecedents of charged behavior because there are concerns that some of the team-related factors generally considered to be useful for teams may not necessarily lead to charged teams. Data from new consumer product development teams is analyzed though structural equation modeling for hypothesis testing. We find evidence that highly charged teams are more likely to develop successful new products. Results also indicate that outcome interdependence, exposure to customer input, extent of competition, and interdepartmental connectedness are positively related to charged behavior. Physical proximity, team longevity, encouragement to take risk, and quality orientation do not improve teams' charged behavior. Data suggests that charged team behavior: 1) fully mediates the effects of outcome interdependence and interdepartmental connectedness on performance, 2) partially mediates the influence of exposure to customer input and the extent of competition on performance, and 3) does not mediate the effects of quality orientation and physical proximity on performance. Our study highlights the importance of creating highly charged product development teams in order to achieve exceptional performance. Further. our results indicate that some of the factors suggested by traditional social psychology research for enhancing team effectiveness (e.g., physical proximity and team longevity) may not necessarily create charged teams. Instead, charged teams need a special arrangement, in which members are accountable to the ream and where their evaluations and rewards are also linked to the performance of the team. In addition, although a strong emphasis on quality is considered to be beneficial for new products, as our results indicate, such emphasis cannot create a charged atmosphere. Moreover, our research suggests that if the organization structure does not permit frequent contact between individuals across functional boundaries, the creation of a strongly charged team and development of a successful new product will be hindered.

"Assessing the applicability of frameworks developed in one country to other countries is an important step in establishing the generalizability of consumer behavior theories. in order for such comparisons to be meaningful, however. the instruments used to measure the theoretical constructs of interest have to exhibit adequate cross-national equivalence. We review the various forms of measurement invariance that have been proposed in the literature, organize them into a coherent conceptual framework that ties different requirements of measure equivalence to the goals of the research, and propose a practical, sequential testing procedure for assessing measurement invariance in cross-national consumer research. The approach is based on multisample confirmatory factor analysis and clarifies under what conditions meaningful comparisons of construct conceptualizations, construct means, and relationships between constructs are possible. An empirical application dealing with the single-factor construct of consumer ethnocentrism in Belgium, Great Britain, and Greece is provided to illustrate the procedure.","['nan', 'COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS', 'STRUCTURE MODELS', 'VALIDATION', 'EQUIVALENCE', 'POPULATIONS', 'STRATEGIES', 'CETSCALE']",['equivalence'],"['research', 'confirmatory factor analysis', 'ethnocentrism']",0.0,0.0

"A source of potentially valuable knowledge in multinational enterprises is foreign marketing knowledge-that is, knowledge from one country unit that may offer value and competitive advantage to marketing managers in other country units. This article builds on marketing and management knowledge transfer research to further understand both the conditions under which one subsidiary uses external knowledge from another subsidiary and the outcomes of such use in the subsidiary's market. Using the theory of value creation and appropriation and field interviews with headquarter and subsidiary marketing managers, the authors develop a model and research propositions of the enabling, motivating, and perceiving conditions that affect foreign marketing knowledge use and subsequent effects on marketing program effectiveness and efficiency, organization identification, and intellectual capitol in subsidiaries of multinational enterprises.","['international marketing', 'marketing strategy', 'knowledge use', 'foreign subsidiaries', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'FIRMS', 'INNOVATION', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'ORIENTATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INTEGRATION']",['knowledge use'],"['marketing knowledge', 'knowledge transfer']",0.0,0.0
"Whereas current literature emphasizes the positive consequences of co-creation, this article sheds light on potential risks of co-created services. Specifically, we examine the implications of customer co-creation in service failure episodes. The results of four experimental studies show that in a failure case, services high on co-creation generate a greater negative disconfirmation with the expected service outcome than services low on co-creation. Moreover, we examine the effectiveness of different service recovery strategies to restore customer satisfaction after failed co-created services. According to our results, companies should follow a matching strategy by mirroring the level of customer participation in service recovery based on the level of co-creation during service delivery. In particular, flawed co-creation promotes internal failure attribution which in turn enhances perceived guilt. Our results suggest that in such case customer satisfaction is best restored by offering co-created service recovery.","['Customer co-creation', 'Service failure', 'Service recovery', 'Technology-based services', 'SELF-SERVICE', 'PRODUCT FAILURE', 'SATISFACTION', 'RECOVERY', 'PARTICIPATION', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'MODEL', 'CONSUMERS', 'TIME']","['customer co creation', 'service failure', 'service recovery', 'satisfaction', 'recovery', 'participation']","['co creation', 'co created services', 'customer co creation', 'service failure', 'disconfirmation', 'service recovery', 'customer satisfaction', 'customer participation', 'service', 'attribution', 'guilt']",0.2727272727272727,0.5
"Capitalism is the dominant economic system adopted throughout the global economy, but there are many different models of capitalism practiced depending on what the society decides economic effectiveness is. In this study, we assert that an effective economy simultaneously achieves two seemingly divergent outcomes: it (1) creates economic wealth efficiently, and (2) shares that wealth equitably. Employing insights from Whitley's national business systems framework and fuzzy set analysis, we examine how national institutions collectively configure with respect to the overall level of equitable wealth creation within 48 developed and developing economies. We find that three configurations are associated with relatively high levels of equitable wealth creation, and another three are associated with relatively low levels. As such, our analysis supports the notion of equifinality - that there is no one optimal model of capitalism. Furthermore, we begin to demonstrate that these models of capitalism are constantly evolving, but their evolution is generally slow even when considering the practice of capitalism before and after the 2008 global economic crisis. We discuss the implications of these findings for the study of international business, with a special emphasis on considering a more holistic context for exploring how multinational enterprises interact with their institutional environment(s).","['capitalism', 'comparative capitalism', 'fuzzy set methods', 'institutional theory', 'equitable wealth creation', 'macro-level analysis', 'PURCHASING POWER PARITY', 'INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEMENTARITY', 'COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'BUSINESS SYSTEMS', 'INEQUALITY', 'VARIETIES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONTEXT', 'DIVERSITY']","['capitalism', 'equitable wealth creation', 'business systems', 'context']","['capitalism', 'fuzzy set analysis', 'institutions', 'enterprises']",0.25,0.25
"As different types of knowledge may have different effects on new product positional advantage, knowledge portfolio management in concert with the firm's strategic orientation is indispensable for new product success. However, previous research has not dealt with the knowledge resources and strategic implementations that affect new product development (NPD). To fill in this gap, the current study focuses on two dimensions of knowledge type (knowledge complexity and knowledge tacitness) and two forms of strategic orientation (technological orientation and market orientation), which influence the positional advantages as determinants of NPD outcomes. Drawing on the resource-based view, this study explains how these knowledge and strategic orientation variables influence new product creativity, which comprised the novel and meaningful characteristics of new products. Finally, it demonstrates how these two dimensions of new product creativity differentially provide product advantages in terms of customer satisfaction and product differentiation, which lead to superior new product performance. A conceptual framework is developed and the related hypotheses provided to incorporate the study variables and to test their relationships in a sample based on data collected from both marketing and project managers from 100 U. S. high-technology firms. The model estimation results from path analysis demonstrate that reliance on knowledge of high tacitness harms meaningfulness, while reliance on knowledge of high complexity increases both novelty and meaningfulness of new product. As expected, market orientation and technological orientation improve the meaningfulness and novelty dimensions of the new product, respectively. New product novelty and meaningfulness are shown to enhance new product advantage in terms of product differentiation and customer satisfaction, both of which contribute to new product performance. It is also found that the combinative use of market orientation and knowledge complexity, and technological orientation and knowledge tacitness positively influence both the novelty and meaningfulness of new products. This study, using the product-level analysis, contributes to the literature by clarifying how the firm's different knowledge properties and strategic orientations both play a role as a source of new product creativity, and how new product creativity, as a valuable and rare resource, enhances new product advantage. The study results suggest that project/product managers should increase the transferability and codifiability of unstructured knowledge by stimulating intraorganizational knowledge sharing among NPD team members, and that they should promote both technology and market-orientated practices to fully develop creativity of new products.","['nan', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'CAPABILITIES', 'INNOVATION', 'DIMENSIONS', 'INCUMBENTS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'FRAMEWORK']","['resource based view', 'market orientation', 'customer satisfaction', 'dimensions', 'management', 'framework']","['resource', 'view']",0.0,0.0
"This study used computer-assisted content analysis of more than four. hundred presidents' letters to shareholders to examine empirical linkages between cognitive strategic groups clustered by thanes in the reports and strategic groups clustered by performance. We found these groups converged as predicted by the literature, and that mental models and performance are involved in a recursive process of competitive enactment which contributes to strategic group stability. Our research used inductively derived themes from the letters to structure a mental model widely shared in the pharmaceutical industry: and then employed thematic variations to find stable clusters of companies. These thematic clusters were triangulated with the strategic groups from a published study of the same industry, in the same period and were shown to converge. Additionally, longitudinal linkages between earlier mental models of strategic goals and later reports of performance were found.

"It is well known that individuals engage in reactive consumption to address self-discrepancy and self-threat and that this consumption may either be symbolically related to the nature of the threat or occur in an unrelated domain. This research proposes a theory for self-worth restoration through the consumption of high-intensity sensory stimuli. Four studies demonstrate that not only do individuals facing self-threat prefer high-intensity sensory consumption (HISC) but also that this consumption restores their self-worth. This propensity for HISC is negated after individuals are allowed to engage in additional self-affirmation tasks. The findings are documented in both the visual domain (as evidenced by a preference for more intense and saturated colors) and the auditory domain (as evidenced by a preference for louder audio levels). The consumption of high-intensity sensory stimuli elevates individuals' arousal levels, which in turn minimizes rumination on thoughts related to the threat and thus restores one's self-worth. The distractive nature of HISC and its subsequent impact on self-worth restoration is shown to operate regardless of the valence of the sensory consumption. Finally, the propensity for HISC is negated after individuals experience an arousal-elevating threat, providing additional support for the underlying process.","['high-intensity sensory consumption', 'compensatory consumption', 'distraction', 'arousal', 'self-threat', 'self-worth', 'WOMENS MATH PERFORMANCE', 'STEREOTYPE THREAT', 'COMPENSATORY CONSUMPTION', 'CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'GENDER IDENTIFICATION', 'COLLEGE-STUDENTS', 'AROUSAL', 'AFFIRMATION', 'ESTEEM']","['high intensity sensory consumption', 'arousal', 'self threat', 'self worth', 'arousal', 'affirmation']","['consumption', 'self threat', 'self worth restoration', 'sensory consumption', 'arousal']",0.4,0.3333333333333333
"Information technology (IT)-related service is the strategic management of the creation and delivery of service in which information and communication technology (referred to as IT here) plays a substantial role. IT can serve as a facilitator (e.g., facilitates access to customer information and customer communication) or enabler (e.g., enables value cocreation), serves as the context (e.g., mobile phone market or e-commerce), or is itself service (e.g., social networking sites or information goods). There are three essential characteristics of IT-related serviceit is information-intensive, customer-centric, and multidisciplinary. IT-related service is information-intensive. The ability to communicate (firm-to-customer, firm-to-firm, and customer-to-customer) anytime, anywhere, and to anyone, is significantly facilitated by the recent technology trends of big data, cloud computing, and mobile and networking platforms. IT-related service is customer-centric. The use of IT, both by firms and by customers, alleviates the common observation that there is a trade-off between customer satisfaction and productivity improvement for service. Customers are able to talk back to firms with their new communication power and firms are better able to cost-efficiently satisfy their customers. The study of IT-related service is thus inherently multidisciplinary involving such fields as marketing, strategic management, computer science/information systems, and operations management/organizational research. The results of the IT-service transformation are that IT blurs the distinction between goods and service; service is becoming more goods-like and goods are acquiring the characteristics of service. The Journal of Service Research special issue on IT-related service brings together all of these elements, and provides rich strategic implications for managers.","['service', 'service science', 'service transformation', 'big data', 'customer analytics', 'environmental scanning', 'customer-centric', 'information systems', 'information technology', 'service marketing', 'service operations', 'nan']","['service', 'service transformation', 'big data', 'customer centric', 'information systems', 'information technology']","['information', 'satisfaction']",0.0,0.0
"Purpose - This research intends to investigate whether there are synergies that a firm could or should exploit by simultaneously implementing customer and supplier integration. In particular, the aim is to analyze the impact of customer integration on efficiency, and the moderating role of supplier integration. Design/methodology/approach - This study analyzes data from a sample of 200 manufacturing plants. Two hypotheses are tested through a hierarchical regression analysis. Customer and supplier integration constructs consider items related to different aspects of the integration (e.g. sharing of production plans and customers' forecasts, feedback on performance, communication on quality considerations and design changes, joint quality improvement efforts, close contact, partnerships). The focus of the integration clearly extends beyond the dyad, as it includes the integration of focal operations upstream and downstream, with both suppliers and customers. Findings - Supplier integration positively moderates the relationship between customer integration and efficiency, whereas the analyses do not support the hypothesis that in general customer integration positively impacts on efficiency. They also reveal that, when supplier integration is at a low level, customer integration can even produce a reduction in efficiency. Practical implications Efficiency performance optimization requires levering simultaneously on customer and supplier integration to foster their interaction, rather than investing and acting on customer integration only. In addition, before deciding whether to invest in customer integration, managers should ascertain the level of supplier integration, since it acts as a prerequisite for the successful implementation of customer integration. Originality/value - Compared with previous studies investigating the main impact of customer and supplier integration on a company's performance, this research analyzes a model that considers the interaction effect between these integration strategies. This provides a number of original implications for the interpretation of the relationship between customer and supplier integration and efficiency.","['Supplier relations', 'Supply chain management', 'Performance measures', 'Customer relationship management', 'MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION', 'INFORMATION', 'IMPACT', 'STRATEGY', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'IMPROVEMENT', 'INVENTORY', 'BUSINESS', 'MODEL']","['impact', 'implementation', 'improvement', 'model']",['supplier integration'],0.0,0.0

"The context in which service is delivered and experienced has, in many respects, fundamentally changed. For instance, advances in technology, especially information technology, are leading to a proliferation of revolutionary services and changing how customers serve themselves before, during, and after purchase. To understand this changing landscape, the authors engaged in an international and interdisciplinary research effort to identify research priorities that have the potential to advance the service field and benefit customers, organizations, and society. The priority-setting process was informed by roundtable discussions with researchers affiliated with service research centers and networks located around the world and resulted in the following 12 service research priorities: stimulating service innovation, facilitating servitization, service infusion, and solutions, understanding organization and employee issues relevant to successful service, developing service networks and systems, leveraging service design, using big data to advance service, understanding value creation, enhancing the service experience, improving well-being through transformative service, measuring and optimizing service performance and impact, understanding service in a global context, and leveraging technology to advance service. For each priority, the authors identified important specific service topics and related research questions. Then, through an online survey, service researchers assessed the subtopics' perceived importance and the service field's extant knowledge about them. Although all the priorities and related topics were deemed important, the results show that topics related to transformative service and measuring and optimizing service performance are particularly important for advancing the service field along with big data, which had the largest gap between importance and current knowledge of the field. The authors present key challenges that should be addressed to move the field forward and conclude with a discussion of the need for additional interdisciplinary research.","['research priorities', 'service field', 'technology', 'transformative service research', 'innovation', 'cocreation', 'service design', 'big data', 'INFORMATION-SYSTEMS RESEARCH', 'DOMINANT LOGIC', 'VALUE CREATION', 'HEALTH-CARE', 'VALUE COCREATION', 'DESIGN SCIENCE', 'CO-CREATION', 'CUSTOMER', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'MANAGEMENT']","['research priorities', 'service field', 'technology', 'innovation', 'service design', 'big data', 'value creation', 'customer']","['innovation', 'performance']",0.5,0.125
"Relatively little is known about pricing in the export business, particularly how to organize and implement export pricing within firms and how these issues affect export performance. Therefore, this study investigates antecedents of export performance, specifically the organizational aspects of export pricing and price adaptation and the moderating role of export market characteristics, including export market turbulence, enforcement of contracts, and corruption ranks of the export market. Using a large-scale survey sample of 295 exporting firms in Austria and Germany and secondary data on the export markets involved, the authors show that both the intensity of internal pricing coordination and price adaptation have a positive effect on export performance. Specifically, in highly turbulent export markets, the intensity of internal pricing coordination contributes to export performance. Furthermore, a high level of horizontal dispersion of pricing authority is advisable in countries in which the enforcement of contracts is difficult.","['export pricing', 'export performance', 'price adaptation', 'pricing authority', 'export market turbulence', 'MEASURING ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'COMMON METHOD VARIANCE', 'MARKETING-STRATEGY', 'EMPIRICAL LINK', 'AGENCY THEORY', 'SALES FORCE', 'FIRM', 'STANDARDIZATION', 'CAPABILITIES', 'ORIENTATION']","['export pricing', 'export performance', 'price adaptation', 'pricing authority', 'export market turbulence', 'firm']","['export performance', 'adaptation', 'internal pricing coordination']",0.3333333333333333,0.16666666666666666
"The objective of this article is to elucidate how justice in general and distributive justice in particular are given sense to and made sense of in postmerger integration. Drawing on a longitudinal real-time analysis of a recent merger, we identify a pattern in which focus moved from equality to equity to less emphasis on distributive justice. To understand the dynamics involved, we develop a process model that explains how actors reconcile pressures of value creation and sociopolitical concerns in dialogical sensegiving and sensemaking processes that lead to the enactment of specific norms of justice. This analysis adds to research on mergers and acquisitions by facilitating understanding of the crucial role that norms of justice play in postmerger integration, of the way in which they change over time as integration processes unfold, and of the intergroup dynamics through which these norms of justice are enacted. By uncovering the microdynamics of dialogical sensegiving and sensemaking processes, we also contribute to research on organizational justice, sensemaking, and process studies.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE', 'POSTACQUISITION INTEGRATION', 'LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS', 'ACQUISITIONS', 'MERGERS', 'SENSEMAKING', 'FAIRNESS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'AMBIGUITY', 'PERFORMANCE']","['organizational justice', 'acquisitions', 'mergers', 'sensemaking']","['distributive justice', 'postmerger integration', 'sensegiving', 'sensemaking', 'mergers and acquisitions']",0.2,0.25
"Research summary: The dominant view has been that businesses that are more related to each other are more often combined within diversified firms. This study uses a dynamic model to demonstrate that, with inter-temporal economies of scope, diversified firms are more likely to combine moderately related businesses than the most-related businesses. That effect occurs because strong relatedness reduces redeployment costs and makes firms redeploy all resources to better performing businesses. The strength of that effect depends on inducements for redeployment measured as the current return advantage of one business over another business, volatilities of business returns, and correlation of those returns. This study develops hypotheses for those relationships and suggests empirical operationalizations, encouraging empiricists to retest the implications of relatedness for the dynamics of corporate diversification. Managerial summary: It is believed that diversified firms are more likely to combine more-related businesses because relatedness enables sharing of resources between businesses. Indeed, a firm can apply knowledge created in one business to another business, avoiding costly duplication in knowledge development. Resource sharing also adds value when a firm offers several products, adding the convenience of one-stop shopping and charging higher prices. However, resource sharing is not the only motivation for corporate diversification. In environments where profitability of businesses changes frequently, firms diversify by redeploying part of resources from an underperforming business to a better performing business. This study uses a dynamic model to demonstrate that, with that second motivation for corporate diversification, firms end up combining moderately related businesses rather than the most-related businesses.

"The advent of the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) in 1983 affected individual general hospitals in varying degrees based on their revenue and cost structures. These same factors served to constrain a hospital's ability to adapt to the post-PPS environment. The three constraints are based on the proportion of the hospital's private-pay (non-Medicare/Medicaid) patients, economies of scale and economies of scope among medical services. We test the relationship between these constraints and organizational failure in the Chicago area.

"Efforts to engage customers in cocreating new products have garnered much research attention from studies documenting customer cocreation's (CC's) positive impact on firm innovation and performance. Less research, however, has counterbalanced the bright side with the potential dark side of CC, especially as a strategy for multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in foreign markets. This study examines how MNC subsidiaries' CC affects new product innovativeness and knowledge leakage to competitors. Adopting a broader agency perspective to recognize that subsidiaries often do not perform up to headquarters' expectations due to both self-serving opportunism and honest incompetence, this study explores how CC effects are contingent on MNCs' global management mechanisms. Using a dyadic managerial survey of 238 MNC subsidiaries, the authors find that MNCs can control knowledge leakage by implementing proper global integration and local adaptation mechanisms. However, CC may not improve new product innovativeness, except when the subsidiary has low local research-and-development staff influence. This study contributes to the CC literature by showing its benefits, challenges, and boundary conditions as a growing MNC innovation strategy.","['customer cocreation', 'headquarters-subsidiary relationship', 'knowledge leakage', 'multinational corporations', 'new product development', 'INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'KNOWLEDGE CREATION', 'RESPONSIVENESS FRAMEWORK', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'SOCIAL-STRUCTURE', 'INNOVATION', 'HEADQUARTERS', 'MNC']","['customer cocreation', 'knowledge leakage', 'multinational corporations', 'research and development', 'innovation', 'headquarters', 'mnc']","['customer cocreation', 'innovation', 'multinational corporations', 'innovativeness', 'knowledge leakage', 'mnc innovation strategy']",0.6666666666666666,0.5714285714285714
"The present research leverages the irrational options theoretical framework to explore options rationality differences between salespeople and non-salespeople. Specifically, the reported research first examines (Study 1) whether or not salespeople are more likely to place a higher value on diminishing options than individuals who do not work in sales. Two follow-up studies embed a potential internal moderator (salesperson thinking style; Study 2) and a potential external moderator (performance-based incentives; Study 3) of salesperson valuations of diminishing options. The method employed in all three studies is an experimental design tailored after Shin and Ariely's (Management Science 50(5):575-586, 2004) seminal work on irrationality and options availability. The results demonstrate that, compared to non-salespeople, salespeople are more inclined to value option availability (Study 1), with this effect being especially pronounced for rule-bound thinkers (Study 2) and those operating under incentive-based compensation plans (Study 3).

"Although several studies have shown that inward foreign direct investment (FDI) often leads to greater host country productivity, researchers have yet to determine the relative importance of direct technology transfer and competitive pressure. To assess the relative importance of the two channels, we examine the US auto-component industry between 1979 and 1991. During this period, Japanese automobile assemblers began to produce vehicles in North America, and began to purchase inputs from US auto-component manufacturers. Those US manufacturers that sold components to Japanese transplants would be the direct recipients of any technologies transferred from the Japanese. Although we find that the direct investment by Japanese assemblers was associated with overall productivity improvement in the US auto-component industry, we find little evidence of direct technology transfer. The productivity growth of US suppliers affiliated with Japanese assemblers was no greater than that of other, non-affiliated US suppliers. Further, we find that the Japanese assemblers tended to purchase components from less productive US suppliers and, moreover, that low-productivity suppliers that sold goods to Japanese assemblers had a higher survival rate than low-productivity suppliers that did not sell to Japanese firms. The results suggest that increased competitive pressure in the auto-sector was the main cause of overall productivity improvement, at least during the initial stages of FDI of the 1980s.","['FDI', 'competition', 'productivity', 'automotive', 'UNITED-STATES', 'SPILLOVER EFFICIENCY', 'FIRM GROWTH', 'COMPETITION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'JAPANESE', 'DYNAMICS', 'MARKETS', 'PLANTS', 'LEVEL']","['fdi', 'productivity', 'japanese', 'plants']","['foreign direct investment', 'productivity', 'technology']",0.3333333333333333,0.25
"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine supplier financial risk through the lens of Enactment Theory, to explore the role of transparency and communication on buyers' perceptions of supplier default risk. The authors develop a theoretical model proposing that buyer communication with suppliers leads to preemptive actions that may prevent supplier financial default and fewer supply disruptions. The results suggest that reducing equivocality in buyers through communication with suppliers leads to understanding of financial factors not captured through third-party financial indicators, leading to proactive risk mitigation activities that prevent disruptions during recessionary economic cycles. This research proposes that transparency and communication reduces equivocality in buyers, spurring them to take contractual actions that reduces, financial default in key suppliers, which leads to fewer supply disruptions. Design/methodology/approach - Survey data collected from 175 firms in the North America and Brazil during a period of the global recession is used to test the impact of communication with suppliers on supply chain disruptions in periods of economic crisis. This relationship is mediated by proactive contract renegotiation and supplier financial health, supporting a model grounded in Enactment Theory. Findings - Results show that buyers who regularly assess and develop an understanding of their key suppliers' financial conditions are more likely to re-negotiate contracts that revise payment terms, leading to improved supplier working capital and fewer supply chain disruptions. Research limitations/implications - Validation of industry-specific financial ratios and figures could provide a richer set of insights and some quantitative measures for establishing baseline on what levels of financial ratios actually result in disruptions. However, future research should consider using a cross-sectional sample and, in addition, a qualitative approach to capture risk from a greater variety of industries and supply chain dynamics. Originality/value - The notion of effective communication flows as a means for reduction of supplier disruption risk is aligned with Enactment Theory views that emphasize the benefits of risk reduction. Equivocality is reduced in buyers through information exchange and formal assessments in complex environments. This research suggests that while such communication does not have a direct effect on supply disruption risk, it is mediated through proactive buyer actions to improve supplier financial health and contract re-negotiation mechanisms that may preempt financial distress. These are important lessons learned that provide guidelines for supply chain executives in future economic recessions that may occur in the coming years.","['Contracts', 'Social exchange theory', 'Supply chain disruptions', 'Supplier-manufacturer relationships', 'CHAIN DISRUPTIONS', 'OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT', 'DEFAULT', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'INFORMATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'WEALTH', 'ISSUES']","['contracts', 'supply chain disruptions', 'chain disruptions', 'default', 'information']","['financial risk', 'enactment theory', 'default', 'disruptions', 'crisis']",0.2,0.2

"It is often assumed that directors with human capital such as prior management experience or independence from the company are the most influential board members. By contrast, in a survey of all the board members in 14 companies we found that ties to others in a network of strong ties among those who meet outside of board meetings were more important predictors of social influence than human capital or ties across boards. These ties within the board represent the social capital of members in the form of prior relationships with other directors, ties to others on the board, and membership in cliques within the board's network of ties. These results support a social capital perspective on influence that emphasizes relationships with others on the board as important factors in the social dynamics of board decision-making.","['nan', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'POWER', 'PERFORMANCE', 'NETWORKS', 'STRATEGY', 'AGENCY', 'INDEPENDENCE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'COOPERATION', 'INTERLOCKS']",['independence'],[],0,0.0
"Corporate entrepreneurship (CE) which embodies a company's innovation and venturing activities, is necessary in today's competitive markets. CE is important for organizational renewal, the creation of new business, and improved performance. CE, however, requires strong and continued support from the company's top executives. Data from 231 medium-size manufacturing companies show that commitment to CE is high when: (1) executives own stock in their company; (2) the board chair and the chief executive officer are different individuals; (3) the board is medium in size; and, (4) outside directors own stock in the company. The relationships between the ratio of outside directors and CE, and institutional ownership and CE, are mixed. CE is also positively associated with future company performance.

"Most supermarket categories are cluttered with items, or stockkeeping units (SKUs), that differ very little at the attribute level. Previous research has found that reductions (up to 54%) in the number of low-selling SKUs need not affect perceptions of variety and therefore sales, significantly. In this research, the authors analyze data from a natural experiment conducted by an online grocer, in which 94% of the categories experienced dramatic cuts in the number of SKUs offered, particularly low-selling SKUs, Sales were indeed affected dramatically, increasing an average of 11% across the 42 categories examined. Sales rose in more than two-thirds of these categories, nearly half of which experienced an increase of 10% or more; 75% of households increased their overall expenditures after the cut in SKUs. In turn, the authors examine how different types of SKU reductions-defined by how the cuts affect the available attributes or features of a category (e.g., the number of brands)-affected purchase behavior differently. The results indicate that consumers experienced divergent reactions to the reduction in sizes, but they uniformly welcomed the elimination of clutter brought on by the reduction in redundant items. In addition, of households that were loyal to a single brand, size, or brand-size combination that was eliminated. nearly half continued purchasing within the category. Also, contrary to previous research on SKU reductions, the authors find that category sales depend on the total number of SKUs offered. The authors extend the previous research by showing that (1) category sales depend on the availability of key product and category attributes and (2) two particularly important attributes to consumers in an assortment are brand and flavor.","['nan', 'VARIETY', 'IMPACT', 'CHOICE']",['variety'],['perceptions'],0.0,0.0
"Extant research provides valuable knowledge about how firms can satisfy their customers. However, it is unclear how customers themselves contribute to their satisfaction. From a basis in the job demands-resources model, the authors propose a customer demands-resources model. In this model, customer demands (negative customer behaviors) and customer resources (positive customer behaviors) affect customer satisfaction through frontline employees' customer-oriented attitudes and customer-oriented behaviors. Using dyadic data from 141 frontline employees and 375 customers, this study identifies customer behaviors as an important source of customer satisfaction. Customer demands impede frontline employees' customer-oriented attitudes and customer satisfaction through frontline employees' emotional exhaustion, whereas customer resources indirectly increase customer satisfaction. Customer resources also buffer the negative effect of customer demands on frontline employees' customer-oriented attitudes.","['Customer demands-resourcesmodel', 'Support by customers', 'Customer satisfaction', 'Customer-oriented attitude', 'Customer-oriented behavior', 'DEMANDS-RESOURCES MODEL', 'JOB DEMANDS', 'EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION', 'PRODUCT INNOVATIVENESS', 'DOMINANT LOGIC', 'SERVICE', 'ORIENTATION', 'IMPACT', 'BEHAVIOR', 'ANTECEDENTS']","['customer satisfaction', 'customer oriented attitude', 'customer oriented behavior', 'demands resources model', 'job demands', 'emotional exhaustion', 'behavior']","['job demands resources model', 'behaviors']",0.0,0.0
"Are service firms that enact strategies to manage their new service development (NSD) knowledge able to generate a sustainable competitive advantage (SCA)? Based on analysis of data from a large survey of service companies, the answer is yes. The authors find that companies employing the knowledge management strategies of codification and personalization reflect higher levels of NSD knowledge. However, the two strategies vary in their individual performance outcomes, with codification promoting NSD proficiency (an ability to execute NSD activities) and personalization promoting greater NSD innovativeness (market perception of the company as novel and as an innovator). When used together, the two strategies magnify NSD knowledge, which when combined with NSD proficiency and NSD innovativeness, promote an SCA. Therefore, companies planning to invest in a knowledge management system should heed the outcomes desired from their NSD process. A system based on documentation exemplifies a codification strategy and will drive NSD proficiency; a system emphasizing interpersonal communication exemplifies a personalization strategy and will drive NSD innovativeness. A system that blends the two strategies appears the most advantageous for service companies' NSD efforts aiming to build a long-term sustainable competitive advantage.","['service development', 'knowledge management', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'FINANCIAL SERVICES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CAPABILITY', 'INTEGRATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'ORIENTATION']","['service development', 'knowledge management', 'performance']","['knowledge', 'competitive advantage', 'nsd proficiency']",0.0,0.0

In an initial study in which adolescents coded 194 advertisements, the authors identified seven common message themes. Using protection motivation theory, the authors develop hypotheses regarding the message theme effects on cognitions and intentions and test them in an experiment involving 1667 adolescents. Three of the seven message themes increased adolescents' nonsmoking intentions compared with a control; all did so by enhancing adolescents' perceptions that smoking poses severe social disapproval risks.

"We theorize on the performance implications of the timing at which entrepreneurs stop exploring their business opportunities and start exploiting them. Using an optimal-stopping approach, we characterize the time when exploitation should begin based primarily on when an entrepreneur's ignorance has been sufficiently reduced through knowledge accumulation. This ignorance threshold captures a tradeoff between the time needed to increase legitimacy and the necessity to act now to minimize competition. Changes in legitimacy and competition are based on how entrepreneurs manage their knowledge (tacit versus explicit) under differing degrees of novelty for the business opportunity. These changes, in turn, impact the performance and timing of opportunity exploitation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

"We partition the variances of market shares, which we use as surrogates for competitive position, of the business units of all public manufacturing companies available in the Trinet data base into industry factors, corporate parent-specific factors, and business unit-specific factors. Our results differ somewhat from Rumelt's (1991), which decomposed variances in profitability. We find that corporate parent effects on market share are considerably greater than zero when lines of business are defined more narrowly, when small business units are included, and when firms are medium-sized. Our results suggest that the relative importance of corporate, industry, and business unit effects depends on the types of criteria, such as the level of industry aggregation whether small business Emits are included, and firm size, that are used to construct samples.

"The authors present a phenomenological and longitudinal investigation of satisfaction, as revealed through consumers' ownership experiences with technological products. The study seeks to serve a provocative role in this mature research area by stepping back from the historically dominant comparison standards paradigm to question, invigorate, and, in certain ways, redirect satisfaction research along emergent lines. Although results show that the dominant paradigm of satisfaction and its competing models (i.e., those based on the confirmation/disconfirmation of preconsumption standards) are distinctly operative in some of the consumer cases, they are also found to be insufficient or even irrelevant in others. The authors consider several theoretical extensions in light of this learning and induct a new satisfaction paradigm. Overall, the findings support a more holistic, context-dependent, and dynamic process of satisfaction. This process is revealed as a multi-model, multi-modal blend of motivations, cognitions, emotions, and meanings, embedded in sociocultural settings, which transforms during progressive and regressive consumer-product interactions.","['nan', 'CONSUMER SATISFACTION', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'MODEL', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'CONSUMPTION', 'LIFE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'QUALITY']","['model', 'consumption']",['emotions'],0.0,0.0
"A measure of consumers' attitude toward private label brands is developed and its psychometric properties are assessed. Predictions are then tested regarding relationships between private label attitude and (1) latent perceptual and sales promotion constructs, and (2) purchase behaviors measured in a field setting The measure is positively related to value consciousness, deal proneness and smart-shopper self-perceptions, and negatively related to the propensity to be brand loyal and hold price-quality perceptions. Predictive validity of the private label measure is supported by a positive relationship with private label purchases from a grocery store shopping trip. Despite a positive relationship between the latent constructs of private label attitude and deal proneness, the consumer segment that allocated a high percentage of total purchases to private label products made fewer purchases on sale or with a coupon. These findings suggest that consumers may choose between price-related deals and private label purchases.","['nan', 'PRICE', 'PRONENESS', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'MATERIALISM', 'QUALITY']","['price', 'proneness', 'perceptions', 'quality']",[],0,0.0
"This study takes a population ecology perspective to uncover the influence that social venture creation exerts on commercial venture creation. Data from 88 Ohio counties during 2003-2007 uncovered a negative relationship suggesting that social ventures compete for resources with commercial ventures at the time of founding. Additionally, we found that income levels in the county affected the inter-population dynamics between social and commercial ventures. Specifically, lower income levels exacerbated the competitive relationship between social and commercial ventures. Low levels of government spending on welfare were found to suppress commercial start-up rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Front-end new product development (NPD) is fraught with tensions that fuel and inhibit innovation. According to paradox theory, tensions pose a double-edged sword, sparking learning and creativity or anxiety and counterproductive responses. NPD teams' shared understandingshow they think about (cognition) and approach (motivation) tensionsturn the sword. Existing literature examines innovation tensions and their management. Yet scholars call for deeper dives, seeking research that unpacks cognitive and motivational drivers underlying how NPD teams cope with tensions. This paper responds, presenting a four-year inductive study of five NPD consultancies. Across cases, findings explicate the roles of paradoxical cognitive frames and regulatory motivational focus. Across firms, the front-end NPD teams framed tensions paradoxically. Three framesguided freefall, benevolent dictatorship, and cohesive diversityhelped teams develop shared understandings of tensions as paradoxical, posing competing yet interdependent demands. Teams varied, however, in their regulatory focus, influencing how they applied the frames to approach tensions. In the most innovative case, teams applied a promotion focus, energized to explore tensions in search of more creative alternatives and synergies. In less innovative cases, teams applied a prevention focus, motivated to avoid risk and loss. Together, paradoxical frames and regulatory focus shaped teams' coping behaviors and resulting innovation. Resulting theory posits the interplay among cognitive, motivational, and behavioral drivers of innovation. Results offer three contributions. First, this study extends understanding of antecedents to team innovation and front-end NPD. Second, findings deepen insights into team cognition and paradoxical frames. Last, the theoretical framework explicates how cognitive-motivational interactions enable coping behaviors that foster innovation. The conclusion poses managerial and research implications. Building from paradox theory this study suggests means to foster shared paradoxical frames and promotion focus in NPD teams. Further, study limitations highlight opportunities to extend its generalizability and elaborate underlying drivers of innovation.","['nan', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'REGULATORY FOCUS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'WORK GROUPS', 'INNOVATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL', 'PARADOX', 'TECHNOLOGY']","['product development', 'regulatory focus', 'innovation', 'management', 'paradox']",[],0,0.0
"Much research has focused on how consumers and competitors respond to short-term changes in advertising and promotion. In contrast, the authors use Procter & Gamble's (P&G's) value pricing strategy as an opportunity to study consumer and competitor response to a major, sustained change in marketing-mix strategy. They compile data across 24 categories in which P&G has a significant market share, covering the period from 1990 to 1996, during which P&G instituted major cuts in deals and coupons and substantial increases in advertising. The authors estimate an econometric model to trace how consumers and competitors react to such changes. For the average brand, the authors find that deals and coupons increase market penetration and surprisingly have little impact on customer retention as measured by share-of-category requirements and category usage. For the average brand, advertising works primarily by increasing penetration, but its effect is weaker than that of promotion. The authors find that competitor response is related to how strongly the competitor's market share is affected by the change in marketing mix and the competitor's own response and to structural factors such as market share position and multimarket contact. The net impact of these consumer and competitor responses is a decrease in market share for the company that institutes sustained decreases in promotion coupled with increases in advertising.","['nan', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'BRAND CHOICE', 'MULTIMARKET CONTACT', 'PURCHASE INCIDENCE', 'ADVERTISING WORKS', 'IMPACT', 'PROMOTION', 'MODEL', 'SHARE', 'ENTRY']","['multimarket contact', 'advertising works', 'impact', 'promotion', 'model', 'share']","['marketing mix', 'market share', 'customer retention']",0.0,0.0

"The conventional system of paper checkbooks with multiple checks carries a significant risk of default because no form of authorization is required when individual checks are written, although implicitly each checkbook is authorized when it is issued to the payer. Nonetheless, checks are a less expensive payment method than credit cards, so they ore suitable for a high-credit business environment. To make up for the defect in the paper check system, whereby checks likely to default con be issued without authorization, the authors have devised an agent-based electronic check system known as SafeCheck that can monitor the situation and block the issuance of nonallowable checks in a distributed manner. Three types of service ore allowed, depending upon the check issuer's credibility. Members of the top credit class require authorization only for each checkbook. Members of the second-level credit class require authorization for each check. Members of the third-level credit class ore allowed to issue checks only within their checking account balance. The bank can dynamically adjust the credit level depending upon the record of defaults. The SafeCheck System consists of three agents: Checkbook Agent at the check issuer's site, Check-Receipt Agent at the check receiver's site, and the bank's Control Agents at the check issuer's and receiver's banks respectively. For security purposes, SafeCheck has public key cryptography, digital signatures, and certificate schemes like those of the SET protocol for credit cords. The essence of a checkbook agent can be stored in the IC card.","['check systems', 'default risk', 'electronic payments', 'intelligent agents', 'security', 'nan']",['security'],"['paper checkbooks', 'authorization', 'public key cryptography']",0.0,0.0
"In an emerging market context, this article examines the impact of early international market entry on marketing capability development and performance outcomes in young and small entrepreneurial firms. The authors identify the importance of marketing capabilities and the boundary conditions associated with international commitment, as well as the type of international market entered (developed vs. emerging market), to determine performance outcomes in early internationalization. With survey data from more than 300 senior managers in China, the results indicate that early foreign market entry enhances a young venture's marketing capabilities, which in turn leads to international growth. The findings also reveal that young ventures tend to be in a better position to improve their marketing capabilities when their senior management demonstrates a high level of commitment to foreign markets. Furthermore, the impact of marketing capabilities on the performance outcomes of early internationalization seems more salient among ventures that target developed, rather than emerging, foreign markets. Theoretically, through the lens of organizational learning and the development of marketing capabilities, this article contributes to the study of international new ventures by demonstrating that marketing capabilities serve as enabling factors that help young international ventures mitigate their liabilities of foreignness to achieve international performance outcomes.","['early internationalization', 'performance', 'marketing capabilities', 'learning', 'international commitment', 'BORN GLOBAL FIRM', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL PROCLIVITY', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'ENTRY', 'INNOVATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'INTENSITY', 'DIVERSITY']","['early internationalization', 'performance', 'marketing capabilities', 'learning', 'international commitment', 'entry']",['firms'],0.0,0.0
"The current research examines the conditions under which consumers demonstrate associative versus dissociative responses to identity-linked products as a consequence of a social identity threat. Across four studies, the authors test the notion that reactions to social identity threat may be moderated by self-construal by examining subcultural differences in ethnic background, priming self-construal, and investigating cross-national differences in cultural background. Those with more independent self-construals tend to avoid identity-linked products when that identity is threatened versus not threatened. Those with more interdependent self-construals, in contrast, demonstrate more positive preferences for identity-linked products when that aspect of social identity is threatened. These effects arise because, while independents are motivated to restore positive self-worth when a social identity is threatened, interdependents access a repertoire of social identities to fulfill belongingness needs when threatened.","['nan', 'COLLECTIVE SELF', 'UNITED-STATES', 'GROUP IDENTIFICATION', 'COLLEGE-STUDENTS', 'CULTURE', 'ESTEEM', 'ENHANCEMENT', 'PREFERENCES', 'PERSUASION', 'JAPAN']",['preferences'],[],0,0.0
"Innovation generation has increasingly been recognized as an outcome of interaction between a firm and various outside entities. According to this view, supplier involvement and alliances are routes to innovation generation. Despite this realization, there is a dearth of research, both conceptual and empirical, focusing on innovation generation in buyer-seller relationships in supply chains. In an attempt to fill this void, this article develops a conceptual model of innovation generation in buyer-seller relationships in upstream supply chains. The authors propose that innovation generation in supply chain relationships, both incremental and radical, is a consequence of interactions between buyers and sellers. They also delineate factors internal and external to the relationship that moderate the link between interaction and innovation generation.

"Purpose - This article aims to quantify and analyse empirically how the geographic dispersion of a firm's supply chain impacts on intra-firm supply chain performance. Design/methodology/approach - Generalised linear modelling is utilised to analyse a sample of 95 large manufacturing companies operating in Finland. Findings - Results indicate that the increased geographic dispersion of the upstream supply chain results in higher costs of warehousing and logistics administration. On the downstream side, inventory costs, inventory days of supply, and cash-to-cash cycle time tend to increase due to geographically dispersed sales network. Increased geographic dispersion in the upstream and downstream supply chain results in the decline of perfect orders, and increases order fulfilment cycle time. However, the increased dispersion of the production network reduces order fulfilment cycle time. The results also indicate that the larger the firm, the better it can alleviate the negative implications of dispersion on perfect order fulfilment. Make-to-stock companies suffer less from the supply chain dispersion related delays in comparison to companies that utilise more pull-type production and inventory strategies. Research limitations/implications - Research limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the data, the concentrated geographic origin of the respondents, and the small sample size. Originality/value - Building on the multidisciplinary body of prior literature on geographic dispersion, the research provides quantified insights into the general principles of international supply chain design in the presence of a performance related trade-off between the dispersion and centralisation of operations across the tiers of the supply chain. Contributions are made to the discussions on supply chain complexity, international sales portfolio diversification and international purchasing.","['International business', 'Supply chain management', 'Geographic dispersion', 'Performance', 'Finland', 'Company performance', 'Business-to-business marketing', 'COST', 'LOGISTICS', 'COMPLEXITY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'BUSINESS', 'DISTANCE', 'FLEXIBILITY', 'ENTERPRISE', 'DYNAMICS', 'LOCATION']","['geographic dispersion', 'performance', 'finland', 'cost', 'logistics', 'complexity']","['geographic dispersion', 'finland']",1.0,0.3333333333333333
"We propose that what consumers buy can be systematically influenced by how much they buy. We hypothesize that, as the number of items purchased in a category on a shopping occasion increases, a consumer is more likely to select product variants (e.g., yogurt flavors) that s/he does not usually purchase. We used yogurt scanner data to support this hypothesis. This study also revealed that consumers were more likely to select their regular brands when purchasing more containers of yogurt on a given occasion. A laboratory experiment showed that this reflects the combined impact of purchase quantity and product-display format (i.e., the by-brand display of yogurt in supermarkets) on consumer choice.","['nan', 'SEEKING BEHAVIOR', 'CHOICE']",['choice'],['supermarkets'],0.0,0.0

Moreover, we find that the moderating effect of financial slack on HR slack in the strategic change context operates through changes in organizations' human capital investment, offering a unique examination of a key mechanism through which slack resources create value and through which complementarities between different types of slack come to fruition.

"Entrepreneurial action is central to entrepreneurship theory, and is broadly seen to arise as a consequence of intendedly rational logics (whether causal or effectual), reflecting reasoned judgment. But, is this always the case? While entrepreneurial action may often be the result of a judgmental decision (between alternative courses of action/inaction), the presumption that reasoned judgment encompasses all the motives, modes and mechanisms leading to entrepreneurial outcomes seems dubious. Building on an emerging literature that seeks to address the boundaries of reasoned entrepreneurial action, we develop the notion that non-deliberative impulse-driven behavioral logics can also be the basis for business venturing. Our framework offers a complementary perspective to the intendedly-rational, deliberate logics perspective, opening novel pathways for future research and theory-building.","['Impulse-driven logics', 'Non-deliberative pathways', 'Entrepreneurial action', 'Business venturing', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Disinhibition', 'PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY', 'BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION', 'OPPORTUNITIES', 'ORGANIZATION', 'INTENTION', 'DISCOVERY', 'FIELD', 'ADHD', 'TIME']","['entrepreneurial action', 'business venturing', 'entrepreneurship']","['entrepreneurial action', 'entrepreneurship', 'logics', 'reasoned judgment', 'impulse driven behavioral logics']",0.4,0.6666666666666666

"A limited number of studies have addressed the idea of 'strategic' reward systems-the matching of compensation systems to a firm's strategy. Prior research on this topic has been confined to U.S. firms, however, and a number of key questions remain unanswered. Using a sample of 917 employees from two large Swiss financial institutions, we found that pay systems are linked with divisional strategic orientation, but in a different form than prior studies. Additionally, we identify hierarchical position as an important variable in the tailoring of reward systems. Hierarchy has a significant main effect on pay plan design, and an interactive effect with strategic orientation.

"Reference price research suggests that consumers memorize and recall price information when selecting brands for frequently purchased products. Previous price-knowledge surveys, however, indicate that memory for prices is lower than expected. In this study, the authors show that these price-knowledge surveys provide imperfect estimates of price knowledge, because they focus only on recall and short-term memory. The authors propose, instead, to use a combination of price recall, price recognition, and deal recognition to measure the degree to which consumers use auditory verbal, visual Arabic, or analogue magnitude representations to memorize prices. The authors show how the combination of these three measures provides a much richer understanding of consumers' knowledge of prices. The results suggest that the price knowledge involved in reference prices may often not be accessible to recall but shows up in price recognition and deal recognition. In addition, the authors identify consumer and product characteristics that explain the variations in price knowledge. They find, for example, that frequent promotions increase consumers' ability to remember regular prices and that store switchers do not possess better price knowledge than other shoppers.","['nan', 'INFORMATION', 'SEARCH', 'MARKET']","['information', 'search']",[],0,0.0

"We conduct a firm-level, 6-year longitudinal analysis on the impact that racial diversity in human resources has on financial performance. When considering short-term performance outcomes, we predict a curvilinear relationship between diversity and performance (i.e., firm productivity). Although we find evidence of a U-shaped relationship between racial diversity and productivity, the relationship is stronger in service-oriented relative to manufacturing-oriented industries and in more stable vs. volatile environments. For longer-term profitability, we propose and find support for more of a positive linear relationship between diversity and performance (i.e., Tobin's q) than a nonlinear one. This linear effect is stronger and more positive in munificent compared to resource-scare environments. Thus, we aid in reconciling existing, often contradictory, studies by demonstrating the potential short-term vs. long-term impact of racial diversity on performance. We offer implications for future research on diversity considering the current and projected demographic landscape.

"The principal-principal perspective is tested and extended in the context of corporate takeovers of Chinese publicly listed firms from 1998 to 2007. The resistance of a target firm's controlling shareholder toward potential takeovers reflects the conflict between the principal and minority shareholders. It was found that this resistance weakens when target firms are located in regions with more institutional development, where the minority shareholders' interests are better protected. The resistance also decreases for target firms with CEOs who are politically connected, as these CEOs may be more interested in their own political careers than in representing the interests of the controlling shareholders.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","['takeovers', 'principal-principal conflicts', 'political connections', 'institutional development', 'China', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'TRANSITION ECONOMY', 'MARKET', 'ACQUISITIONS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'GOVERNANCE', 'STRATEGIES', 'DIRECTORS']","['takeovers', 'institutional development', 'perspective']","['corporate takeovers', 'institutional', 'ceos']",0.0,0.0
"Information technologies (IT) have affected economic activities within and beyond the boundaries of the firm, changing the face of e-commerce. This article explores the circumstances under which value is created in business networks made possible by IT. Business networks combine the capabilities of multiple Firms to produce and deliver products and services that none of them could more economically produce on its own and for which there is demand in the market. We call this business network-based value creation. We apply economic theory to explain the conditions under which business networks will exist and are able to sustain their value-producing activities. Informedness has the potential to increase the complexity of consumer demand. Addressing this demand requires flexible production and delivery of products and services, and can be achieved by value-adding business networks supported by IT, standardized technology, and business process solutions. We also examine the benefits associated with business network-based value creation and fair value-sharing to support the sustainability of business networks. We develop a set of propositions and draw upon multiple case examples from the travel and hospitality industry to validate our theoretical perspectives on business network-based value creation. The results demonstrate that this industry is going through a digital transformation that makes it possible for many firms to engage in highly effective and innovative network-based value creation.","['Business networks', 'case studies', 'e-commerce', 'economic theory', 'network stability', 'network sustainability', 'theory development', 'travel and hospitality industry', 'value creation', 'value sharing', 'INFORMATION', 'SYSTEMS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'STRATEGY', 'MARKETS']","['business networks', 'e commerce', 'economic theory', 'travel and hospitality industry', 'value creation', 'value sharing', 'information']",['networks'],0.0,0.0

"The authors examine the effects of organizational learning on customer orientation and relationship commitment in the global supply chain. To examine the effects of exposure to organizational learning, the authors test the hypotheses in low- versus high-learning groups in two different samples. The user sample consists of 175 users, representing the international strategic business units of one U.S.-based multinational corporation (i.e., strategic business units located outside the home country of the United States). The buyer sample consists of the corporate buyers of 200 multinational corporations, and the focus is on their supply chain activities worldwide. The authors examine the activities and relationships between II) users and buyers (as perceived by the users) and (2) buyers and suppliers las perceived by the buyers) in the supply chain. Overall, the results suggest that facets of organizational learning have a positive influence on customer orientation and relationship commitment in the global supply chain.

"Considerable research has explored the variables that affect the success of newcomer on-boarding, socialization, and retention. We build on this research by examining how newcomer socialization is affected by the degree to which newcomers' peers and leaders provide them with positive feedback. We refer to newcomers' perceptions of this feedback as social validation. This study examines the impact of social validation from peers and leaders on the development of organizational identification over time and the turnover attitudes of new employees. We found that perceptions of social validation significantly predicted how new employees used coping strategies to adapt to their new role over time, and consequently the development of identification and turnover intentions. Specifically, increased peer social validation predicted a greater use of positive coping strategies to engage with the new organization over time, and less use of disengagement coping strategies. In contrast, initial leader validation decreased newcomers' disengagement from the organization over time. These results highlight the role of the social environment in the workplace in temporally shaping and validating newcomers' adaptation efforts during transitions.","['social validation', 'socialization', 'organizational identification', 'GOODNESS-OF-FIT', 'INFORMATION-SEEKING', 'SELF', 'PERFORMANCE', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'OUTCOMES', 'STRESS', 'PERSONALITY', 'TURNOVER', 'QUESTIONNAIRE']","['social validation', 'socialization', 'organizational identification', 'identification', 'turnover']","['organizational identification', 'turnover']",1.0,0.4
"Treating customers as passive recipients of service recovery does not account for their naturally elevated desire for control following a service failure. Focusing on value cocreation by customers in service recovery, this study conceptualizes three types of customer perceived control in service recovery: process control, decision control, and information control. Using both a field study and a controlled experiment to test the conceptual model, this study reveals various ways service firms can engage customers in service recovery to enhance their service experience. The results show that customers are motivated to exert influence on and regain control over service recovery because they care not only about the economic gains rendered by control but also about their social self-esteem in their relationship with a service firm. An investigation of the interaction effects among the three types of control reveals either complementary or substitution effects between different pairings of the three types of control on customers' justice evaluations of service recovery and repurchase intentions. The findings provide managers with new guidance on developing and implementing successful service recovery programs.","['perceived control', 'perceived justice', 'cocreation', 'service recovery', 'outcome favorability', 'relationship-based self-esteem', 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE', 'SATISFACTION', 'PARTICIPATION', 'ENCOUNTERS', 'OUTCOMES', 'FAILURE', 'VOICE']","['perceived control', 'cocreation', 'service recovery', 'failure']","['service recovery', 'value cocreation', 'customer perceived control', 'social self esteem']",0.25,0.25

The results show that jointly announced corporate name changes and business restructuring are significantly more informative than the sum of their individual effects. The results further suggest that the information complementarity arises because corporate brand name changes resolve uncertainty and help in coordinating business restructuring initiatives.

"By 2011, approximately 83% of Fortune 500 companies were using some form of social media to connect with consumers. Furthermore, surveys suggest that consumers are increasingly relying on social media to learn about unfamiliar brands. However, best practices regarding the use of social media to bolster brand evaluations in such situations remain undefined. This research focuses on one practice in this domain: the decision to hide or reveal the demographic characteristics of a brand's online supporters. The results from four studies indicate that even when the presence of these supporters is only passively experienced and virtual (a situation the authors term mere virtual presence), their demographic characteristics can influence a target consumer's brand evaluations and purchase intentions. The findings suggest a framework for brand managers to use when deciding whether to reveal the identities of their online supporters or to retain ambiguity according to (1) the composition of existing supporters relative to targeted new supporters and (2) whether the brand is likely to be evaluated singly or in combination with competing brands.","['social influence', 'mere presence', 'social media', 'social networks', 'ambiguity', 'IDENTITY', 'PRODUCT', 'SELF', 'DISTINCTIVENESS', 'SIMILARITY', 'COMMUNITY', 'OTHERS', 'SALES']","['social media', 'ambiguity']","['social media', 'online', 'virtual presence']",0.3333333333333333,0.5
"Research summary: Startups often compete with diversifying entrants in the technology race to define dominant designs, which can be platform technology-based or non-platform technology-based. However, little research has examined the relative risk of technological exits for startups vs. diversifying entrants in such dominance battles. We develop a contingency framework that links a firm's technology exit to its pre-entry experience and the characteristics of the dominance battle. With a sample of 134 technologies involved in 31 dominance battles in the information technology industry from 1979 to 2007, we show that technologies of startups were more likely than those of diversifying entrants to exit from platform technology-based dominance battles; however, this relationship did not exist in non-platform technology-based dominance battles, or after the emergence of dominant designs.Managerial summary: How can a startup that tries to create a dominant design strategize to survive the fierce technology race? This study demonstrates that choosing the right battlefield is of paramount importance. Two aspects of a battlefield are shown as relevant: the type of technology and the stage of industrial evolution. Our results show that technologies sponsored by startups tend to have higher exit rates than those sponsored by diversifying entrants in dominance battles characterized by platform technologies, but this penalty is not evident in dominance battles characterized by non-platform technologies or after the emergence of dominant designs. Furthermore, our study suggests that lack of organizational legitimacy, complementary assets, and integrative capabilities may explain why startups have a higher risk of technology exit than diversifying entrants.

"Based on the eclectic theory of entrepreneurship, this article analyzes macro-level determinants of national rates of formal versus informal entrepreneurship. Our evaluation of the factors identified in this theory reveals a set of empirically-testable, higher-order determinants: economic opportunities, quality of governance, macro-level resources and abilities, performance-based culture and socially-supportive culture. The results of our analysis obtained through the PLS (partial least squares) approach to structural equation modeling contribute to the entrepreneurship literature by providing an empirically-supported model that shows how formal and informal entrepreneurship are driven differently. This model clarifies the conflicting findings in previous research about the effects of socioeconomic, institutional, and cultural factors on entrepreneurship rates across countries.

"Despite the popularity and extensive use of engaging users in crowdvoting, very little research has been conducted into the appropriateness of users as substitutes for experts when judging ideas. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the appropriateness of using users as a proxy for professional experts during the initial idea screening of new product/ service ideas. In other words, are users' assessments during idea screening conformant with professional experts' assessments and are they reliable as a proxy for experts during idea screening? In a comparative study, two different approaches to outsourcing the screening of wireless ideas to users are examined, including assessment by two different user panels: (1) technically skilled users and (2) technically naive users. These two approaches were compared with the assessments made by professional experts. The results showed no conformance between users and experts when comparing their absolute scores. However, during a relative comparison (the ranking of ideas), both user panels were conformant with the professional experts. A test of the user panels' ability to select the same top ideas as the professional experts was successful, indicating good conformance between the user panels and the professional experts. This paper's contribution is knowledge of how conformant external users are compared with professional expert judges during idea screening. The results indicate that companies can employ users during the initial screening process using criteria assessment to select the best ideas for further elaboration, something that would significantly reduce the number of ideas. The paper suggests an alternative design to crowdvoting, whereby the users assess the relevant criteria.","['nan', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'INNOVATION', 'CRITERIA', 'SUCCESS', 'COMMUNITIES', 'INFORMATION', 'EXPLORATION', 'DELL', 'END']","['criteria', 'success']","['experts', 'professional experts']",0.0,0.0

"Emerging economies provide a laboratory for investigating the interaction between firm strategies and local contexts. Mike Wright and colleagues have shaped this research agenda by creating legitimacy for this line of research, and by outlining how research in four types of strategy contexts can advance theories. We assess how this agenda has progressed in eight leading journals in the past decade, particularly during the five years following their review, with the aims to identify broad trends of theorizing, and to outline future research challenges. Emerging economy contexts challenge some of the assumptions of theories originally developed for markets that are relatively stable and efficient. Researchers have advanced several theoretical perspectives by addressing these challenges.

We apply event study methodology to the complete population of firms' announcements of open source activities, an open innovation model for software development that is novel and defies the extant dominant logic of software production and valorization.

"A variety of empirical findings reviewed in this research support the general thesis that the affective system of judgment and decision making is inherently anchored in the present. Building on this thesis, this research advances the specific hypothesis that affective feelings are relied on more (weighted more heavily) in judgments whose outcomes and targets are closer to the present than in those whose outcomes and targets are temporally more distant. Results from five experiments show that temporal proximity (a) amplifies the relative preference for options that are affectively superior and (b) increases the effects of incidental affect on evaluations. These effects are observed when compared to a more distant future as well as to a more distant past, and (c) they appear to be linked to a greater perceived information value of affective feelings in judgments whose outcomes and targets are closer to the present.

The literature on the four dimensions of empowerment (i.e., meaning, competence, self-determination, and impact) is reviewed and theoretical logic is developed linking the dimensions to specific outcomes. The expected relationships are tested on a sample of managers from diverse units of a manufacturing organization and then replicated on an independent sample of lower-level employees in a service organization using alternative measures of the outcome variables. The results, largely consistent across the two samples, suggest that different dimensions are related to different outcomes and that no single dimension predicts all three outcomes.

"Despite the prevalent use of loyalty programs, there is limited evidence on the long-term effects of such programs, and their effectiveness is not well established. The current research examines the long-term impact of a loyalty program on consumers' usage levels and their exclusive loyalty to the firm. Using longitudinal data from a convenience store franchise, the study shows that consumers who were heavy buyers at the beginning of a loyalty program were most likely to claim their qualified rewards, but the program did not prompt them to change their purchase behavior. In contrast, consumers whose initial patronage levels were low or moderate gradually purchased more and became more loyal to the firm. For light buyers, the loyalty program broadened their relationship with the firm into other business areas. The findings suggest a need to consider consumer idiosyncrasies when studying loyalty programs and illustrate consumers' cocreation of value in the marketing process.","['nan', 'CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT', 'REWARD', 'RETENTION', 'SHARE', 'PROFITABILITY', 'SATISFACTION', 'DETERMINANT', 'PROMOTIONS', 'QUANTITY', 'CHOICE']",['reward'],['loyalty programs'],0.0,0.0

Some schools adopted recycling programs that entailed the creation of new, full-time recycling manager positions that were filled by ecological activists. Other schools adopted more minimalist programs that were staffed by current employees who were more ecologically ambivalent and assumed recycling management responsibilities as a part-time, additional duty. Results of a subsequent survey of a population of colleges and universities show that this variation in staffing was importantly shaped by the Student Environmental Action Coalition, a national social movement organization that provided resources and support to student environmental groups at particular schools.

"This paper examines the link between consensus among senior managers and performance at the SBU level and considers factors which may moderate the strength of this relationship. Using data from a cross-national study in three industry sectors, the authors find that consensus increases the performance of the SBU in the case of a differentiation strategy but not in the case of a low-cost strategy. Additionally, the relationship between consensus on a differentiation strategy and performance is negatively influenced by dynamism of the market. This research thus clarifies and extends prior consensus research by indicating the conditions under which consensus positively affects performance. For managers, our results indicate that investing managerial time in obtaining consensus is more important for a differentiation than for a low-cost strategy and is particularly important when using a differentiation strategy in a stable environment.

"Concentration on consumption in material environments characterized by too much rather than too little creates important gaps in the understanding of how much of the earth's population navigates the marketplace. This study investigates bottom-of-the-pyramid, or impoverished, consumers to better comprehend the relationship between societal poverty and individual life satisfaction as moderated by psychological need deprivation and described by self-determination theory. Data were gathered from more than 77,000 individuals in 51 of the world's poorest countries. Using hierarchical linear models, results show that relatedness and autonomy improve poverty's negative influence on life satisfaction, but only if basic life necessities are available, described as consumption adequacy. Findings illustrate that without consumption adequacy, psychological need fulfillment has little effect on the poverty-well-being relationship, emphasizing the hopelessness of individuals living in extreme poverty. Findings also suggest to researchers that impoverished consumers not only face different circumstances but actually respond to those circumstances in unique ways.","['nan', 'HAPPINESS', 'POVERTY', 'PSYCHOLOGY', 'CULTURE', 'NEED', 'PERSONALITY', 'POSSESSIONS', 'CONSUMERS', 'AUTONOMY', 'HOMELESS']","['poverty', 'need', 'consumers', 'autonomy']","['consumption', 'bottom of the pyramid', 'poverty', 'life satisfaction', 'psychological need deprivation', 'self determination theory', 'relatedness', 'autonomy']",0.25,0.5
"In this study, we examine how relational capital and commitment affect a venture capital firm's (i.e., VCFs) perception of the performance of its portfolio companies (i.e., PFCs). That is, we examine how perceived performance is affected by the social nature of the relationship between the VCF and PFC. The study's hypotheses are tested by applying quantitative analyses to survey data collected from 298 U.S.-based venture capital firms. The data from the survey are complemented with additional information drawn from secondary data sources and interviews with several venture capitalists. We found that the amount of relational capital embedded in the VCF-PFC dyad and the extent to which the VCF is committed to the PFC are strongly related to perceived performance. We speculate that relational capital and commitment enhance learning, an effect that increases VCFs' perceptions of performance. Further, these perceptions of performance will also be amplified by the positive affect generated by relational capital and commitment. We discuss the limitations and contributions of our findings and provide directions for future research. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

"The value-based approach to strategy argues that a firm's ability to capture value depends on the extent of its added value. In this paper, I empirically test the link between added value and value capture using a longitudinal dataset of United Kingdom law firm performance, capabilities, and client relationships. In this setting, competitors relevant for defining a firm's added value are those that share a client with the firm. Further, within a client relationship, value creation, and hence added value, can be decomposed in two parts: product-line capability and client-specific scope economies. I find that added value, measured at the level of each buyer-supplier relationship, is a driver of relationship stability and supplier profitability. This suggests that suppliers with similar capabilities might enjoy different economic returns depending on the composition of their set of relevant competitors. These findings shed light on the conditions under which firms can appropriate returns from their capabilities. They indicate that concepts from cooperative games can be fruitfully applied to empirical studies of firm performance and to the elaboration of insights from the resource-based view of the firm.

"Research on strategic decision making has considered advice-seeking behaviour as an important top management team attribute that influences organizational outcomes. Yet, our understanding about how top management teams utilize advice to modify current strategies and pursue exploratory innovation is still unclear. To uncover the importance of advice seeking, we delineate between external and internal advice seeking and investigate their impact on exploratory innovation. We also argue that top management team heterogeneity moderates the impact of advice seeking on exploratory innovation. Findings indicated that both external and internal advice seeking are important determinants of a firm's exploratory innovation. In addition, we observed that top management team heterogeneity facilitates firms to act upon internal advice by combining different perspectives and developing new products and services. Interestingly, heterogeneous top management teams appeared to be less effective to leverage external advice and pursue exploratory innovation.","['nan', 'STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING', 'ORGANIZATIONAL ANTECEDENTS', 'EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION', 'INTERRATER AGREEMENT', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'SOCIAL NETWORKS', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'MARKET ENTRY', 'WEAK TIES', 'KNOWLEDGE']",['strategic decision making'],[],0,0.0

The results generally support the hypotheses that client-perceived performance is impacted by a firm's internal resources (e.g., technical skills, customer orientation, innovation). In addition, this relationship is contingent upon the COO effect, while client-perceived value is moderated by the client's buying experience. The findings can guide practitioners as to the key drivers of client-perceived value, and under what conditions this value is maximized.","['professional services', 'international services marketing', 'client-perceived value', 'perceived performance', 'resource-based view', 'BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'CORPORATE IMAGE', 'MODEL', 'QUALITY', 'FIRMS', 'DETERMINANTS']","['client perceived value', 'perceived performance', 'resource based view', 'business to business', 'resource based view', 'model']","['value', 'country of origin', 'performance', 'customer orientation innovation']",0.0,0.0
"This research examines the regulatory fit effect on perceived value and buying intentions in the context of private health insurance decisions. The so-called value-from-fit effect is assessed in conjunction with the effect of risk perceptions. Value-from-fit results from the interaction effect between regulatory focus concerns ( discount vs. cost-sharing policies) and message framing ( gain vs. loss). The results show that the fit effect on buying intentions is fully mediated by the perceived value of a health insurance policy and that perceived value functions as partial mediator of the effect of risk perceptions. The relative strength of the regulatory fit effect in explaining customer perceived value is small compared with the impact of perceived risk. The findings suggest that if health insurance providers wish to offer a premium discount, communicating the policy by emphasizing the benefits consumers attain from purchasing a deductible policy (i.e., getting the discount) may enhance the value of the policy. On the other hand, positioning a premium copayment policy can be more effectively done by emphasizing the costs associated with not choosing this policy.","['insurance decisions', 'framing', 'service pricing', 'regulatory fit', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'HEALTH-INSURANCE', 'RISK', 'PLS', 'WILLINGNESS', 'INFORMATION', 'DEDUCTIBLES', 'PREVENTION', 'PROMOTION', 'ATTITUDES']","['insurance decisions', 'framing', 'regulatory fit', 'health insurance', 'risk']","['fit', 'perceived value', 'buying intentions', 'message framing', 'perceived value']",0.0,0.0
"Through an inductive, comparative study of four early entrants in the nascent air taxi market, we examine why start-ups, generally characterized as flexible, malleable entities, might instead exhibit inertial behavior. While two of the firms engaged in ongoing experimentation and adaptation, two firms actively reinforced their original venture concepts, even in the face of environmental shifts and declining firm performance. Comparisons of the firms revealed the importance of founders' identities. Two founders saw themselves as revolutionaries building novel ventures to drive radical change. In contrast, two sets of founders saw themselves as discoverers identifying new opportunities and exploiting them to build successful businesses. We propose that these identities contributed to the firms' inertia and flexibility primarily through the mechanism of identity affirmation. Acting in a manner consistent with their self-views, revolutionary founders committed to and actively reinvested in radical venture concepts, rejecting potentially adaptive changes that they felt compromised novelty. In contrast, discoverer founders prioritized experimentation and change in reaction to shifting conditions. We propose an emergent framework exploring how, in a nascent industry, a founder's identity can set off self-reinforcing cycles of firm inertia or flexibility.","['entrepreneurship', 'organizational change', 'adaptation', 'founder identity', 'nascent industries', 'TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE', 'DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY', 'SECURITIES ANALYSTS', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'MARKET', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ENTREPRENEURS', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'CAPABILITIES', 'FIRMS']","['adaptation', 'market', 'performance', 'firms']",['performance'],1.0,0.25
"This paper addresses the question of how an established firm can successfully defend its market against current and future competitors. Previous studies on this issue are surprisingly scarce and typically concentrate on only a single generic defense strategy. Thus, little is known about the degree and the manner in which different generic defense strategies, such as a deterrence strategy (pursued before competitor market entry) and a shakeout strategy (pursued after competitor market entry), differ in effectiveness and efficiency and about the corresponding role of product and market conditions. As these strategies tend to be costly, an established firm must decide which of these strategies to focus its scarce resources on. Drawing on evolutionary game theory and an empirical calibration and validation study, this paper seeks to fill these research gaps. While both strategies turn out to be viable options for market defense, the authors find that in general, a shakeout strategy tends to be superior to a deterrence strategy. However, the authors also identify product and market conditions under which an established firm is better off focusing on a deterrence strategy. In methodological respects, the paper contributes to the marketing discipline by introducing evolutionary game theory, which has not been used previously for analyzing marketing issues, as well as an evolutionary approach to research on market defense.","['Marketing strategy', 'Competitor strategy', 'Competition', 'Evolutionary game theory', 'COMPETITIVE REACTIONS', 'SWITCHING COSTS', 'MARKET ENTRY', 'CONSUMER', 'MODELS', 'BARRIERS', 'REPUTATION', 'DECISIONS', 'FRAMEWORK', 'DYNAMICS']","['evolutionary game theory', 'market entry']","['shakeout', 'evolutionary game theory']",0.5,0.5
"Much of the recent research on executive characteristics focuses on attributes that society tends to view negatively, such as self-interest, self-serving bias, and narcissism. While providing insights into how executives' impact organizational outcomes, there may be attributes more positively viewed by society present in top management teams (TMTs) that have been overlooked, specifically TMT modesty. Though modesty deviates from the conventional view of executives, evidence from social psychology suggests that modesty positively impacts career success and upward mobility, suggesting that at least some individuals that rise to the level of the TMT are more modest than previously expected. Building on this insight, we argue that TMT modesty both elicits positive investor reactions following earnings calls and corresponds with higher levels of firm performance.","['modesty', 'top management team', 'CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT', 'EXECUTIVE PERSONALITY', 'INFORMATION-CONTENT', 'SELF-PRESENTATION', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'FIRM', 'STRATEGY']","['modesty', 'top management team', 'firm']","['top management teams', 'firm performance']",0.0,0.0
"Purpose-With increasing exposure to disruptions, it is vital for supply chains to manage risks proactively. Prediction of potential failure points and overall impact of these risks is challenging. In this paper, systems thinking concepts are applied for modelling supply chain risks. The purpose of this paper is to develop a holistic, systematic and quantitative risk assessment process for measuring the overall risk behaviour. Design/methodology/approach-A framework for supply chain risk management (SCRM) is developed and tested using an industrial case study. A systematically developed research design is employed to capture the dynamic behaviour of risks. Additionally, a system-based supply chain risk model is conceptualized for risk modelling. Sensitivity modelling results are combined for validating the supply chain risk model. Findings-The systems approach for modelling supply chain risks predicts the failure points along with their overall risk impact in the supply chain network. System-based risk modelling provides a holistic picture of risk behavioural performance, which is difficult to realise through other research methodologies commonly preferred in SCRM research. Practical implications-The developed framework for SCRM is tested in an industry setting for its viability. The framework for SCRM along with the supply chain risk model is expected to benefit practitioners in understanding the intricacies of supply chain risks. The system model for risk assessment is a working tool which could provide a perspective of future disruptive events. Originality/value-A holistic, systematic and quantitative risk modelling mechanism for capturing overall behaviour of risks is a valuable contribution of this research.

"We develop a conceptual understanding of when and how organizations respond to normative pressures. More precisely, we examine two main factors underlying the willingness and ability of organizations to respond to an issue: issue salience and the cost-benefit analysis of resource mobilization. We suggest that decision makers' interpretation of issue salience in conjunction with their perception of the costs and benefits of taking action to address the issue generates five potential responses: symbolic compliance and symbolic conformity, substantive compliance and substantive conformity, and inaction. We extend the baseline model by examining a number of boundary conditions. By focusing on the willingness and ability of organizations to respond to normative pressures, and by adopting the issue as the unit of analysis, our model helps explain intraorganizational as well as interorganizational response heterogeneity to institutional complexity.

"This study proposes a typology of reasons why people substantially delay important consumer decisions. The delay reasons we study are drawn from delay typologies identified in other contexts as well as from the product diffusion literature. Two studies reported here examine why subjects delay consumer decisions. These support most of the reasons in the proposed typology, while some unanticipated delay reasons also emerge. We find that the delay reasons are related to the reasons consumers stop delaying, a process that we call delay closure, and are also related to the amount of time that consumers spend in different stages of the decision-making process. A final study supports a conceptual framework to classify these delay reasons based on the two dimensions of internal versus external locus of causation, and whether the purpose of delay is related to the decision or to unrelated activities.","['nan', 'DIFFUSION-MODELS', 'EXTERNAL SEARCH', 'PROCRASTINATION', 'PURCHASE', 'PRICE', 'TIME', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'INFORMATION', 'JUDGMENTS', 'BEHAVIOR']",['time'],"['diffusion', 'decision']",0.0,0.0

"This paper develops a realistic real option theory of resource allocation decisions in strategic factor markets. Competitive advantage in factor markets is underpinned by market failures that allow firms to acquire assets at less than their value in use. We recognize that market failure may result from uncertainty regarding the current and/or future value of an asset, which map, respectively, to uncertainty as modeled in the feedback learning and real options literatures. The realistic real option framework we develop grafts insights from the strategic factor market, feedback learning, and real option valuation literatures. We argue that competitive advantage may emerge not only from luck, or ex ante differences in information or complementary assets, but also because firms differ in a specific type of learning abilitythe ability to integrate new information to exercise a contingent claim on an asset in a factor market. We dimensionalize these differences in terms of information processing and belief updating, argue that these differences lead to different resource allocation decisions, and suggest how these decisions may generate competitive advantage.","['real option logic', 'decision making under uncertainty', 'competitive advantage', 'competitive heterogeneity', 'sequential decision making', 'strategic decision making', 'TOP MANAGEMENT TEAM', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITIES', 'DESIGNING ORGANIZATIONS', 'CAPITAL-INVESTMENT', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'PROCESS MODEL', 'VIEW', 'INFORMATION']","['competitive advantage', 'information']","['allocation', 'competitive advantage', 'market failures', 'feedback learning', 'real options']",0.2,0.5
"We develop the concept of corporate governance deviance and seek to understand why, when, and how a firm adopts governance practices that do not conform to the dominant governance logic. Drawing on institutional theory, coupled with both the entrepreneurship and corporate governance literature, we advance a middle-range theory of the antecedents of corporate governance deviance that considers both the institutional context and firm-level agency. Specifically, we highlight the centrality of a firm's entrepreneurial identity as it interacts with the national governance logic to jointly create corporate governance discretion (i.e., the latitude of accessible governance practices) within the firm. We argue that as a firm's governance discretion increases, it will be more likely to adopt overconforming or underconforming governance practices that deviate from established norms and practices. Moreover, we propose that adopting a deviant corporate governance practice is contingent on the governance regulatory environment and a firm's corporate governance capacity. We conclude by advancing a new typology of corporate governance deviance based on a firm's over-or underconformity with the dominant national logic, as well as its entrepreneurial identity motives. This globally relevant study refines and extends comparative corporate governance research and enriches our current understanding of the institutional logics perspective.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY', 'INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEXITY', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'MANAGEMENT', 'FIRMS', 'POWER', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'COMPENSATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CAPITALISM']",['entrepreneurship'],"['corporate governance', 'logics perspective']",0.0,0.0
"Effective consumer participation (CP) may greatly determine the success of an online community of consumption (OCC). Drawing on theories of organizational citizenship behavior, this paper offers a conceptualization of CP and classifies participation into in-role and extra-role types. An integrated framework based on the concept of customer participation and online community management is proposed and tested with a survey of 469 respondents to explore the antecedents of CP in OCCs. The results show that the effectiveness of online community management, cooperative norms, technology readiness, and perceived benefits of participation all significantly affect in-role and extra-role CP. The findings also reveal that in-role participation is primarily determined by the effectiveness of online community management, whereas extra-role participation is mainly affected by perceived benefits of participation. In addition, effectiveness of online community management positively influences cooperative norms and perceived benefits of participation. This study sheds some new light on the characteristics of CP in OCCs by demonstrating that the OCC users differentiate their in-role participation from extra-role participation. The findings pertaining to the drivers of CP also offer guidelines for managing the two types of participative behavior, which are both vital for the sustainability and success of OCCs.","['Consumer participation', 'co-production', 'customer citizenship behavior', 'online communities of consumption', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION', 'IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT', 'TECHNOLOGY READINESS', 'SERVICE PRODUCTION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'QUALITY', 'NORMS', 'MODEL', 'PERCEPTIONS']","['consumer participation', 'organizational citizenship behavior', 'customer participation', 'technology readiness', 'norms']","['consumer participation', 'online community', 'consumption', 'citizenship', 'online community management', 'technology']",0.16666666666666666,0.2

"The recent surge in the importance of shopper marketing has led to an increased need to understand the drivers of unplanned purchases. The authors address this issue by examining how elements of the current shopping trip (e.g., lagged unplanned purchase, cumulative purchases) and previous shopping trips (e.g., average historical price paid by the shopper) determine unplanned versus planned purchases on the current trip. Using a grocery field study and frequent-shopper-program data, the authors estimate competing models to test behavioral hypotheses using a hierarchical Bayesian probit model with state dependence and serially correlated errors. The results indicate that shoppers with smaller trip budgets tend to exhibit behavior consistent with a self-regulation model (i.e., an unplanned purchase decreases the probability of a subsequent unplanned vs. planned purchase), but this effect reverses later in the trip. In contrast, shoppers with medium-sized trip budgets tend to exhibit behavior consistent with a cuing theory model (i.e., an unplanned purchase increases the probability of a subsequent unplanned vs. planned purchase), and this effect increases as the trip continues. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for research and practice.","['shopper marketing', 'in-store decision making', 'self-regulation', 'cuing theory', 'autocorrelated probit models', 'CONSUMER CHOICE', 'STATE DEPENDENCE', 'SELF-REGULATION', 'MODELS', 'GOALS', 'HETEROGENEITY', 'PROMOTIONS', 'RESOURCES', 'INTERPLAY', 'DEPLETION']","['shopper marketing', 'self regulation', 'cuing theory', 'state dependence', 'self regulation', 'models']","['shopper marketing', 'unplanned purchases']",0.5,0.16666666666666666

"Marketing practitioners are under increasing pressure to demonstrate their contribution to firm performance. It has been widely argued that an inability to account for marketing's contribution has undermined its standing within the firm. To respond to this pressure, marketers are investing in the development of performance measurement abilities, but to date, there have been no empirical studies of whether the ability to measure marketing performance has any actual effect on either firm performance or marketing's stature. In this study of senior marketing managers in high-technology firms, the authors examine the effect of ability to measure marketing performance on firm performance, using both primary data collected from senior marketers and secondary data on firm profitability and stock returns. They also explore the effect of ability to measure marketing on marketing's stature within the firm, which is operationalized as chief executive officer satisfaction with marketing.

"This research examines customer engagement in social media (CESM) using a meta-analytic model of 814 effect sizes across 97 studies involving 161,059 respondents. Findings reveal that customer engagement is driven by satisfaction, positive emotions, and trust, but not by commitment. Satisfaction is a stronger predictor of customer engagement in high (vs. low) convenience, B2B (vs. B2C), and Twitter (vs. Facebook and Blogs). Twitter appears twice as likely as other social media platforms to improve customer engagement via satisfaction and positive emotions. Customer engagement is also found to have substantial value for companies, directly impacting firm performance, behavioral intention, and word-of-mouth. Moreover, hedonic consumption yields nearly three times stronger customer engagement to firm performance effects vis-a-vis utilitarian consumption. However, contrary to conventional managerial wisdom, word-of-mouth does not improve firm performance nor does it mediate customer engagement effects on firm performance.

"Research Summary This study reexamines the relation between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and financial performance by benchmarking firms against industry peers in a given year to identify best-in-class and worst-in-class firms. We also address distributional issues when using CSR ratings (clustering of CSR scores around the median and material differences across industries and time) and financial performance ratios (the possible influence of extreme values). We find that the best-in-class firms outperform their industry peers in terms of operating performance and have higher relative market valuations (Tobin's Q). When we control for endogeneity, we find that the significant relation between operating performance and CSR categories disappears, calling into question whether this relation is causal. However, we continue to find that best-in-class firms receive higher relative market valuations than industry peers. Managerial Summary The conflicting evidence on the relation between CSR and firm performance may influence a manager's decision to invest in CSR activities and an investor's decision to invest in a firm. Our research provides managers and investors with important implications regarding the value of relative benchmarking. Managers should understand that expectations of CSR performance evolve over time and that investors place higher valuations on the best-in-class CSR firms within an industry.","['CSR', 'firm performance', 'firm value', 'MSCI KLD', 'operating income', 'ACTUALLY VALUE SUSTAINABILITY', 'OPERATING PERFORMANCE', 'FIRM', 'IMPACT', 'RISK', 'REPLICATION']","['csr', 'firm performance', 'operating performance', 'firm']","['corporate social responsibility csr', 'financial performance', 'in', 'financial performance', 'operating performance', 'relative market valuations']",0.16666666666666666,0.25
"Given the importance of location choice for accessing knowledge, we examine the location choices of domestic and foreign firms in an emerging economy after market liberalization. In the literature, co-locating with other firms has been associated with agglomerative economies and knowledge spillovers that lower the liability of foreignness for foreign firms. However, as domestic firms are trying to upgrade their capabilities, or catch up, they may also prefer locations with other firms, as these locations have knowledge spillover potential. We develop competing hypotheses to test the extent to which catch-up motivations affect location decisions. Examining the location choices of 501 domestic and 68 foreign firms for their R&D laboratories in India during 2005-2010, we find that domestic firms exhibit a stronger preference for cities with high agglomeration than foreign firms do. This shows that upgrading motivations dominate location choice during periods of accelerated catch-up in emerging economies.","['agglomeration', 'catch-up', 'upgrading', 'economic geography', 'liability of foreignness', 'firm entry', 'DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'UNITED-STATES', 'MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISES', 'LOCATION DECISIONS', 'INCREASING RETURNS', 'PROBIT MODELS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'FIRMS', 'SPILLOVERS', 'INNOVATION']","['agglomeration', 'catch up', 'upgrading', 'liability of foreignness', 'location decisions', 'knowledge', 'firms', 'spillovers']","['location choice', 'firms', 'knowledge spillovers', 'catch up motivations']",0.25,0.125
"The authors show how new realities in the private-label (PL) landscape, including differential PL-sourcing relationships and differentiated, three-tiered PL portfolios, affect the gross margins that retailers realize on their PLs. In addition, they examine the moderating role of the identity of the PL supplier (dual brander vs. dedicated supplier). Retailer PL margins are lower for stockkeeping units from PL suppliers with whom the retailer shares a more intense relationship, as reflected in their relationship breadth and depth, but this negative effect can be countered through multisourcing. Building prolonged relationships with PL suppliers also results in lower retailer PL margins, but only for more national brand-oriented suppliers. Dedicated PL suppliers have little to gain by building long-term retailer relationships, but they are less vulnerable to the retailer's practice of multisourcing than dual branders. Although economy PLs may appeal to conventional supermarkets to keep (hard) discounters at bay, they result in lower margins (percentage-wise and absolute) than the standard PLs they cannibalize. Premium PLs, in turn, offer the retailer a higher margin, but only when produced by suppliers with a sufficient extent of national brand focus. However, the higher promotional support often given to premium PLs tends to mitigate the actual margin advantage.","['retailing', 'private labels', 'margins', 'sourcing', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'BRAND', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'CATEGORY', 'GOVERNANCE', 'MECHANISMS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'PREMIUM']","['margins', 'sourcing', 'brand', 'premium']",['retailer relationships'],0.0,0.0
"The authors assess how and why retailer-customized coupon campaigns affect customer purchases. The conceptual model proposes effects on trip incidence and revenues through the mere exposure to campaigns (exposure effect) and the redemption of coupons (redemption effect). The authors propose monetary savings of the coupons, regularity of the campaigns, and coupon fit with customer preferences as moderators. Analysis of data from a group of regional grocery chains that were part of a quasi experiment demonstrates that retailer-customized coupon campaigns have a positive exposure and redemption effect on customer purchases. Mere exposure to customized coupon campaigns contributes more than coupon redemption to campaign returns. Consistent with theoretical expectations, customized coupon campaigns are more effective if they provide more discounts, are unexpected, and are positioned as specially selected for and customized to consumer preferences. The substantial exposure effects suggest that managers should look beyond redemption rates and also consider sales lift from nonredeemers when measuring the effectiveness of customized coupon campaigns.","['customer relationship management', 'retailer customer contribution', 'sales promotions', 'metrics', 'customized coupons', 'retailer coupons', 'advertising exposure', 'CONSUMER RESPONSE', 'PROMOTION', 'PURCHASE', 'LOYALTY', 'PROFITABILITY', 'CUSTOMERS', 'FRAMEWORK', 'CATEGORY', 'PROGRAMS', 'BEHAVIOR']",['purchase'],['exposure to'],0.0,0.0
"Introducing a process model of power and institutional change, I argue that actors may seek power by creating, supporting, or modifying institutions. Lacking unilateral authority to enact new institutions, actors can leverage symbolic resources into coercive resources, which may require making concessions to multiple logics and stakeholders. The emergent organizations and institutions are then subject to adjustment to stakeholder and regulator expectations. The argument is illustrated in a case study of the 1968 Third World Strike at San Francisco State College, where the college president strove to increase his authority so he could prevail in a dispute with student activists.","['nan', 'SOCIOLOGICAL APPROACH', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'SUGGESTIONS', 'STRATEGIES', 'INDUSTRY', 'LOGICS', 'MODEL', 'RISE', 'MYTH']","['organizations', 'logics', 'model']",[],0,0.0
"Many employees in today's organizations are involved in more than one team at the same time. Building on the challenge-hindrance stressor framework, this study investigates potential benefits and disadvantages of such multiple team membership (MTM) for individual employees. Furthermore, we extend this framework with insights from the job demands-resources model to propose that, depending on an employee's organizational tenure, individual MTM will differentially shape his or her perceptions of work challenge and role ambiguity, subsequently influencing the employee's job performance and absenteeism. We tested our conceptual model using time-lagged multi-source data from a large organization of applied research (N = 1211). Our results demonstrate that, for employees with relatively low organizational tenure, MTM was negatively associated with perceived work challenge and positively associated with perceived role ambiguity, which in turn associated with lower job performance and higher absenteeism. For employees with higher organizational tenure, by contrast, MTM associated positively with their work challenge perceptions and subsequent performance outcomes, whereas MTM was unrelated to perceived role ambiguity as well as absenteeism. These findings identify relevant psychological mechanisms and a key contingency factor that explain when and why MTM may have positive or negative individual-level consequences.","['absenteeism', 'job performance', 'multiple team membership', 'organizational tenure', 'role ambiguity', 'work challenge', 'ROLE AMBIGUITY', 'ROLE-CONFLICT', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'SICK LEAVE', 'WORK', 'MODEL', 'SOCIALIZATION', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'MOTIVATION', 'EXPERIENCE']","['absenteeism', 'job performance', 'multiple team membership', 'organizational tenure', 'role ambiguity', 'work challenge', 'role ambiguity', 'job performance', 'work', 'model']","['job demands resources', 'organizational tenure', 'role', 'job performance', 'work challenge', 'role']",0.5,0.3
"While previous work has focused on the positive impact of smiles on interpersonal perceptions, this research proposes and finds that smile intensity differentially affects two fundamental dimensions of social judgments-warmth and competence. A marketer displaying a broad smile, compared to a slight smile, is more likely to be perceived by consumers as warmer but less competent. Furthermore, the facilitative effect of smile intensity on warmth perceptions is more prominent among promotion-focused consumers and in low-risk consumption contexts, while the detrimental effect of smile intensity on competence perceptions is more likely to occur among prevention-focused consumers and in high-risk consumption situations. Field observations in a crowdfunding context further indicate that the effects of smile intensity on warmth and competence perceptions have downstream consequences on actual consumer behaviors.","['smile intensity', 'warmth perceptions', 'competence perceptions', 'face-based inferences', 'social cognition', 'EMOTIONAL CONTAGION', 'FACIAL EXPRESSION', 'REGULATORY FOCUS', 'PERCEIVED RISK', 'JUDGMENTS', 'SERVICE', 'MODEL', 'PERSONALITY', 'SELF', 'MOOD']","['smile intensity', 'warmth perceptions', 'competence perceptions', 'judgments']","['promotion', 'prevention', 'behaviors']",0.0,0.0

Using panel data of 94 family businesses operating in four high-tech industries over 12 years, we find that higher strategic consistencycontinuity with past exploration and exploitation strategies stemming from managerial intentionalityyields higher levels of performance. This relationship is also moderated by environmental dynamism, munificence, and organizational size, which demonstrates the contingent and complex nature of the main relationship. Furthermore, in contrast to 113 nonfamily businesses, we find that the main relationship is stronger for family businesses.","['strategic consistency', 'exploration and exploitation', 'performance', 'ORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'DOMINANT LOGIC', 'AGENCY THEORY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'ENVIRONMENT']","['strategic consistency', 'exploration and exploitation', 'performance', 'environment']","['family business', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'performance']",0.25,0.25
"We investigate the association between service intensity and the survival odds of new manufacturing ventures. Although previous research extensively addresses the value of servitization in established firms, this is the first empirical study that asks whether service intensity, defined as the percentage of sales from services, is beneficial or detrimental to new ventures. Drawing on resource-advantage theory, we further ask whether, under increasing service intensity, new ventures with a higher industry-adjusted ratio of tangible to total assets, labor productivity, or current ratio improve survival odds. Based on a comprehensive data on 6,683 new Portuguese manufacturing ventures founded between 2006 and 2010 and followed until 2015 (33,272 venture-year observations), the results show that higher service intensity lowers the odds of survival. For entrepreneurs, we caution against higher service intensity but demonstrate that survival odds can improve under increasing service intensity when the company can achieve a higher industry median-adjusted ratio of tangible to total assets, improved labor productivity, or a stronger current ratio position. The findings are robust after controlling for endogeneity and self-selection into services.","['service intensity', 'new ventures', 'survival', 'liability of newness', 'resource-advantage theory', 'BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT', 'PRODUCT INNOVATION', 'FIRMS', 'SERVITIZATION', 'GROWTH', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGIES', 'IMPACT', 'MODEL', 'CAPABILITIES']","['service intensity', 'new ventures', 'survival', 'resource advantage theory', 'firms', 'servitization']","['service intensity', 'survival odds', 'new manufacturing ventures', 'servitization', 'resource advantage theory', 'productivity', 'self selection']",0.42857142857142855,0.5
"We use the Power-Responsibility Equilibrium (PRE) framework and advance that consumers balance perceived deficits in privacy protection by power holders (businesses and regulators) with defensive actions. In our model, consumer privacy concern is the endogenous mediating entity linking business policy and regulatory perceptions to negative online user responses. The model was empirically tested and confirmed in an experimental setting. In a second study, we added the nature of consumer information involved into a sub-model. Here, we investigated the moderating role of information sensitivity and congruency on the business policy-concern relationship across three industry contexts. Both hypothesized two-way interactions were confirmed, suggesting that a strong business policy is effective in reducing concern when low sensitivity data are gathered, but insufficient in reducing concern for highly sensitive data. Furthermore, concern increased dramatically when sensitive data were collected that were incongruent with the business context.","['Online privacy', 'power responsibility', 'business policy', 'regulation', 'congruency-sensitivity interaction', 'INFORMATION PRIVACY', 'LEGAL', 'DIMENSIONS']","['power responsibility', 'business policy']",['information'],0.0,0.0

"Research Summary: The ability of innovative firms to create and capture value depends on innovations that are quickly and widely adopted. Yet, stakeholder concerns can establish important barriers to diffusion. We study the human capital aspect of this challenge and investigate whether innovative firms pay salary premiums to new hires with work experience from advocacy groups like Transparency International. We integrate strategic human capital with stakeholder theory and suggest that advocacy group experience creates signals for valuable human capital in terms of stakeholder knowledge and legitimacy transfers to innovative firms. Using matched data for 3,562 employees in Denmark, we find that new hires with advocacy group experience enjoy larger salary premiums at technologically leading firms, in occupations with direct stakeholder interaction, and for advocacy group top management. Managerial Summary: Innovation research is increasingly aware of the non-technological factors behind successful innovations. Users, regulators, or public opinion can be benevolent supporters or stingy opponents of innovations. Employees with an understanding of the needs and sensitivities of societal stakeholders should therefore be valuable to innovative firms. We find this to be the case when innovative firms hire employees from advocacy groups representing such stakeholders (e.g., Transparency International). Such employees receive higher salaries than an otherwise comparable reference group. These findings indicate that recruiting needs of innovative firms reward stakeholder experience, not merely technological expertise. They demonstrate how firms can create value in the pursuit of the public interest. Further, advocacy groups emerge as an important career stage allowing individuals to develop credible signals for stakeholder expertise.","['advocacy groups', 'human capital', 'signaling', 'stakeholder theory', 'value creation', 'STAKEHOLDER', 'MOBILITY', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'LEGITIMACY', 'INVESTMENT', 'DIFFUSION', 'FRAMEWORK', 'EARNINGS', 'SEARCH', 'POLICY']","['advocacy groups', 'human capital', 'stakeholder theory', 'stakeholder', 'legitimacy', 'diffusion', 'search']","['innovations', 'work experience', 'advocacy', 'transparency international', 'stakeholder theory', 'knowledge', 'top management']",0.14285714285714285,0.14285714285714285

"The accelerating pace of global capital market integration has provided new opportunities for firms to raise capital abroad through global debt issues, cross-listings, and initial public offerings in foreign stock exchanges. However, existing empirical evidence suggests that foreign firms tend to be at a disadvantage compared with domestic firms, and they often suffer from investors' home bias. The objective of this paper is to understand why firms are facing problems when accessing capital in foreign markets, and possible mechanisms that can help to mitigate these problems. It expands the liability of foreignness (LOF) research beyond the product market domain to include liabilities faced by firms attempting to secure resources in foreign capital markets. We identify key differences between product and capital markets related to information environment, time structure of transactions, and linkages between buyers and sellers. We analyze institutional distance, information asymmetry, unfamiliarity, and cultural differences as the main sources of capital market LOF (CMLOF). We suggest possible mechanisms that managers can employ to mitigate CMLOF and overcome investors' home bias: bonding, signaling, organizational isomorphism, and reputational endorsements. We also outline directions for further theoretical and empirical development of the CMLOF research.

"Although prior research underscores the benefits of external collaboration for a firm's innovative output, little research has examined the role that collaboration plays across the different stages of the innovation process. Drawing from organizational learning theory, this article examines (1) how collaboration with domestic partners assists in the formation of collaborations with foreign partners, (2) how knowledge from these collaborations is associated with product innovation at different levels of novelty, and (3) how the relationship between the level of innovation novelty and firm growth is influenced by whether the focal firm engages in open or closed innovation and the origin of the collaborator (foreign or domestic). Three key findings emerge from the econometric analysis of a sample of 1684 Taiwanese firms. First, domestic collaborations assist in the formation of foreign collaborations when the partner type is the same. Second, the level of innovation novelty is associated with the type and geographic location of partners. This study differentiates among noninnovating firms, incremental innovators, and radical innovators and demonstrates that the role of partners changes as the number of countries in which a firm collaborates with each partner type increases. Third, only radical innovation is relevant to firm growth, regardless of whether it is developed internally or through collaboration with domestic or foreign partners.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'MANUFACTURING FIRMS', 'VALUE CHAIN', 'DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION', 'RADICAL INNOVATION', 'PANEL-DATA', 'SUPPLIER INVOLVEMENT', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'BUSINESS SERVICES']",['radical innovation'],['radical innovation'],1.0,1.0
"The general aim of the paper is to shift interest in group communication in organizations in general and in committees in particular away from a prescriptive and rationalistic view detached from the organizational context towards a more analytical approach which takes account of important organizational issues of conflict, power and accountability. The paper outlines a theoretical model containing 11 propositions. The model contains definitions of rhetorical power (defined to be distinct from positional power), rhetorical accountability (defined to be different from organizational accountability for a task) and rhetorical conflict and contains 12 rhetorical variables which are language categories, and eight non-rhetorical variables. These language categories are argumentation elements which can be identified within any committee transcript such as proposals, challenges and questions and which have been derived from previously published and validated coding schemes. The model predicts that committee members will seek to maximize their rhetorical power by using some language categories and avoiding others, and that they will seek to vary the amount of rhetorical accountability they wish to claim depending on the likely success or failure of the project being discussed. The model also predicts that the proportions of language categories within any committee transcript will change depending upon how open or hostile the committee debate is, and that the proportions of language categories will also be changed by attempts by committee leaders to reduce rhetorical conflict by using some language categories and avoiding others. Several relations between rhetorical power and rhetorical conflict are hypothesized. According to the model, rhetorical power and rhetorical conflict can be manipulated by participants in beneficial ways only under some circumstances (those which characterize an open rather than a hostile committee debate). The model is related to several important non-rhetorical variables.","['nan', 'GROUP DECISION-MAKING', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'PERSUASION', 'NEGOTIATIONS', 'ATTRIBUTION', 'DISCOURSE', 'CHOICE', 'IMPACT', 'MODEL']","['organization', 'model']",[],0,0.0
"Over two decades, social influence researchers have called for a study that would examine how, why, and when influence tactics are effective. Informed by balance theory, the present study proposes that subordinate and supervisor political skill impacts the effectiveness of ingratiation attempts. The results from a survey of 228 supervisor-subordinate dyads in Chinese firms indicated that subordinates with high political skill are less likely to have their exhibited ingratiation behaviour perceived by their supervisors; however, supervisors with high political skill are likely to perceive ingratiation behaviour demonstrated by their subordinates. Moreover, the most successful condition for enabling subordinates to hide ingratiation from their supervisors is when the subordinates are politically astute and the supervisors are not. Furthermore, when supervisors perceive ingratiation behaviour, they rate low on the job performance and promotability of their subordinates; these low ratings are explained by the undermined personal reputation of the subordinates due to their ingratiation detected.","['ingratiation', 'performance', 'political skill', 'promotability', 'reputation', 'LEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT', 'CAREER SUCCESS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP', 'INFLUENCE TACTICS', 'IN-ROLE', 'REPUTATION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'OUTCOMES', 'ANTECEDENTS']","['ingratiation', 'performance', 'political skill', 'promotability', 'reputation', 'influence tactics', 'reputation']","['social influence', 'balance', 'political skill', 'firms', 'performance']",0.4,0.2857142857142857
"Previous preannouncement research has primarily focused on product preannouncements regarding the firm's intention to introduce a new product and, for the most part, has ignored preannouncements that update the status of new product introductions (e.g., delays in launch dales and cancellation of new product programs). This study's goal is to examine if different factors influence preannouncements of new product introductions (NPIs) versus new product withdrawals or delays (NPWs). A model of six antecedents that could influence a firm's propensity to issue NPIs and NPWs is developed and tested using a sample of 265 CEOs and Presidents from manufacturers of new products. Three of the antecedents are organizational in nature; specifically, first mover predisposition, firm information interactivity, and reputation building. Also, the effects of two environmental constructs, industry innovativeness and competitive hostility, are examined. Finally, the model incorporates the effect of buyer involvement on a firm's propensity to issue NPIs and NPWs. The results indicate that NPIs and NPWs are very alike regarding their antecedent factors. Reputation building, defined as a firm's tendency to pursue a high profile leadership position within its industry, and buyer involvement are the primary motivators of a firm's propensity to issue both NPWs and NPIs. Future directions for research include the development of a normative preannouncement framework and the examination of NPIs and NPWs as nonadvertising forms of marketing communication targeted at numerous audiences such as buyers, employees, channel members, industry influencers (e.g., business and trade related press), and investors.

"In this study we revisit some fundamental questions that are increasingly at the heart of current strategic management discourse regarding the relative impact of industry and firm-specific factors on sustainable competitive advantage. We explore this issue by referring to respective assertions of two major perspectives that dominate the literature over the last two decades: the Porter framework of competitive strategy and the more recent resource-based view of the firm. A composite model is proposed which elaborates upon both perspectives' divergent causal logic with respect to the conditions relevant for firm success. Empirical findings suggest that industry and firm specific effects are both important but explain different dimensions of performance. Where industry forces influence market performance and profitability, firm assets act upon accomplishments in the market arena (i.e., market performance), and via the latter, to profitability.

However, empirical research on industrial buying behavior in Asia is sparse, and the extant literature indicates that buyer behavior may differ in non-Western industrial marketing relationships.

The results from 340 industrial relationships indicate the significant role of communications and adaptations in relationship development. Moreover, trust in suppliers and their performance are equally important factors in a manufacturer's business share allocation.

"When consumers try to assess the performance of a product on a key benefit, their information search often reveals both diagnostic information and irrelevant information. Although one would expect irrelevant information to have little impact on predictions of product performance, we present evidence that the irrelevant information systematically weakens consumers' beliefs that the product will provide the benefit. We show that this dilution effect persists after subjects have acknowledged the irrelevance of the additional information but that it does depend on whether the product information is processed with the desired benefit in mind. We conclude that consumers are selectively looking for information that suggests the product will deliver the desired benefit and that they categorize any additional evidence, be it irrelevant or disconfirming, as not confirming. As a consequence, irrelevant information weakens consumers' beliefs in the product's ability to deliver the benefit.","['nan', 'NONDIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION', 'MEANINGLESS DIFFERENTIATION', 'BASE RATES', 'HYPOTHESIS', 'DILUTION', 'REPRESENTATIVENESS', 'DIAGNOSTICITY', 'CONVERSATION', 'PROBABILITY', 'STEREOTYPES']",['dilution'],[],0,0.0

Specifically, this research examines how strategic orientation relates to new product ideation outcomes such as ideation volume (i.e., how many new product ideas are generated) and ideation novelty (i.e., how innovative ideas are). The model developed in this study includes both direct effects of strategic orientation on new product ideation and indirect effects on ideation, mediated by an organization's market search behavior targeted at uncovering new product ideas. A survey of 182 marketing and technical managers, whose responses are analyzed with partial least squares (PLS), reveals that firms characterized by a competitor orientation search their markets significantly more for new product ideas than firms marked by a technology or customer orientation. An emphasis on market search behavior, in turn, leads to significantly greater quantities of new product ideas generated by the firm. Neither a competitor nor a customer orientation significantly enhances the novelty of new product ideas, which is augmented only by technology orientation. The data also reveal that product ideation novelty is significantly enhanced by a technology orientation regardless of the level of market turbulence faced by the innovating firm. Together, these findings suggest that market orientation may have a greater influence on the implementation and commercialization stages of new product development than on new product ideation.","['nan', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'FIRM VALUE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'INSIGHTS', 'EXPLORATION', 'CONSTRUCT']","['market orientation', 'performance', 'innovation', 'technology']",['market search'],0.0,0.0
"Small-scale firms in rural areas play an extremely important role in the development of any country, and especially in developing countries. To understand entrepreneurs who operate in a low-technology industry, we rely on the network perspective on entrepreneurship. In this paper, we investigate how the social and human capital of entrepreneurs (in this case master weavers in the handloom industry) influence their ability to recognize opportunities and mobilize resources. In addition to examining the direct effects, we also explore the possibilities of social capital mediating between human capital, on the one hand, and opportunity recognition and resource mobilization on the other. This paper adds to existing literature in two ways: firstly, we expand the social capital paradigm by including different cultural settings and links to existing studies regarding small enterprises. Secondly, we provide additional evidence to the ongoing debate as to what constitutes a 'good network'. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

"Purpose - The purpose of this article is to provide academics and practitioners a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the benefits, barriers, and bridges to successful collaboration in strategic supply chains. Design/methodology/approach - A triangulation method consisting of a literature review, a cross-functional mail survey, and 51 in-depth case analyses was implemented. Senior managers from purchasing, manufacturing, and logistics were targeted in the mail survey. The break down by channel category interviews is as follows: 14 retailers, 13 finished goods assemblers, 12 first-tier suppliers, three lower-tier suppliers, and nine service providers. Findings - Customer satisfaction and service is perceived as more enduring than cost savings. All managers recognize technology, information, and measurement systems as major barriers to successful supply chain collaboration. However, the people issues - such as culture, trust, aversion to change, and willingness to collaborate - are more intractable. People are the key bridge to successful collaborative innovation and should therefore not be overlooked as companies invest in supply chain enablers such as technology, information, and measurement systems. Research limitations/implications - The average mail-survey response rate was relatively low: 23.5 percent. The case study analyses were not consistent in frequency across channel functions. Although the majority of companies interviewed and surveyed were international, all surveys and interviews were managers based in the US. Practical implications - This study provides new insight into understanding the success and hindering factors of supply chain management. The extensive literature review, the cross-channel analysis, and case studies provide academics and managers a macro picture of the goals, challenges, and strategies for implementing supply chain management. Originality/value - This paper uses triangulation methodology for examining key issues of supply chain management at multiple levels within the supply chain.","['supply chain management', 'strategic management', 'relationship marketing', 'COLLABORATION', 'TRIANGULATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INTEGRATION', 'COMPLEXITY', 'CONFLICT', 'GLITCHES', 'TRUST']","['supply chain management', 'collaboration', 'triangulation', 'trust']",['supply chain management'],1.0,0.25
"Evidence from traditional service settings shows that service quality is a major driver of customer satisfaction, trust, and loyalty, which ultimately lead to profitability. Regarding business on the Internet, many argue that trust and loyalty become even more important for long-term success. But does quality play the same influential role in the context of Web-based services, where it is said that price is king and competitors just one click away? In the present study, the authors develop a structural equation model that links Web-based service quality to a broad set of consequences. The model is tested with a large sample drawn from three different Web-based service domains. The results provide insights into the mechanisms leading from Web-based service quality to outcome variables. Specifically, they point to a multifaceted chain of effects, with trust playing a key mediating role.","['nan', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'BEHAVIORAL INTENTIONS', 'REASONED ACTION', 'SELF-SERVICE', 'LOYALTY', 'TRUST', 'ONLINE', 'MODEL', 'INTERNET', 'SCALE']","['customer satisfaction', 'loyalty', 'trust', 'model', 'internet']","['service quality', 'trust', 'loyalty', 'web', 'services']",0.4,0.4
"The authors compare the effectiveness of in-store coupons and straight off-the-shelf price discounts (bonus buys), in generating incremental sales and profits for the retailer. In five field tests, they find that, on average, in-store coupons lead to a 35% greater increase in the promoted brand's sales than bonus buys offering the same level of discount. Because redemption rates average 55%, in-store coupons produce a 108% greater increase in dollar profits than bonus buys. Both promotion vehicles have the same effect on the rest of the category, so coupons lead to higher overall category sales and profits. The authors develop a unified decision framework for a retailer maximizing category profits, that considers the trade-offs involved in using coupons and bonus buys in response to bill-back trade deals. Their empirical application in the ready-to-eat cereal category shows that the retailer passes through larger amounts of a trade deal when using in-store coupons. As a consequence, at the optimal discount level, unit category sales and dollar category profits are substantially higher with coupons. Robustness checks show that the findings hold over a wide range of parameter values and are, thus, generalizable.","['nan', 'COUPON REDEMPTION RATES', 'PROMOTIONS', 'SUBSTITUTION', 'CONSUMER', 'PURCHASE', 'IMPACT', 'BRAND']",['brand'],"['coupons', 'price discounts']",0.0,0.0
"This paper examines how relational capital influences the acquisition of knowledge among alliance partners. We propose that firms with higher levels of inter- and intrafirm learning are better able to achieve superior alliance outcomes. A conceptual framework is developed by integrating the relational view, organizational learning theory, and the resource-based view. We provide empirical evidence using large-sample data to test the model and find that trust and interaction creates a basis for knowledge acquisition across alliance partners. The results also indicate that when the firms are active in knowledge acquisition from alliance partners and dissemination of such knowledge within the organization, they are capable of enhancing satisfaction with the alliance relationship.

"The authors show that the value of a risky option decreases upon addition of risky prospects of the same valence. For instance, a medical drug with a potential side effect of seizures is viewed as less threatening when it also has smaller potential side effects, such as congestion and fatigue; travel insurance covering serious injury is viewed as less attractive when it also covers minor ailments; a lottery offering a chance to win an iPad is viewed as less attractive when it also offers a chance to win smaller prizes. As a result, consumers can perceive normatively more dangerous (beneficial) options to be less dangerous (beneficial) and normatively less dangerous (beneficial) options to be more dangerous (beneficial). This effect arises because people believe that larger prospects (e.g., seizures) are less likely than smaller prospects (e.g., congestion). Therefore, inclusion of smaller prospects by contrast makes a larger prospect appear less likely, which in turn reduces the perceived value of the risky option. Thus, this effect arises only when smaller prospects are added to a larger prospect, and only when the prospects are probabilistic. Cognitive load and feelings of personal control also moderate the effect.","['risk', 'risk perception', 'risky outcomes', 'medical decision making', 'probability inference', 'PREFERENCE REVERSALS', 'PRESENTERS PARADOX', 'CHOICE', 'PERCEPTION', 'AVAILABILITY', 'EVALUABILITY', 'EXPLANATION', 'INFORMATION', 'ILLUSION', 'CONTEXT']",['risk'],"['cognitive load', 'personal control']",0.0,0.0

"P>We analyse the non-market advantages of developing-country multinational companies (DMNCs) over advanced-economy multinational companies (AMNCs) when both compete in the same host country. Non-market advantages are advantages based on resources developed by the firm to operate in a country's environment. Building on the resource-based theory and the concept of distance, we classify dimensions of a country's environment into three types (obligating, pressuring, and supporting) and argue that each type has a different impact on the advantages of DMNCs over AMNCs. First, obligating dimensions are those dimensions in which countries are not more or less developed than others; they are merely different, obligating a firm to develop particular non-market resources to operate there. In such cases, the advantage of DMNCs over AMNCs cannot be differentiated. Instead, MNCs from more distant home countries have a disadvantage compared to MNCs from less distant countries. This is the traditional conceptualization of distance in the literature. Second, pressuring dimensions are those dimensions in which countries are more or less demanding in pressuring the firm to continuously upgrade its non-market resources. For these dimensions, DMNCs face a disadvantage against AMNCs, because the latter have more sophisticated non-market resources than the former. Third, supporting dimensions are those in which countries are more or less developed in their provision of external non-market resources that support the firm's operations. In this case, DMNCs tend to enjoy an advantage over AMNCs, because the former are better at dealing with a lack of supporting resources than the latter. These last two types of dimensions challenge the commonly held ideas that distance is always directionless and always results in a disadvantage.","['nan', 'INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'CULTURAL DISTANCE', 'STRATEGIES', 'GIANTS', 'MARKET', 'MNES', 'ENTERPRISES', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'IMPACT']","['market', 'impact']","['firm', 'resource based theory']",0.0,0.0

The first paper rigorously assesses and enhances the construct validity of EO-an important antecedent to empirical research. The second paper draws on the concepts of identity and social identity and provides a means of predicting how various ownership types of family firms will affect the EO-performance relationship. The third paper synthesizes multiple theoretical perspectives and empirical research to provide insights on the role that EO plays in enhancing a firm's acquisitive and experimental learning.

"We address the lack of knowledge concerning the role of host country languages in multinational corporations based on an inductive qualitative study involving 70 interviews with Nordic expatriates and host country employees (HCE) in China. Building on the strongly discrepant views of expatriates and HCEs, we demonstrate how expatriates' willingness to learn and use the host country language lead to different types of expatriate-HCE relationships, ranging from harmonious to distant or segregated. In doing so, we emphasize the subtle and fragile connection between expatriates' attitude towards HCEs' mother tongue and trust formation in addition to the construction of superiority-inferiority relationships.

"To successfully satisfy large customers and meet financial objectives, dedicated sales teams need to manage two boundaries: a boundary within the selling firm and one with the customer organization. However, little is known about the process of managing these multiple boundaries. This study integrates job demands-resource theory with research on key account management and sales teams to examine (1) the main effect of customer boundary spanning on perceived customer satisfaction and team performance and (2) the moderating role of within-firm coordination activities at three levels: top management, cross-functional, and within-team. An empirical test of the model with data from 167 sales teams finds that the interaction between customer boundary spanning and within-firm coordination activities has opposite effects on perceived customer satisfaction and team performance outcomes. The results are robust to endogeneity and heteroskedasticity concerns.","['Boundary spanning', 'Dedicated sales teams', 'Customer satisfaction', 'Team performance', 'BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS', 'JOB DEMANDS', 'METHOD BIAS', 'SALES', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'ORIENTATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'SERVICE', 'MODEL']","['boundary spanning', 'dedicated sales teams', 'customer satisfaction', 'team performance', 'job demands', 'sales', 'management', 'model']","['boundary spanning', 'customer satisfaction', 'performance', 'firm coordination']",0.5,0.25
"Sensory attributes, such as sound quality ascertained by listening to a stereo, are often ambiguous and therefore difficult to encode and retrieve. Despite this, consumers often place more weight on these attributes compared to verbally described market information when making brand choice decisions. Results from two studies demonstrate that providing criteria to evaluate the sound quality of competing brands of stereos facilitates the encoding, retrieval, and alignment of the sensory attribute in a brand choice task. Study 1 shows that without criteria to evaluate sound quality during trial, memory for this attribute is poor. Further, perceptions of sound quality assimilate to conflicting market information, which adversely affects decision performance. The reverse is true when evaluative criteria and a scheme to rate the criteria are provided: memory for sound quality improves, perceptions of sound quality contrast with conflicting market information, more weight is placed on sound quality when decision making, and better choices are made. Study 2 shows that providing evaluative criteria during product trial enhances performance through improvement in the encoding process.","['nan', 'CONSUMER CHOICE', 'COMMUNICATION', 'INFORMATION', 'SIMILARITY', 'EXPERIENCE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'MODERATOR', 'JUDGMENT', 'TRIAL']","['information', 'trial']","['sound quality', 'memory']",0.0,0.0

"Research summary:Previous research has examined the racial diversity-productivity relationship in corporations with an evident high commitment to minority programs, Fortune's Best Companies for Minorities. To assess generalizability, we replicate this research using a different context of high organizational-employee value congruence, Fortune's Best Companies to Work For. We are not able to find evidence for the curvilinear relationships previously found, but do uncover a linear negative relationship between racial diversity and short-run performance. Managerial summary:Using Fortune's Best Companies for Minorities, previous research found that racial diversity affected both firm productivity and Tobin's q. To see if we could find these results in a different group of firms, we replicate this research using a sample drawn from Fortune's Best Companies to Work For. The former sample is distinguished by high commitment to minority programs, while the one used here stresses high congruence of values between the organization and all its employees. We are unable to replicate the relationships previously found, however, but do find that increasing racial diversity had a negative effect on firm productivity.

"Vulnerability is salient among international managers, who tend to be wary when operating in transition economies like China. Systematic research is lacking, though, on how the local environment influences foreign managers' perception of vulnerability, and how foreign managers can develop trust even when their perceived vulnerability is high. We conducted in-depth case studies of two foreign-controlled enterprises in China, and developed a theoretical model that links perceptions of the macro-level environment to micro-level management. Our results illustrate the antecedents and consequences of perceived vulnerability and the processes of trust building in unfavorable environments. Through comparative analysis of the two cases, we found that the foreign managers' perceived vulnerability was shaped by the institutional, technological, and market conditions of the local environment, and we learned how this perceived vulnerability influenced their trust in the local workforce and the joint investment in formal and social control they used in building trust. The effect of perceived vulnerability on trust was moderated over time when the implementation of control was combined with active investments in trust, which led to behavioral changes on the part of the local employees, which in turn increased their trustworthiness. The implications of these findings are discussed.

"Business-to-Business platforms provide connectivity and data exchange services and compete in several dedicated services, such as electronic invoicing (e-invoicing). Thus far, little research has examined the factors that influence firms' choice among competing platforms: Which platform features matter, and in what proportion in the decision maker's choice? To address this gap, we conduct an empirical study and triangulate with past theoretical explanations that have sought to account for the firm's choice. Based on the analysis, we formulate a platform selection model that includes nine features: (1) reach, (2) total cost, (3) usability, (4) ease of system integration, (5) implementation capability, (6) platform support for service improvement, (7) service customization, (8) platform reputation, and (9) long-term sustainability. We apply conjoint analysis using firms' selection data, collected from 282 firms that have recently made a purchase decision among e-invoicing platforms. All features except the vendor's implementation capability are found to significantly influence the platform choice. Two featuresusability and reachdominate the choice and account for nearly 50 percent of the likely outcome. We use cluster analysis to examine the effect of firm size on firms' preferences in platform features. As hypothesized, larger companies prefer interoperability, scale, and network effects, while smaller companies value local use efficiency and ease of use because they are more concerned with usability and cost. Our theoretical and managerial claims concerning platform choice highlight the difficulty of bootstrapping, the role of pricing and cost, the minor importance of implementation-related features, and the impact of longevity during platform contracting.","['B2B platforms', 'electronic invoicing', 'connectivity platform', 'choice problem', 'platform features', 'conjoint analysis', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS', 'SELECTION CRITERIA', 'CONJOINT-ANALYSIS', 'ELECTRONIC COMMERCE', '2-SIDED MARKETS', 'SUPPLY CHAINS', 'HEALTH-CARE', 'ADOPTION', 'INFORMATION', 'COMPETITION']","['electronic invoicing', 'platform features', 'conjoint analysis', 'conjoint analysis']","['invoicing', 'conjoint analysis']",0.5,0.25
"While online platforms often provide a single composite rating and the ratings of different attributes of a product, they largely ignore the attribute characteristics and customer criticality, which limits managerial action. We propose a multi-facet item response theory (MFIRT) approach to simultaneously examine the effects of product attributes, reviewer criticality, consumption situation, product type, and time in assessing latent customer satisfaction. Analyses of hotel ratings from TripAdvisor and beer ratings from BeerAdvocate suggest that product attributes differ with respect to their discriminating and threshold characteristics and that reviewer segments emphasize different attributes when rating various products over time. The MFIRT approach predicts product performance more accurately than alternative methods and provides novel insights to inform marketing strategies. The MFIRT framework can fundamentally advance how we analyze customer satisfaction and other consumer attitudes and improve marketing research and practice.","['Online product ratings', 'Customer satisfaction', 'Product attributes', 'Multi-facet item response theory approach', 'E-commerce', 'WORD-OF-MOUTH', 'COUPON PRONENESS', 'REVIEWS', 'MODELS', 'DIMENSIONALITY', 'CONSUMERS', 'SCALES', 'IMPACT', 'MARKET', 'SALES']","['customer satisfaction', 'product attributes', 'market']","['characteristics', 'customer criticality', 'item response theory', 'customer satisfaction']",0.25,0.3333333333333333

We adopt in this special issue the combinatory view, in which activities and processes are seen as closely intertwined aspects of the same phenomena. It is this view that we argue offers both strategy practice and strategy process scholars some of the greatest opportunities for joint research going forward.

"Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is a process that originated in Japan for managing product development. In this article, Abbie Griffin presents results of a field-based, scientific study of US firms' efforts to implement QFD methods. Her research goals were to understand the QFD process as it is used and implemented, to begin to estimate US product development improvements attributable to QFD and to identify factors linked to QFD's successful use. Based on a study of 35 projects, she found that QFD demonstrated only relatively minor, short-term, measurable impacts on product development performance. Yet, the process may have the potential to improve the development climate in the long term, possibly leading to future, measurable improvements in development performance. Successful projects differed in several ways from those projects that failed in their implementation efforts. Finally, the results suggest several characteristics of product development processes that improve the way products are developed in US companies, including structuring the decision-making processes across functional groups, building a solidly organized, highly motivated team and moving information efficiently from its origin to the ultimate user.","['nan', 'QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT', 'R-AND-D']",['quality function deployment'],['performance'],0.0,0.0

"Firms are investing an increasing amount of time and resources to gather information about market and technology in new product development (NPD). Yet there is a lack of consistent understanding of whether such costly information generation activities can improve product outcomes. More importantly, it is unclear how the benefit of market information and technical information generation may differ and how they may jointly impact new product performance. This study examines the role of market and technical information generation in NPD in three ways: (1) It contrasts the effects of market and technical information generation on product outcomes; (2) it identifies conditions that moderate the effects of market and technical information generation and further investigates how the moderating effects differ for these two types of activities; and (3) it examines the joint effect of market and technical information generation to understand potential synergies between them. Using survey data at the NPD project level, we find that market information generation has an inverted U-shaped effect on new product advantage, whereas the effect of technical information generation follows a U-shape. Furthermore, these effects are moderated differently by two conditions: a firm's R&D intensity that influences NPD projects' need for different types of information, and the use of multidisciplinary teams that affects the degree to which information can be shared and utilized to improve product design. The findings provide important implications for organizational learning and shed light on how to manage information generation activities to achieve NPD success.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'STRATEGIC ORIENTATION', 'RESEARCH PROPOSITIONS', 'CYCLE TIME', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'IMPACT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'INNOVATION', 'ANTECEDENTS']","['impact', 'performance', 'technology']",[],0,0.0
"Purpose - The purpose of this research is to analyse the upstream information distortion among the various members of the agro-food supply chain, regarding the consumers' quality perceptions.

The study involved different actors in the chain: consumers (402), retailers (98), agro-industrials (40) and cattle farmers (84). Findings - The results demonstrated that the more the upstream agents move away from consumers, the more the information becomes distorted. The research also highlighted that the greater the number of links in the chain, the more the consumer's upstream information tends to be distorted.

"Considerable progress has been made in identifying market-driven businesses, understanding what they do, and measuring the bottom-line consequences of their orientation to their markets. The next challenge is to understand how this organizational orientation can be achieved and sustained. The emerging capabilities approach to strategic management, when coupled with total quality management, offers a rich array of ways to design change programs that will enhance a market orientation. The most distinctive features of market-driven organizations are their mastery of the market sensing and customer linking capabilities. A comprehensive change program aimed at enhancing these capabilities includes: (1) the diagnosis of current capabilities, (2) anticipation of future needs for capabilities, (3) bottom-up redesign of underlying processes, (4) top-down direction and commitment, (5) creative use of information technology, and (6) continuous monitoring of progress.","['nan', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'ORIENTATION', 'CULTURE', 'FIRM', 'QUALITY', 'AGENDA']","['strategic management', 'orientation', 'quality']",['total quality management'],0.0,0.0
"This study examines the most valuable sources of new product ideas and the criteria used to screen potential new products in entrepreneurial, high-tech firms. Teresa Pavia explored the practices of 118 small, young, high-tech firms. Her findings complement a variety of existing studies of the new product process in large firms and the few existing studies of the process in entrepreneurial, high-tech firms. The firms participating in this study rely on informal techniques to generate new product ideas. They place heavy reliance on input from their customers and often develop new products in response to problems articulated by these customers. Although the annual strategic plan is not used by most firms as a new product identification tool, it is highly rated by the most successful firms. Successful firms also actively engage in environmental scanning. The majority of the respondents do not use financial measures as a screening criterion, preferring to evaluate new products by gut feel. However, the firms that have experienced the fastest growth in sales employ financial hurdles for project selection. The educational background of the key GO/NO GO decision-makers was also evaluated. Two thirds of the firms reported having a key decision-maker with an educational background in business. The educational background of the key decision-makers had little impact on the aspects of the new product process studied here.","['nan', 'HIGH-TECHNOLOGY FIRMS', 'INDUSTRIAL', 'SUCCESS', 'INNOVATION', 'FAILURE', 'IMPACT', 'MODEL']","['success', 'impact']",[],0,0.0
"Category captainship (CC) is a retailing practice wherein a retailer collaborates with one of the manufacturers in a product category (referred to as the captain) to develop and implement a category management strategy. Although CC has been studied using both theoretical models and surveys, empirical evidence on the benefits and drawbacks of CC is scarce. The authors use a unique data set collected during a CC implementation to empirically examine the impact of CC on the retailer, the captain, and the other manufacturers in the category. The authors find that both the retailer's private label and the captain benefit from CC because of pricing and assortment changes. They also find that some competing manufacturers benefit from CC while others suffer. Specifically, the manufacturers that closely compete with the captain benefit, whereas the manufacturers that are in close competition with the private label suffer because the retailer protects its private label. The authors show that category sales would have been higher if the retailer had not protected its private label. This study sheds light on how joint consideration of assortment and pricing, the presence of a private label, and product characteristics may influence the outcomes of CC implementations.","['category management', 'category captainship', 'private label', 'retailing', 'channel partnerships', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ASSORTMENT', 'BRAND', 'IMPACT', 'BENEFITS', 'CHOICE']","['category management', 'category captainship', 'private label', 'retailing', 'management', 'assortment', 'impact', 'benefits']","['category captainship', 'retailing']",1.0,0.25
"We conducted a metal-analysis of correlations between role ambiguity and job performance and role conflict and job performance. Previous meta-analyses of these role constructs and performance relationships (e.g., Jackson & Schuler; 1985) were limited by small sample sizes and sparse reporting of reliability estimates in primary studies. The present study used a comprehensive database with a larger sample size and a distribution of interrater reliabilities to extend the previous findings. We also tested moderator hypotheses proposed but not conducted by Jackson ann Schuler: Results revealed a negative relationship (rho = -.21) between role ambiguity and job performance with moderating influences due to job type and rating source. A negligible relationship (rho = -.07) was observed for role conflict and job performance, a finding consistent across job types and rating sources. Conclusions were that role ambiguity ought not to Dr dismissed as an unimportant variable ill the job performance domain. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

"Research Summary: We argue that because charisma and narcissism represent widely held prototypes of effective and ineffective forms of leadership, respectively, the likelihood that a focal firm will imitate the practices of its peer firms is affected by these peer firms' CEO characteristics. We theorize that peer firm CEO charisma enhances the focal firm's imitation of peer firms' behaviors, while peer firm CEO narcissism diminishes it. We further posit that the uncertainty of the context affects these imitation processes: industry dynamism and prior experience in a given strategic domain, respectively, strengthens and dampens focal firms' susceptibility to these peer CEOs' attributes. We test and find support for these ideas using a longitudinal sample of Fortune 500 firms in two distinct domains, corporate strategy and corporate social responsibility. Managerial Summary: When companies are uncertain about the costs and benefits of strategic actions this may lead them to imitate the actions of peer companies. But given the uncertainty, the challenge for executives is: which companies to emulate and which to ignore? In a sample of Fortune 500 companies, we find that the charisma or narcissism of a peer company's CEO positively or negatively influences, respectively, the degree to which the peer company's strategic actions are imitated. We reason that this is because these particular CEO attributes are widely believed to drive leadership effectiveness or ineffectiveness, respectively. We also find that the effects of these CEO characteristics on imitation are stronger in dynamic industry environments and weaker for companies that already have experience with the given strategy.","['interorganizational imitation', 'practice diffusion', 'upper echelons', 'CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP', 'INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION', 'IMPLICIT LEADERSHIP', 'NETWORK TIES', 'ENVIRONMENTAL UNCERTAINTY', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'CONSTRUCT-VALIDITY', 'LONGITUDINAL DATA', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE']",['corporate social responsibility'],"['charisma', 'leadership', 'firms', 'ceo characteristics', 'uncertainty', 'peer ceos', 'corporate strategy', 'corporate social responsibility']",0.125,1.0
"In this study, we seek to understand how actors' interpretations of contentious issues evolve over time within organizational fields and how these interpretations may lead to field settlement. Empirically, we examine how groups of actors in the field of civil aviation interpreted the environmental issues of noise and emissions during the period 1996-2010. Actors employed various cultural frames to interpret these issues as they rose and fell in prominence within the field. We develop a framework to track actors' framing trajectories over time; in particular, the extent to which these frames reveal actors' stance toward buffering versus integrating issues into their core operations. We reveal four prototypical framing trajectories and find that actors' framing trajectories were influenced by the extent to which these actors were directly linked to issues in societal discourse and had direct contact with concerned audiences. Based on our analysis, we build theory of how actor framing of issues evolves over time and leads to field settlement of contentious issues.","['nan', 'CLIMATE-CHANGE', 'INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE', 'SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS', 'STRATEGIC ACTION', 'DIFFUSION', 'AVIATION', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'RESPONSES', 'INDUSTRY', 'DYNAMICS']",['aviation'],[],0,0.0
"Although cross-functional integration is often considered an important element in a successful new product development program, a great deal of variance exists in extant literature regarding how integration is defined and implemented and how relevant studies are conducted. The authors attempt to bring clarity to a diverse set of 25 studies that investigate cross-functional integration by empirically analyzing 146 correlations between integration and aspects of new product success. The authors examine the impact of 12 potential moderators that affect the integration-success link using meta-analysis techniques. The findings indicate that though cross-functional integration may indeed have a direct impact on success, the combination of integration with other variables may be of greater importance. Furthermore, because most of the nine variables that significantly affect the integration-success relationship are either managerially controlled or industry specific, the findings imply that firms should design cross-functional structures to maximize their effectiveness. Other variables that affect the integration-success relationship reflect researchers' methodological decisions, suggesting that care should be taken when designing and interpreting the results of such studies. The authors discuss the implications of these findings and directions for further research.","['cross-functional integration', 'new product success', 'new product development', 'meta-analysis', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'IMPACT', 'INFORMATION', 'COMMUNICATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'METAANALYSIS']","['cross functional integration', 'new product success', 'new product development', 'meta analysis', 'impact']","['cross functional integration', 'new product development', 'meta analysis']",1.0,0.6
"Notwithstanding the alleged risks of outsourcing design work, leading manufacturers in the Japanese automotive industry collaborate closely with their key suppliers. Despite widespread recognition of the effectiveness of these close-knit supplier networks, however, little research exists on the factors that affect the purchase of design work from suppliers. S. Nazli Wasti and Jeffrey K. Liker fill this gap by exploring the factors that affect Japanese automotive firms' purchase of design work from their component suppliers. Using data from a survey of 122 Japanese automotive component suppliers, their study addresses two key questions. First, what factors lead Japanese buyers to involve some suppliers heavily in design while giving others relatively little control over design decisions' And second, does the Japanese practice of involving suppliers in design offer performance benefits.' The study focuses on first-tier suppliers of parts, assemblies, and complete subsystems (e.g., audio, fuel and emissions, heating and air conditioning). The study does not include suppliers of raw materials and chemicals, assembly and processing equipment indirect materials, tooling and dies, computers and software, or engineering and business consulting services. The study breaks down the broad concept of supplier involvement in design work into three measurable elements: the extent to which the supplier influences decision-making during the early stages of product development,. the amount of control the buyer retains over the design; and the frequency of design-related communication between the buyer and the supplier Factors that have a positive effect on the level of supplier involvement among the companies studied include technological uncertainty of the component and the supplier's in-house technical capabilities. For companies in the study, the level of competition in the supplier market has a negative effect OR the degree of supplier involvement in design. The responses indicate that supplier involvement offers performance benefits for both the supplier and the buyer. For the supplier firms studied increased involvement in the design process permits greater focus on design for manufacturability (DFM). And of course, supplier-generated design improvements clearly benefit the buyers, allowing these firms to capitalize on the experience and the insight that their suppliers have regarding the parts that they supply.","['nan', 'UNITED-STATES', 'VERTICAL INTEGRATION', 'ORGANIZATION', 'INDUSTRY', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'HIERARCHIES', 'MARKETS', 'EDGE']","['industry', 'performance']",[],0,0.0
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how contractor firms manage their relationships with extended supply chain tiers and investigate the range of ICT technologies used to facilitate such practices. Design/methodology/approach - An on-line questionnaire survey was conducted to gather information about supply chain management operations, supplier relationship management and the ICT technologies used by contractor firms to manage their extended supply chain tiers. Findings - The extended supply chain relationships of contractor firms are primarily composed of contractual, technical and financial entities, but findings suggest that the vision to consider extended supply chain firms when selecting suppliers are still myopic. Majority of ICT technologies are used between Tier 1 supply chain firms and there is an inconsistency in the number of technologies adopted with the extended supply chain tiers. Despite having a high involvement relationship with Tier 2 downstream firms, findings indicate a lack of use of ICI technologies to manage the organisational, personal and technological interactions with these firms. Research limitations/implications - On the basis of different relationship types this study develops an initial framework for management of supply chains that are facilitated by relevant ICT technologies. Originality/value - This paper provides insights into the management of extended supply chain firms by contractor firms from a relationship-centric perspective and develops an initial framework for relationship-centric supply chain management.","['Construction', 'ICT', 'Supply chain management', 'Relationships', 'Contractors', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'MANAGEMENT']","['ict', 'supply chain management', 'relationships', 'management']","['ict', 'supply chain management']",1.0,0.5
"P>Existing literature suggests that both state ownership and debt have detrimental performance consequences in transition economies. Paradoxically, however, we contend that the confluence of these two conditions may not be harmful. By considering the interactions between the governance properties of state ownership and debt, interpreted in light of the institutional context of China (i.e. the interplay between local governments, managers, and central banks), we argue that state ownership and debt can potentially offset each other's detrimental effects. We test our hypotheses with a sample of over 1300 Chinese firms that were listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock exchanges between 2003 and 2005. Results of the tests confirm that while debt and state ownership each have a negative impact on firm performance when used in isolation, their interaction has a positive impact on firm performance.","['nan', 'FREE CASH FLOW', 'CAPITAL STRUCTURE', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'PARTNER SELECTION', 'BUSINESS GROUPS', 'AGENCY THEORY', 'PANEL-DATA', 'CHINA']","['firm performance', 'china']","['state ownership', 'debt', 'transition economies', 'firms']",0.0,0.0
"This study examines the relationship of the entrepreneur's personality to long-term venture survival. We measure survival in two ways: (1) the likelihood the venture will survive for at least 8 years and (2) the overall life span of the venture. The Big Five personality attributes-extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience provide the measures of the entrepreneur's personality. As hypothesized, the entrepreneur's conscientiousness was positively related to long-term venture survival. Contrary to expectations, we found a negative relationship between the entrepreneur's openness and long-term venture survival. Extraversion, emotional stability, and agreeableness were unrelated to long-term venture survival. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

"Many organizations have implemented a variety of initiatives to address work-family conflict issues. This study investigates the impact of formal and informal work-family practices on both work-to-family and family-to-work conflict (WFC, FWC) and a broad set of job-related outcomes. We utilized structural equation modeling to analyze data from the 1997 National Study of the Changing Workforce (NSCW). Results showed that negative career consequences and lack of managerial support were significantly related to work-to-family conflict. These were significant predictors of conflict even when accounting for the effects of work schedule flexibility. Work-to-family conflict was linked to job dissatisfaction, turnover intentions and stress, while family-to-work conflict was linked to stress and absenteeism. There were no apparent differences between women and men in terms of the observed relationships. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

"For the past decade, project organization has become increasingly central to management and organization studies, particularly as these seek to discern the contours of post-modern organizations. Yet, these contours frequently seem to be sighted without bearings on the current realities of project management. In this paper we take such bearings, using data derived from detailed qualitative, ethnographic enquiry into the experience of project management. From this data we construct the contours of project management more sharply. Rather than being a harbinger of an autonomous and more democratic future, free from extant bureaucratic organization controls, we find that project management has distinct modalities of control that we outline in the paper: reputational, calculative, and professional. Indeed, rather than foreshadowing a future transformational form, we find traces of a much older design: that of de Tocqueville.","['nan', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION', 'NETWORKS', 'CULTURE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'FIRMS', 'POWER', 'FORM']",['form'],[],0,0.0
"Studies on the three types of process improvement programmes (Continuous Improvement, Reengineering and Benchmarking) have appeared many times in the literature. These studies suggest that certain organizational variables act as enablers and their presence or absence can significantly influence success rates. Such studies have tended to examine companies where a single programme has been implemented. In contrast, this paper examines a sample of companies who have experienced all three programmes. Our aim is to compare and contrast each programme's impact on firm performance and identify which organizational variables are common and which are programme-specific enablers of success. We build and test an integrative framework to support our analysis. Our study found that: (1) Reengineering delivered the greatest impact on performance; (2) executive commitment was needed to make this happen; (3) strategic alignment was the major influence on the success rate of Reengineering and Continuous Improvement programmes; and (4) employee empowerment was necessary for each programme to work effectively.","['nan', 'HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'BUSINESS', 'IMPACT']",['impact'],"['firm performance', 'executive commitment']",0.0,0.0

"Despite mounting interest in growth mindset interventions, this approach has yet to be applied to the domain of entrepreneurship. In the present research, we developed and tested if a growth mindset intervention could be leveraged to promote students' entrepreneurial self-efficacy and if this, in turn, predicted career development (i.e., academic interest, career interest, task persistence, and academic performance). We report on our findings, from an Open Science Framework (OSF) preregistered study, that is a randomized controlled trial implementing a growth mindset intervention. We randomly assigned undergraduate students (N= 238) in an introduction to entrepreneurship class to either the growth mindset intervention or to a knowledge-based attention-matched control. Students in the growth mindset intervention, relative to the control, reported greater entrepreneurial self-efficacy and task persistence on their main class project. The intervention also indirectly improved academic and career interest via entrepreneurial self-efficacy. However, the intervention failed to directly or indirectly impact performance on a classroom assignment. Additionally, and somewhat surprisingly, gender and past experience in the field failed to moderate any effects of the intervention on outcomes.

"The spread of innovation is usually characterized as a diffusion process. This article suggests that there may be some value in viewing this important phenomenon in terms of the mathematical construct known as percolation theory. J. Mort writes that phenomena and concepts such as induction periods, critical percolation thresholds, discrete propagation media, site coordination, clusters, and connective constants all have remarkable analogs in the generally observed features of product innovation. This phenomenological perspective, in which the customer emerges naturally as the controlling factor in the spread of innovations, may account for specific marketing approaches that have facilitated successful innovations such as the Xerox 914 copier. The approach may prove especially relevant in describing the spread of certain information, communication-based innovations, such as the explosive growth in facsimile (FAX), and other network-based products, as the utility and value of such products to the customer is inherently linked to the extant degree of connectivity.","['nan', 'PRODUCT']",['product'],"['percolation', 'innovation']",0.0,0.0
"This article documents a bias in people's causal inferences, showing that people nonnormatively consider an event's consequences when inferring its causes. Across experiments, participants' inferences about event causes were systematically affected by how similar (in both size and valence) those causes were to event consequences, even when the consequences were objectively uninformative about the causes. For example, people inferred that a product failure (computer crash) had a large cause (widespread computer virus) if it had a large consequence (job loss) but that the identical failure was more likely to have a smaller cause (cooling fan malfunction) if the consequence was small-even though the consequences gave no new information about what caused the crash. This consequence-cause matching, which can affect product attitudes, may arise because people are motivated to see the world as predictable and because matching is an accessible schema that helps them to fulfill this motivation.","['nan', 'COMPENSATORY CONTROL', 'ATTRIBUTION PROCESS', 'ATTITUDE FUNCTIONS', 'CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR', 'PERCEPTION', 'MAGNITUDE', 'VICTIM', 'REPRESENTATIVENESS', 'RESPONSIBILITY', 'INFORMATION']",['information'],['causal inferences'],0.0,0.0
"Barriers to entry in regulated markets are frequently conceptualized as static features that must be removed or overcome if new entrants are to successfully enter a market. But government institutions regulating markets often comprise multiple levels that exist in tension with one another due to differing incentives and motivations. We argue that the principal-agent tension between elected officials and agency bureaucrats may render regulatory barriers to entry more malleable, even in the absence of formal policy changes. To test this proposition, we bring the administrative state center stage and examine how regulatory discretion-regulatory agencies' flexibility to interpret and implement public policies created by elected officials-can influence the market entry of new ventures. Using data on regulatory approval of hydroelectric facilities in the United States from 1978 to 2014, we find that increased state agency discretion improves outcomes for new ventures relative to incumbent firms by freeing regulatory agency officials to interpret and implement policies according to a professional motivation of public service and reducing incumbents' political influence.","['institutional theory', 'entrepreneurship', 'nonmarket strategy', 'regulated markets', 'regulatory discretion', 'principal-agent', 'administrative state', 'PUBLIC-POLICY', 'POLITICAL CONTROL', 'LOBBYING EXPENDITURES', 'SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS', 'US', 'EVOLUTION', 'STRATEGY', 'CAPTURE', 'LOGICS', 'ENTRY']","['regulated markets', 'regulatory discretion', 'principal agent', 'administrative state', 'us', 'entry']","['regulated markets', 'entry', 'new ventures', 'firms', 'political influence']",0.4,0.3333333333333333

"Entrepreneurial autonomy among franchisees is a persistent management challenge. There is a lack of empirical synthesis of its drivers, its consequences, and how it can be integrated with the standardization requirements in franchise systems. Various theoretical and empirical studies have stressed that merging franchisee autonomy with the franchisor's desire for uniformity is extremely difficult. This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the relevant empirical studies in order to identify a range of influences, controls, outcomes and associated moderating and mediating factors that offer a better representation of what contributes to the understanding of franchisee entrepreneurial autonomy. By drawing together findings from a broad range of theoretical perspectives, the evidence was used to develop a comprehensive model of entrepreneurial autonomy in franchised outlets. The model not only provides a structure that brings together prior studies, but also identifies the less researched areas that can advance the management literature on the notion of autonomy in franchising. The research and practitioner implications of the review and its limitations and possible directions for future studies are discussed.","['nan', 'AGENCY-THEORY', 'INSTITUTIONAL INFLUENCES', 'FUTURE CHALLENGES', 'DECISION RIGHTS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ORIENTATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'NETWORKS']","['management', 'perspective']",['standardization'],0.0,0.0

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the concept of supply chain resilience (SCRES) within a concept mapping framework to seek conceptual clarity, with an emphasis on SCRES definitions, essential elements and managerial practices. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic literature review was conducted of 103 peer-reviewed journal articles from the year 2000 to 2015, with the aim of answering a focus review question. Findings - Through analysis and synthesis of the literature, the study revealed three major constructs used to define SCRES: phases of resilience, resilience strategies and the capabilities needed to be resilient. Emerging from the capabilities construct are five core SCRES capabilities: the ability to anticipate, to adapt, to respond, to recover and to learn. Also, given the need to consolidate the various constructs of SCRES, the study identified 13 essential elements and 84 managerial practices that support firms to achieve the five capabilities, which are then linked to SCRES strategies and phases to establish the connections that provide an integrated view of the concept. Research limitations/implications - The explorative nature of this study and the role of the concept mapping framework, which does not empirically test the relationships in the model, are considered as limitations, to be addressed by the authors in future research. Originality/value - The originality of this paper lies in the classification of different features of SCRES through a comprehensive concept mapping framework that establishes relationships and interactions between them. This study, therefore, lays a foundation for testing these connections in future empirical studies.

"Relying on theoretical insights from the Job Demand-Control model, which links occupational characteristics to health, this paper provides the first causal evidence of the physical and mental health consequences of self-employment. I utilize German longitudinal data for the period 2002-2014 and difference-in-differences estimations to study switches from unemployment to self-employment (necessity entrepreneurship) and transitions from regular- to self-employment (opportunity entrepreneurship). I find that necessity entrepreneurs experience improvements in their mental but not physical health, while opportunity entrepreneurship leads to both physical and mental health gains. Importantly, the health improvements cannot be explained by changes in income or working conditions and are not driven by personality and risk preferences or the local unemployment conditions. As such, the findings highlight an additional non-monetary benefit of self-employment and have implications for entrepreneurship theory and practice, current and would-be entrepreneurs, as well as policy-makers.","['Mental health', 'Physical health', 'Self-employment', 'Difference-in-differences', 'STRESS-RELATED HEALTH', 'JOB DISPLACEMENT', 'PHYSICAL HEALTH', 'MENTAL-HEALTH', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'PERSONALITY', 'UNEMPLOYMENT', 'SATISFACTION', 'WORK', 'DEMANDS']","['mental health', 'physical health', 'self employment', 'difference in differences', 'physical health', 'mental health', 'entrepreneurship', 'personality', 'unemployment', 'work']","['health', 'self employment', 'unemployment', 'opportunity entrepreneurship']",0.5,0.2
"This article suggests that the context and process of resource selection have an important influence on firm heterogeneity and sustainable competitive advantage. It is argued that a firm's sustainable advantage depends on its ability to manage the instructional context of its resource decisions. A firm's institutional context includes its internal culture as well as broader influences from the state, society, and interfirm relations that define socially acceptable economic behavior. A process model of firm heterogeneity is proposed that combines the insights of a resource-based view,with the institutional perspective from organization theory. Nonnative rationality institutional isolating mechanisms, and institutional sources of firm homogeneity are proposed as determinants of rent potential that complement and extend resource-based explanations of firm variation and sustainable competitive advantage.

"Boards of directors have a number of roles. The board's monitoring function has been the subject of much work. Less examined is the role that the board has in setting company strategy. This paper uses agency and network perspectives in developing and testing the relationship between board characteristics and involvement in strategic decision making. Using primary and secondary data, our results suggest that the level of board involvement in strategic decision making is related to a number of governance variables. We demonstrate that involvement is generally lower where boards are highly interlocked. We also show that certain types of board interlocks - namely horizontal (same industry) and those involving direct links with the banking sector - are particularly associated with this negative effect. There is weaker evidence that board strategic involvement is lower where the roles of company chief executive and chair are combined. We find no evidence that factors such as board size, or the percentage of outside directors per se are related to board involvement in strategic decision making. In doing so, this paper adds to the growing literature synthesizing the structural features and processes of boards.","['nan', 'CEO COMPENSATION', 'INTERLOCKING DIRECTORATES', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'US CORPORATIONS', 'TOP', 'NETWORK', 'MANAGEMENT', 'POWER', 'PERSPECTIVE']","['network', 'perspective']","['boards', 'directors']",0.0,0.0
"A switch from single-to multichannel grocery shopping can affect consumers' purchase allocations. This study investigates whether and to what extent a consumer's decision to start buying groceries online at a particular chain can lead to expansion of the share in grocery spending allocated to that chain. To obtain a better insight into the underlying mechanisms and to provide more accurate and refined managerial guidelines, we further investigate the moderating effects of a comprehensive set of factors that may stimulate or withhold these expansion effects. To analyze these effects, we use a large and representative U.K. household panel data set, composed of multichannel grocery shoppers and a matched group of single-channel shoppers, for a 2.5-year period across all multichannel grocery chains. The empirical analysis confirms that multichannel grocery shoppers expand the share of wallet allocated to the online-visited chain, and that the extent of this expansion depends on chain as well as consumer characteristics. Expansion effects appear to be more profound for chains that adopt an integrated multichannel strategy for product prices and category assortments.

"Multinational corporations (MNCs) use their overseas subsidiaries to access tacit knowledge about host countries. It is generally assumed that subsidiary tacit knowledge contributes directly to greater product innovativeness; however, little empirical evidence supports this assumption. In this research, the authors propose a negative direct relationship between subsidiary tacit-knowledge level and MNCs' product innovation ability. The authors then examine the role of social cognitive capability as an attenuator of this negative relationship between subsidiary tacit-knowledge level and MNCs' product innovation ability. The results reveal that each of the MNCs' social cognitive capability components (i.e., task efficacy, organic structure, and affective trust) independently weakens this negative relationship. Moreover, combining social cognitive capabilities exerts synergetic influences to further excavate the effect of tacit knowledge.","['product innovation', 'multinational corporation knowledge flows', 'social cognitive theory', 'multinational subsidiary management', 'tacit-knowledge transfer', 'MARKETING CAPABILITIES', 'SELF-EFFICACY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TRUST', 'FIRMS', 'SUBSIDIARIES', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'ACQUISITION', 'REGRESSION', 'FRAMEWORK']","['product innovation', 'trust', 'subsidiaries']","['multinational', 'tacit knowledge', 'innovation', 'social cognitive capability', 'task efficacy', 'trust']",0.16666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
"We demonstrate the critical need to recognize the presence of two different types of satisfaction for effective channel governance-economic satisfaction, that is, a channel member's evaluation of the economic outcomes that flow from the relationship with its partner and social satisfaction, a channel member's evaluation of the personal contacts and interactions with its exchange partner Measurement instruments permitting channel researchers to make the distinction between economic and social satisfaction are developed and tested lire provide evidence on the relevance of this distinction by showing that the hco types of satisfaction occupy unique positions in a nomological network as determined by differential relations with partner's use of power and responses to channel relationship problems. The implications of these differences in effects are discussed and indicate that channel managers should be aware of the kind of satisfaction they are fostering in their channel counterparts.","['nan', 'JOB-SATISFACTION', 'VOICE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LOYALTY', 'NEGLECT', 'EXIT', 'POWER', 'RESPONSES', 'MODEL', 'DISSATISFACTION']","['power', 'responses']",['governance'],0.0,0.0
"The HIV virus is now an international killer, but individuals perceive that they are less likely to contract the virus than are others (the self-positivity bias). Three studies investigate the antecedents and consequences of the self-positivity bias in judgments of the risk of contracting AIDS. We show that the perceived similarity of another person to oneself and the ease with which related information can be retrieved from memory (the accessibility of information) moderate self-perceptions of risk in an absolute sense and reduce the self-positivity bias. We then demonstrate that increasing the accessibility of a cause of AIDS, in an advertisement propounding safe sex, increases perceptions of one's own risk of contracting AIDS, reduces the self-positivity bias, leads to more favorable attitudes and intentions toward practicing precautionary behaviors (e.g., using condoms, taking an HIV test), and also leads to deeper processing of AIDS educational material. Theoretical implications regarding the use of the accessibility of information as a cue and the self-positivity bias are discussed, and recommendations for social marketing communications are offered.","['nan', 'UNREALISTIC OPTIMISM', 'PROXY-REPORTS', 'SELF', 'AVAILABILITY', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'STRATEGIES', 'CONFIDENCE', 'RETRIEVAL', 'FREQUENCY', 'BEHAVIOR']","['self', 'behavior']",['self positivity bias'],0.0,0.0
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide insights and describe teleological approaches in the context of Supply Chain Management (SCM). Design/methodology/approach A conceptual framework is outlined derived from complexity sciences to widen and enhance the exploration and understanding of SCM. Findings Research and literature in the field of SCM have to a large extent neglected the possible underlying formative and rationalist nature of it, rather than considering or highlighting its potentially transformative nature. Research limitations/implications Teleological approaches of SCM provide valuable insights in managing supply chains. They also provide innovative and challenging opportunities for further research in the field of SCM. Practical implications The application of teleological approaches in supply chains may encourage and lead to managerial ideas and insights to anticipate and avoid deficient or erroneous grounds in the planning, implementation and evaluation of SCM. Originality/value Teleological approaches make a contribution to the ongoing exploration and discussion of SCM, such as: incorporating a frame of reference from complexity sciences. The author believes that it also provides a timely topic in times of crisis as it compares different teleological approaches some more dynamic and flexible than others.","['Supply chain management', 'Complexity theory', 'nan']",['supply chain management'],"['approaches', 'supply chain management', 'complexity sciences']",0.3333333333333333,1.0

"Recent interest in the growth of subcontracting, as part of a broader trend towards greater 'flexibility' in forms of employment relationship, has not as yet been matched by a full consideration of its organizational and managerial implications. In particular, the question of whether or not subcontracting has an impact upon, or is affected by, the organization's structural characteristics remains largely unexplored. The aim of this article is to report findings from a detailed study of subcontracting practices across a sample of British industry, which focuses upon the relationship between subcontracting and organizational characteristics. The results indicate several important points about the practice. Firstly, that there is wide variation in the use of subcontracting across industry, although the overall extent is limited. Secondly, that variation in the practice is significantly related to basic firm characteristics - namely, industrial sector, type of production system and pattern of ownership and control. Thirdly, that, on balance, subcontracting is associated with more, not less, structural complexity. Finally, that this greater complexity is found in particular types of firms - notably, outside the manufacturing sector, in mass and process production systems and amongst British independents and subsidiaries, rather than in their foreign competitors.","['nan', 'FLEXIBILITY', 'MARKETS']",['flexibility'],[],0,0.0
"Alliances are often formed as a response to challenges from both market and social forces. Although the resource dependence logic posits that firms enter into alliances to stabilize resource flows between different markets and also to increase market power in their primary industry, it remains unclear whether the social power of firms, generated from alliance networks, may motivate firms to respond differently to the dependence logic of alliance formation. By incorporating social network theory, we argue that a firm's social network advantages in the primary industry may serve as critical contingency conditions of the dependence logic. Analyses of firms in the U.S. computer industry from 1994 to 2007 suggest that a firm's centrality advantage marginally reduces the positive effects of market dependencies on alliance formation, whereas a firm's brokerage advantage enhances the market dependence effect.","['alliance formation', 'market dependence', 'alliance network', 'centrality', 'brokerage', 'STRUCTURAL HOLES', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'SOCIAL-STRUCTURE', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'POWER', 'EMBEDDEDNESS', 'CENTRALITY', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'EXPLOITATION', 'ENVIRONMENT']","['alliance formation', 'market dependence', 'alliance network', 'centrality', 'brokerage', 'power', 'centrality']",[],0,0.0
"This article examines whether agency or stewardship is the more effective form of managerial governance within family firms. Synthesizing arguments regarding the differential tendencies of nonfamily versus family managers and the bifurcated manner in which they are likely to be governed, we propose asymmetric responses to agency versus stewardship mechanisms.

Although our findings also provide evidence of response asymmetry, they nevertheless point to the greater effectiveness of stewardship over agency governance irrespective of a manager's family affiliation.","['family firm governance', 'agency theory', 'stewardship theory', 'family and nonfamily managers', 'bifurcation bias', 'SELF-DETERMINATION', 'CONCEPTUAL ISSUES', 'NEED SATISFACTION', 'GOAL ALIGNMENT', 'FIRMS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'COMMITMENT', 'EMPLOYEES', 'IMPACT']","['firms', 'behavior']","['stewardship', 'governance', 'family firms', 'agency governance']",0.0,0.0
"The authors analyze data from two cross-national studies to explore differences in organizational buyers' normative expectations of supplier performance. These normative expectations encompass what buyers perceive as business standards or norms, regardless of product/service, supplier, or industry The first study (four countries) pinpoints the normative expectations that help explain why managers across countries may, evaluate the same supplier performance differently. The second study provides an illustrative example of these differences in a separate sample drawn from the same four countries. The inclusion of such normative expectations of supplier performance has the potential to add explanatory power to models of performance evaluation in international business-to-business relationships. The findings suggest that if differences in normative expectations of supplier performance are not taken into account, performance ratings may be distorted indicators of actual performance.","['normative expectations', 'business-to-business services', 'supplier performance', 'national differences', 'organizational buying behavior', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'SERVICE QUALITY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'CULTURE', 'MODEL', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERSPECTIVES', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'COMPLEXITY', 'EXPERIENCE']","['normative expectations', 'supplier performance', 'model']",[],0,0.0

"A business incubator - in collaboration with the community in which it operates - is a producer of business assistance programs. The entrepreneurial ventures located in an incubator, as consumers of those outputs, operate in an interdependent co-production relationship with the incubator. This study explores the types of business assistance provided through co-production, the modes of co-production, and factors that affect the variability of impact. The allocation of the time of the incubator manager, the intensity of intervention, the breadth of co-production modalities deployed, and the readiness of the entrepreneur to engage in co-production are revealed as factors affecting the output elasticities related to co-production inputs.

"Research Summary: Using arguments derived from transactions cost economics and incomplete contract theory, this article shows that the assumption that shareholders are a firm's only residual claimants is logically inconsistent with resource-based theory's model of profit generation. It follows from this conclusion that resource-based theory's model of profit appropriation must incorporate a stakeholder perspective. Some theoretical and empirical implications of this conclusion for resource-based theory's model of profit generation, profit appropriation, the role of managers and entrepreneurs in resource-based theory, and how conflicting interests among stakeholders can be resolved are all discussed. Finally, some continuing differences between stakeholder theory and incorporating a stakeholder perspective into resource-based theory's model of profit appropriation are also discussed. Managerial Summary: Some argue that since shareholders are the only stakeholder who have a claim on a firm's profits, managers should focus only on maximizing shareholder wealth. Not only will this satisfy shareholders, it will also satisfy a firm's other stakeholders, since-in principle-these other stakeholders get paid before shareholders. This article shows that this logic is deeply flawed. In particular, it shows that if the only stakeholder who has a claim on a firm's economic profits is shareholders, then-in most competitive settings-a firm will not be able to attract the kinds of resources it needs to generate these profits. To attract the kinds of resources that can generate profits, managers must recognize that stakeholders, besides shareholders, have claims on the profits that their resources help generate. This, in turn, suggests that managers seeking to generate economic profits must adopt a stakeholder perspective in how they manage their firm. This article explores the managerial implications of this conclusion.","['incomplete contract theory', 'resource-based theory', 'shareholder supremacy', 'stakeholder theory', 'transactions cost theory', 'SUSTAINED COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'RENT APPROPRIATION', 'PROPERTY-RIGHTS', 'FIRM RESOURCES', 'PUBLIC-POLICY', 'VIEW', 'MANAGERIAL', 'MARKET', 'COSTS']","['incomplete contract theory', 'resource based theory', 'stakeholder theory', 'managerial']","['transactions cost economics', 'incomplete contract theory', 'firm', 'resource based theory', 'model', 'profit generation', 'profit appropriation']",0.2857142857142857,0.5
"The open innovation (OI) paradigm emphasizes the importance of integrating inbound and outbound flows of technology to increase a firm's innovation performance. While the synergies between technology inflows and outflows have been discussed in conceptual OI articles, the majority of empirical studies have typically focused on either the inward or the outward dimension of OI. According to recent reviews of OI literature, there is a need for further research that takes an integrated perspective on this topic and studies the combination of the inbound and outbound dimensions of OI. This paper follows these calls by focusing on technology licensing as the main contractual form for OI, and by investigating the relationship between technology in-licensing and out-licensing activities at the firm level of analysis. In particular, this paper argues that technology in-licensing positively influences the volume of technology out-licensing through two mechanisms. The firstresource-basedoccurs because in-licensing investments expand and enrich the firm's technology base, thus increasing its value and, as a result, creating more opportunities for out-licensing. The secondcapabilities-basedoccurs because, due to commonalities between technology in-licensing and out-licensing in terms of performed tasks and required skills, repeated execution of in-licensing transactions contributes to the development of higher out-licensing capabilities and, as a result, increase out-licensing volume. These arguments are tested using a panel dataset of 837 Spanish manufacturing firms over the period 1998-2007. Consistent with the predictions, the empirical analysis shows that higher investments in in-licensing and more extensive in-licensing experience lead to superior volumes of technology out-licensing. These results contribute to research on OI and licensing, by empirically showing the existence of positive interactions between technology inflows and outflows and of synergies in the development of absorptive and desorptive capacities.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'PANEL-DATA MODELS', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'DEVELOPMENT ALLIANCES', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FIRMS', 'RESOURCES']","['empirical analysis', 'performance', 'firms']",['performance'],1.0,0.3333333333333333

Our findings challenge sex-stereotypic perspectives, showing that women persist more with male naysayers than with female naysayers but do so in a stereotypically low-status (more indirect than direct) manner. Women's adaptation of their persistence to naysayer gender appeared functional because increased persistence with male naysayers helped close a gender gap in performance, and female negotiators with high performance adjusted their manner of persistence more than those with low performance.","['nan', 'SEX-DIFFERENCES', 'SOCIAL-INTERACTION', 'SELF-ESTEEM', 'STEREOTYPES', 'WOMEN', 'POWER', 'MEN', 'BEHAVIOR', 'STYLE', 'TALK']","['women', 'men']","['women', 'performance']",0.5,0.5
"Building on corporate governance research and institutional theory, this paper explores interrelationships between the firm's corporate governance, responsible leadership, and corporate social responsibility approaches in different institutional contexts. We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory with its focus on corporate social responsibility as mere compliance with rules and regulations. We link different leadership orientations and corporate social responsibility approaches to two key process dimensions of corporate governance related to monitoring and incentives. This analysis builds on previous research that differentiates between governance mechanisms based on strategic as opposed to financial controls and explains how these types of control may be related to responsible managerial behavior and the firm's corporate social responsibility strategies. Building on governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory, we further argue that links between corporate social responsibility strategies and corporate governance factors such as boards of directors, ownership patterns, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop a more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational approaches to corporate social responsibility.","['nan', 'INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP', 'STAKEHOLDER THEORY', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'BOARD DIVERSITY', 'FIRM', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CSR', 'ORIENTATION', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'INCENTIVES']","['firm', 'orientation', 'incentives']","['corporate governance', 'institutional theory']",0.0,0.0

The study challenges the assumption in the sales literature that attributional dimensions cleanly map onto attributional ascriptions. Findings support that sales control systems affect salespeople's attribution processes in ways suggesting that the processes are more malleable than heretofore theorized in the marketing literature.

"We combine the formalism of a principal-agent framework with a value-based analysis in order to investigate the micro-foundations of business partner selection and the division of value in contracting relationships. In particular, we study how the key contracting parameters such as efficiency, transactional integrity, incentive alignment, and gaming affect outcomes when buyers face competing suppliers. We show that integrity and efficiency increase value creation and capture for all parties and are complements. While incentive gaming is unambiguously bad for value creation, and reduces buyers' value capture, it can benefit some suppliers. For alignment, we find that neither party has an incentive to use fully aligned performance measures that maximize total value creation. We conclude by analyzing buyers' and suppliers' incentives to invest in integrity.

"Purpose This study aims to examine publications of supply chain management (SCM) researchers from across the world and maps the leadership role of authors and institutions based on how prolific they are in publishing and on network measures of centrality while accounting for the quality of the outlets that they publish in. It aims to inform stakeholders on who the leading SCM scholars are, their primary areas of SCM research, their publication profiles and the nature of their networks. It also identifies and informs on the leading SCM research institutions of the world and where leadership in specific areas of SCM research is emerging from. Design/methodology/approach Based on SCM papers appearing in a set of seven leading journals over the 15-year period of 2001-2015, publication scores and social network analysis measures of total degree centrality and Bonacich power centrality are used to identify the highest ranked agents in SCM research overall, as well as in some specific areas of SCM research. Social network analysis is also used to examine the nature and scope of the networks of the ranked agents and where leadership in SCM research is emerging from. Findings Authors and institutions from the USA and UK are found to dominate much of the rankings in SCM research both by publication score and social network analysis measures of centrality. In examining the networks of the very top authors and institutions of the world, their networks are found to be more inward-looking (country-centric) than outward-looking (globally dispersed). Further, researchers in Europe and Asia alike are found to exhibit significant continental inclinations in their network formations with researchers in Europe displaying greater propensity to collaborate with their European-based counterparts and researchers in Asia with their Asian-based counterparts. Also, from among the journals, Supply Chain Management: An International Journal is found to exhibit a far more expansive global reach than any of the other journals. Research limitations/implications - The journal set used in this study, though representative of high-quality SCM research outlets, is not exhaustive of all potential outlets that publish SCM research. Further, the measure of quality that this study assigns to the various publications is based solely on a publication score that accounts for the quality of the journals, as rated by Association of Business Schools that the papers appear in and nothing else. Practical implications - By informing the community of stakeholders of SCM research about the top-ranked SCM authors, institutions and countries of the world, the nature of their networks, as well as what the primary areas of SCM research of the leading authors in the world are, this research provides stakeholders, including managers, researchers and students, information that is helpful to them not only because of the insights it provides but also for the gauging of potential for embedding themselves in specific networks, engaging in collaborative research with the leading agents or pursuing educational opportunities with them. Originality/value This research is the first of its kind to identify and rank the top SCM authors and institutions from across the world using a representative set of seven leading SCM and primary OM journals based on publication scores and social network measures of centrality.

"While a great deal of scholastic effort has gone into discovering the multifaceted relationships between applied research initiatives and subsequent performance, relatively little empirical research addresses the performance impact from firm investments in basic research initiatives. Even less addresses the interactive roles of both types of research. The authors conceptualize and empirically evaluate the interactive relationship between applied and basic research initiatives and firm performance. Applied and basic research projects are knowledge creation activities in a product development domain, and both initiatives enhance the stored knowledge of a firm. Stored knowledge is the fuel that drives the product development engine. Applied research initiatives assimilate and exploit stored knowledge to develop new products. Basic research initiatives contribute to and enhance the stock of knowledge from which the applied initiatives are drawn. This expanded base of stored knowledge has positive rami. cations for subsequent applied research initiatives. Results indicate that firms that engage in moderate or higher levels of applied research will see enhanced performance returns from additional investments in basic research. Conversely,firms that engage in relatively lower levels of applied research see no performance enhancement at any level of investment in basic research. Firms that rely on a flow of product innovations to provide a continued income stream must certainly invest in applied research initiatives. However, additional investment in directed basic research initiatives will augment future applied projects and could become the source of sustainable competitive advantage.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'FIRMS', 'CAPABILITIES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INDUSTRIAL', 'INNOVATION', 'MARKET']","['product development', 'firms', 'performance', 'innovation']",['innovations'],0.0,0.0

Limited support is found for the hypothesis that larger firms' reputations will be buffered front the adverse effects of a layoff on their reputations. Implications of this research and future research questions are discussed.","['corporate reputation', 'layoffs', 'attribution', 'performance', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'CORPORATE', 'RESOURCE', 'ANNOUNCEMENTS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'SURVIVORS', 'STRATEGY', 'IMPACT', 'SIZE']","['layoffs', 'resource', 'impact']",['layoffs'],1.0,0.3333333333333333
"This paper focuses on the role of managerial cognition as a source of heterogeneity in firm strategies and performance. We link differences in mental models to differences in decision rules and performance in a management simulation. Our results show more accurate mental models lead to better decision rules and higher performance. We also find that decision makers do not need accurate knowledge of the entire business environment; accurate mental models of the key principles are sufficient to achieve superior performance. A fundamental assumption in much of strategic management is that managers who have a richer understanding about organizational capabilities and the dynamics of industry structure can improve the performance of their firms. Our findings provide empirical evidence supporting this assumption and show that differences in mental models help explain ex ante why managers and firms adopt different strategies and achieve different levels of competitive success.

"By examining the premiums paid by acquiring firms in cross-border acquisitions (CBAs), this study aims to determine why they might rely on prior premium decisions in the host market rather than rigorous assessments of the deal. An information-based imitation framework offers an explanation for foreign acquirers' premium decisions. The developed hypotheses are tested with 2350 CBAs that occurred during 1995-2008. The results show that the premium paid by acquiring firms in CBAs relates positively to prior premiums paid by foreign acquirers in that host country. This imitation behavior is influenced by both organization- and offering-level characteristics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"The ability to transfer best practices internally is critical to a firm's ability to build competitive advantage through the appropriation of rents from scarce internal knowledge. Just as a firm's distinctive competencies might be difficult for other firms to imitate, its best practices could be difficult to imitate internally. Yet, little systematic attention has been paid to such internal stickiness. The author analyzes internal stickiness of knowledge transfer and tests the resulting model using canonical correlation analysis of a data set consisting of 271 observations of 122 best-practice transfers in eight companies. Contrary to conventional wisdom that blames primarily motivational factors, the study findings show the major barriers to internal knowledge transfer to be knowledge-related factors such as the recipient's lack of absorptive capacity, causal ambiguity, and an arduous relationship between the source and the recipient.","['internal stickiness', 'best practice transfer', 'knowledge transfer', 'knowledgement management', 'rent appropriation', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'CAPABILITIES', 'ADAPTATION', 'INNOVATION', 'COMPETENCE', 'PATTERNS', 'NETWORK', 'MODEL']","['internal stickiness', 'best practice transfer', 'knowledge transfer', 'competitive advantage', 'knowledge', 'model']","['advantage', 'absorptive capacity causal ambiguity', 'recipient']",0.0,0.0
"In this paper we illustrate how boundary theory can be a useful perspective to understand the dynamics of family businesses. We integrate insights from the family business literature with the work-family and identity boundary literatures to describe degrees of integration between the family and business identities in family firms and outline contingencies that influence this integration. We also develop the notion of differential permeability as a state of being both integrated and segmented on various aspects of identity and articulate costs and benefits to this state, as well as to high integration and high segmentation. Finally, we invoke the research on boundary work as a means of managing family business boundaries and conclude by outlining additional avenues of research that stem from using such a boundary theory lens.","['nan', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'EXPLORATORY EVIDENCE', 'CONCEPTUAL ISSUES', 'CONTROLLED FIRMS', 'HUMAN-RESOURCES', 'ROLE-CONFLICT', 'AGENCY COSTS', 'WORK', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'PERSPECTIVE']","['work', 'perspective']","['identity', 'family firms']",0.0,0.0
"Interest in the important role that ethical leaders play in organizations has expanded in recent years because of several high-profile corporate ethical breakdowns and the increased responsibility placed upon corporate leaders as a result. In the present study, we introduce a new outcome of ethical leadership: group ethical voice. We further theorized and tested two mediating mechanisms linking ethical leadership with group ethical voice. Using two field studies and one experimental study, we found support for our assertion that ethical leadership was positively associated with group ethical voice. We also found support for most of our hypothesized mediating mechanisms (ethical culture and group ethical voice efficacy) linking ethical leadership with group ethical voiceexcept for the indirect effect of upper-level ethical leadership on group ethical voice via group ethical voice efficacy.

"An essential characteristic of marketing practice and theory is the promotion of exchanges, many of which are funded by money. Marketing literature thus places great emphasis on determining what factors influence consumers to engage in the marketplace. Less understood, however, is how consumers allocate monetary resources to fund exchanges. Scholars have demonstrated that people employ earmarks to segregate money by source, meaning, or purpose. The ethnographic study of provisioning in the current research adds to prior scholarship with an explanation of how money, as a fungible resource, is transformed into moral and social resources by the behavioral process of ascribing earmarks and approaching provisioning. As part of this study, the author develops a typology that incorporates thrift provisioning and splurge provisioning approaches to categorize consumer goals derived from the use of prosaic and indexical earmarks. These goals are defined as economizing, sustaining, treating, and rewarding. The article closes with a discussion of implications for marketing managers and potential avenues for further research.","['earmarks', 'money', 'provisioning', 'moral resources', 'social resources', 'CONSUMER', 'CONSUMPTION', 'PURCHASE', 'RITUALS', 'HEALTH', 'TIME']","['earmarks', 'money', 'provisioning', 'social resources', 'consumer']","['thrift', 'splurge']",0.0,0.0
"While the service literature repeatedly emphasizes the role of empathy in service interactions, studies on empathy in customer-employee interactions are nearly absent. This study defines and conceptualizes employee and customer empathy as multidimensional constructs and empirically investigates their impact on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. A quantitative study based on dyadic data and a multilevel modeling approach finds support for two effects of empathy in service interactions. The study reveals that customer empathy strengthens the positive effect of employee empathy on customer satisfaction, leading to more symbiotic interactions. The findings also indicate that empathic customers are more likely to respond to a dissatisfying encounter with forgiveness, in the sense that customer empathy is able to mitigate negative effects of customer dissatisfaction on customer loyalty. From these empirical results, the authors derive several implications for service research and the management of service encounters. In particular, the present study provides a valuable basis for strategies of interaction routing, that is, matching customers and employees on the basis of their psychological profiles to create smooth and satisfying service interactions. The authors elaborate on approaches to implement this strategy in service organizations.","['service encounter', 'employee-customer interaction', 'customer empathy', 'employee empathy', 'customer satisfaction', 'customer loyalty', 'PERSPECTIVE-TAKING', 'SERVICE QUALITY', 'SATISFACTION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'SALESPERSON', 'FORGIVENESS', 'ATTRIBUTION', 'OUTCOMES', 'RAPPORT', 'MODEL']","['service encounter', 'customer empathy', 'employee empathy', 'customer satisfaction', 'customer loyalty', 'satisfaction', 'forgiveness', 'model']","['empathy', 'customer empathy', 'customer satisfaction', 'customer loyalty', 'forgiveness', 'customer dissatisfaction', 'encounters']",0.5714285714285714,0.5
"Universities are seen as a source of technology development that is useful to entrepreneurial activity. As a result, policy makers often consider mechanisms to stimulate technology commercialization at research universities as a way to encourage entrepreneurial activity in a region. However, the transfer of technology from universities to the private sector requires the exploitation of markets for knowledge, which are fraught with difficulty [Arrow, K., 1962. Economic welfare and the allocation of resources for inventions. In: Nelson, R. (Ed.), The Rate and Direction of Inventive Activity. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.]. This article examines the effect of one U.S. public policy initiative-the Bayh-Dole Act in the United States-on one aspect of technology commercialization-university patenting. Specifically, the article explores the university share of patents from 1969 through 1996 across 117 lines of business, and shows that the effectiveness of licensing in a line of business is significantly correlated with university share of patents in the post-Bayh-Dole period, but not in the pre-Bayh-Dole period. These results suggest that the Bayh-Dole Act provided incentives for universities to increase patenting in those fields in which licensing is an effective mechanism for acquiring new technical knowledge. The paper discusses the implications of this shift in patenting for research and public policy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

"This study examines the usage and outcomes of organization development (OD) interventions in multinational firms. We test competing hypotheses derived from the cultural and institutional/isomorphic perspectives Data from firms operating in Hong Kong show that Western firms (U.S. and European) are more receptive to OD interventions than Asian firms (local and Japanese), which supports the cultural explanation. However, the local isomorphism explanation is valid in predicting organizational outcomes that OD interventions have similar effects regardless of a firm's country origins. Hence, neither perspective alone is sufficient to explain both usage and outcomes. This implies that local adaptation of OD interventions is a complex issue for managing multinational firms.","['nan', 'HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT', 'NATIONAL CULTURE', 'IRON CAGE', 'HONG-KONG', 'SUBSIDIARIES', 'CORPORATIONS', 'STRATEGY', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'INDUSTRY']",['hong kong'],['isomorphism'],0.0,0.0
"We examine the interrelationship between export and domestic sales. Our expectation is that they tire simultaneously determined, and as such should not be examined in isolation. We also investigate how firm factors-such as R&D and advertising investments-and external factors-such as market growth and exchange rate changes-impact export and domestic sales. Using a non-recursive system of equations, we test our arguments on a representative sample of Spanish manufacturing firms between 1990 and 1997. We find significant interrelationships between export anti domestic sales with striking differences between Spanish-owned firms and foreign-owned firms operating in Spain. For Spanish-owned firms, domestic and export sales are complements. These firms appear to focus on the domestic market and strength in the domestic market drives their export sales. In contrast, domestic and export sales are substitutes for foreign owned firms. These firms' export strategies appear subsumed under strategies of managing a multinational network in which the focus is sales outside of Spain. We discuss the importance of these findings for understanding and managing export strategies.

"This study notes that the lack of convergent and discriminant validity of assessment center ratings in the presence of content-related and criterion-related validity is paradoxical within a unitarian framework Of validity. It also empirically demonstrates an application of generalizability theory to examining the convergent and discriminant validity of assessment center dimensional ratings. Generalizability analyses indicated that person, dimension, and person by dimension effects contribute large proportions of variance to the total variance in assessment center ratings. Alternately exercise, rater person by exercise, and dimension by exercise effects are shown to contribute little to the total variance. Correlational and confirmatory factor analyses results were consistent with the generalizability results. This provides strong evidence for the convergent and discriminant validity of the assessment center dimension ratings - a finding consistent with the conceptual underpinnings of the unitarian view of validity and inconsistent with previously reported results.

"The process by which managers implement marketing plans in smaller industrial organizations has yet to be conceptualized in ways that can spur theoretical development or speak to the practical realities of managers from this growing, important segment of American industry. This article, based on an exploratory study of marketing strategy processes in 50 smaller entrepreneurial organizations develops a framework to stimulate thinking and an inventory of propositions for future testing The study finds market planning and implementation inextricably linked. Marketing implementation emerges as an organization's adaptive response to day-to-day market events that is rarely scripted by plans and as a process that involves purposeful actions and improvisations as much as stop-gap actions and firefights. The nature and extent of implementation-related improvisations appear to directly affect a firm's market orientation, rate of growth, and strategic effectiveness.","['nan', 'STRATEGY-MAKING PROCESSES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ADAPTATION', 'CHOICE', 'MODEL', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DETERMINISM', 'CONTINGENCY', 'ORIENTATION', 'PERSPECTIVE']",['orientation'],['strategy'],0.0,0.0

"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the non-academic impact in supply chain management (SCM) research through the application of three distinctive approaches to phenomenological methodology in different contexts. Design/methodology/approach Evidence-based examples from three case studies using interpretivist, social constructivist and critical realist methodologies are presented. They reflect non-positivist approaches commonly used in phenomenological methodology and adopted in SCM investigative research. Findings Different types of non-academic reach and significance from each research methodology are discussed to illustrate the non-academic impact benefits from each case. The three distinctive phenomenological approaches have been shown to contribute to innovative research methodology development on their own philosophical merit and produced novel contributions to SCM research in particular. Originality/value The paper highlights the relevance of phenomenological research methodology for SCM. It also contributes to the development of the SCM subject area and is hoped to encourage further reporting of non-academic impact of supply chain research.","['UK', 'Fashion', 'Impact', 'Supply chain management', 'Logistics management', 'Qualitative research', 'Research methodology', 'Research philosophy', 'Non-academic impact', 'RESEARCH GUIDELINES', 'FRAMEWORK', 'SUSTAINABILITY', 'INTEGRATION', 'STRATEGIES', 'DYNAMICS']","['impact', 'supply chain management', 'research methodology', 'non academic impact']","['supply chain management', 'methodology']",0.5,0.25
"Research Summary We consider the link between firms' decisions to adopt a CSR executive position and the political ideology of prior adopter CEOs. We theorize that firms are more likely to adopt a CSR executive position when it has been previously adopted by conservative-leaning CEOs at other firms, as opposed to liberal-leaning CEOs. This effect is due, we argue, to the increased perceptual salience and situational attributions associated with ideologically incongruent actions (i.e., actions that appear inconsistent with known political values). We further posit that these effects are stronger when the observing firms experience increased salience of CSR issues due to shareholder pressure and institutional equivalence between the referent and the observing firms. We find support for these ideas in a longitudinal sample of Fortune 500 companies. Managerial Summary How do CEOs' values affect industry-wide appointments of senior executives in charge of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)? Prior research suggests that liberal political beliefs of CEOs predict their CSR commitments. Our study explores how the political beliefs of CEOs-in this case, CEOs who have created a new CSR executive position in their companies-influence the likelihood that peer CEOs will imitate their decisions. Specifically, we find that when conservative CEOs adopt a CSR executive position, other companies are more likely to follow than when liberal-leaning CEOs do so. These effects are even stronger when companies are experiencing CSR-related pressure from shareholders and when they belong to the same industry and community as the firms of the CEOs they are observing.","['corporate social responsibility', 'diffusion', 'political ideology', 'top management teams', 'upper echelons', 'PERSON MEMORY', 'POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES', 'INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS', 'CEO CHARACTERISTICS', 'SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS', 'DIFFUSION', 'ACTIVISM', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'SALIENCE', 'RISK']","['corporate social responsibility', 'political ideology', 'salience']","['political ideology', 'political values', 'institutional equivalence', 'corporate social responsibility']",0.5,0.6666666666666666

"This paper examines the impact of institutional, and transaction cost specific variables on MNEs' choice of equity ownership in their foreign affiliates. We consider the determinants of the choice of foreign investors between full ownership (setting up a wholly owned greenfield subsidiary or engaging in a full acquisition) and sharing ownership with a local firm (establishing a greenfield joint venture or making a partial acquisition). Drawing on both transaction cost and institutional theories, a number of hypotheses are developed. Based on a dataset of 6838 foreign affiliates in Turkey, the empirical analysis reveals that institutional variables are important in explaining the equity composition of foreign affiliates. Particularly important in determining equity ownership were found to be political risk, cultural distance, linguistic distance, agglomeration, location and the size of the affiliate. A distinguishing feature of the paper is that we examine the marginal effects of the independent variables in explaining ownership patterns of MNEs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

"This research compares the positioning of women entrepreneurs through entrepreneurship policy over two decades (1989-2012) in Sweden and the United States. Given Sweden's uniquely family-friendly welfare state, we could expect different results, yet in both countries we find a legacy of discourse subordinating women's entrepreneurship to other goals (i.e., economic growth) and a positioning of women as 'other', reinforcing a dialogue of women's inadequacy or extraordinariness without taking full account of the conditions shaping women's work experience. From this analysis we derive a conceptual schematic of assumptions presented through the discourse, aligning and distinguishing the U.S. and Swedish approaches. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"Generally, radical innovations are not easily adopted in the market. Potential adopters experience difficulties to comprehend and evaluate radical innovations due to their newness in terms of technology and benefits offered. Consequently, adoption intentions may remain low. This paper proposes bundling as an instrument to address these problems. More specifically, this paper examines how consumer comprehension, evaluation, and adoption intention of radical innovations may be enhanced by bundling such products with existing products. In addition, it is argued that the proposed effects are contingent upon the level of fit perceived to exist between the radical innovation and the product that accompanies it in the bundle. Furthermore, consumers' prior knowledge may affect the influence of bundling on the innovation adoption process as the interpretation of the meaning of new products may be strongly related to prior knowledge. This study therefore investigates whether consumer prior knowledge has such a moderating effect. Hypotheses are tested by means of an experimental study with three different radical innovations and distinguishing among offering the radical innovation separately, offering the radical innovation in a bundle with moderate perceived fit between the products, and offering the radical innovation in a bundle with high perceived fit between the products. Results show that product bundling enhances the new product's evaluation and adoption intention, although it does not increase comprehension of the radical innovation. Moreover, the results show that comprehension, evaluation and adoption intention of the innovation significantly decrease when consumers perceive a moderate fit between the products in a bundle. Taken together, these findings contribute to the bundling literature by showing not only that product bundling may indeed be an effective instrument to introduce a radical innovation but also that product bundling may be counterproductive when ignoring the critical role of perceived product fit as core characteristic of a product bundle. In addition, the notion that product bundling helps to enhance the evaluation and purchase intention of new and relatively complex products suggests a suitable strategy for new product managers to enhance benefits and reduce learning costs for radical innovations. Moreover, the effects of bundling on consumer appraisals of radical innovations are also shown to depend on the level of knowledge respondents possess regarding the product category of the radical innovation. More specifically, if bundled with a familiar product, novices tend to evaluate the innovative product more positively, but for experts no such effect can be detected. As such, these results provide additional specific implications for managers when introducing radical innovations in the market. Offering a radical innovation in a product bundle could be a fruitful strategy for companies that target customers with little or no prior knowledge in the product domain.","['nan', 'CONSUMER EVALUATIONS', 'PRIOR KNOWLEDGE', 'AD', 'ATTRIBUTES', 'PREFERENCE', 'STRATEGY', 'ANALOGY', 'PRICES', 'MODEL', 'RISK']","['prior knowledge', 'ad', 'strategy']",['knowledge'],0.0,0.0

"According to transaction cost economics (TCE) reasoning, firms choose equity (as opposed to non-equity) foreign market entry modes to safeguard specific assets. The present paper contextualizes the well-researched relationship between asset specificity and foreign market entry mode choice by introducing knowledge safeguards (international experience, host-country networks, and imitation) and institutional safeguards (property rights protection and cultural proximity) as alternative mechanisms for securing a firm's specific assets.

"This paper examines the effect of government political ideology on internationalization of family controlled firms (FCFs). FCFs tend to internationalize less than non-FCFs, because of their loss aversion and conservative concerns about maintaining the family's socioemotional wealth (SEW). We propose that FCFs' concerns related to internationalization are alleviated when the ideology of government (i.e., the set of values about society's goals) are aligned with FCFs' non-economic objectives (e.g., protecting SEW). Governments that subscribe to socially conservative and family-oriented ideology are viewed as particularly supportive of FCFs, which makes family owners feel safe and protected and more open to venturing into internationalization.

"This paper employs organizational learning theory to examine the short-term effect of past export performance, and internal (management) and external (market) forces on marketing strategy adaptation and current export performance. Results from a survey of over 500 export managers indicate that current-period performance improvement (in terms of performance achievement, export intensity, and performance satisfaction in the current year) is influenced by the firm's commitment to exporting. Further, the authors found that while performance satisfaction feeds performance improvement in the following year, both the previous year's export intensity and export performance achievement produce a negative impact on current-period performance improvement. More importantly, the level of development in the export market facilitates marketing strategy adaptation in the short term, as does export intensity in the previous year. However, satisfaction with previousyear performance negatively influences the degree of distribution adaptation.

The present research demonstrates that countability (how easily a product or service can be counted using simple whole numbers) feeds into value sensitivity and thus moderates the impact of inequity on satisfaction. Across nine experiments, we show that when rewards are less easily counted, the effect of inequity on satisfaction is diminished. Further, this effect is rooted to a mechanism in which less countable rewards shift cognitive focus from value comparison to consumption experience. This research contributes to literature on value sensitivity, comparative thinking, numerical information processing, fairness, and happiness.","['nan', 'PACKAGE SIZE', 'PREFERENCE REVERSALS', 'SEPARATE EVALUATIONS', 'AUTOMATICITY', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'MEDIATION', 'HAPPINESS', 'OPTIONS', 'INCOME', 'JOINT']",['happiness'],"['inequity', 'satisfaction', 'value sensitivity']",0.0,0.0
"Service firms frequently contact customers after a transaction to solicit feedback and assess satisfaction with the service experience. Customers who have an ongoing relationship with a firm may receive satisfaction surveys after many or even most of their service encounters, yielding effects that are likely to be cumulative over time. Yet how these cumulative effects influence customer purchase behavior is not clear. Because satisfaction surveys serve a dual purpose of providing valuable customer feedback and incorporating bidirectional communication into relational marketing strategies, understanding their longer term effects is important. This study examines the influence of recurring posttransaction satisfaction surveys on purchase behavior at the individual customer transaction level using service transaction data and relational contact data spanning 3 years at a large North American automotive dealership. The findings reveal that repeatedly soliciting a customer's feedback may have detrimental cumulative effects on purchase amount and interpurchase time, and the cumulative effects vary with customers' cross purchasing history. Results indicate diminished impact of other individualized direct contacts when a customer also receives a posttransaction satisfaction survey. The authors discuss how companies can use satisfaction surveys as an effective tool within a firm's portfolio of relational communications and minimize detrimental effects over time.","['satisfaction surveys', 'postservice satisfaction', 'service purchase behavior', 'relational communication', 'customer relationship management', 'MARKETING COMMUNICATION', 'SURVEY PARTICIPATION', 'SATISFACTION', 'TRANSACTIONS', 'CUSTOMERS', 'INDUSTRY', 'SERVICE', 'IMPACT']","['satisfaction surveys', 'relational communication', 'satisfaction', 'customers', 'service', 'impact']","['customer purchase behavior', 'customer feedback', 'posttransaction satisfaction']",0.0,0.0
"We develop the concept of factional groups, or those in which members are representatives from a small number of (often just two) social entities. Such groups include many merger integration teams, bilateral task forces, and joint venture teams. We extend theory about group demography by arguing that factional groups possess preexisting faultlines that require a new conception of demographic dissimilarity. We propose that large demographic faultlines between factions engender task conflict, emotional conflict, and behavioral disintegration-which in turn lead to poor performance. We tested our model using data from 71 joint venture management groups. Data gathered in two waves strongly supported our propositions.","['nan', 'INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES', 'TOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL GROUPS', 'INTRAGROUP CONFLICT', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY', 'DIVERSITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'TASK', 'CONSEQUENCES']","['performance', 'behavior', 'task']",['performance'],1.0,0.3333333333333333
"Many companies have made significant investments in socially responsible production practices for their products. Environmentally safe cleaning products, fair trade coffee, and sustainable seafood are just a few examples. In this paper, we conduct a meta-analysis of over 80 published and unpublished research papers across a large number of product categories to better understand differences in willingness to pay (WTP) for socially responsible products. In particular, we are interested in whether the beneficiary of the social responsibility program-humans, animals, or the environment-affects WTP. We use two dependent variables: the percentage premium people are willing to pay and the proportion of respondents who are willing to pay a positive premium. We find that the mean percentage premium is 16.8 percent and that, on average, 60 percent of respondents are willing to pay a positive premium. Importantly, across both dependent measures, we find that WTP is greater for products where the socially responsible element benefits humans (e.g., labor practices) compared to those that benefit the environment. Implications for retailers, manufacturers, and future research are discussed. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"This study explores heterogeneity in how firms have achieved high growth. Using the population of all firms in Sweden with more than 20 employees in existence in 1996 (N = 11,748), we analyzed their development for each year of the previous 10 years (1987 to 1996). From this population of all firms in Sweden, multiple criteria were used to define a sample of high-growth firms (n = 1501). Using 19 different measures of firm growth (such as relative and absolute sales growth, relative and absolute employee growth, organic growth vs. acquisition growth, and the regularity and volatility of growth rates over the 10-year period), we identified seven different types of firm growth patterns. These patterns were related to firm age and size as well as industry affiliation. Implications for research and practice are offered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

"Touch has become an inseparable element of mobile platforms. This study examines the use of different touch features and the impact of these touch gestures on consumer engagement with a mobile shopping app. We focus on three informational touch features that are common among shopping apps: touch to zoom in on a page (zoom-page), to view product details (product-view), and to be directed to outside links (open-webpage). We develop a two-level model that captures (1) consumers' decisions to stay with or leave an app and (2) their use of touch features. Our main results empirically demonstrate the strong explanatory power of informational touch gestures, especially their dwell time, in consumer app browsing decisions, whereas navigational touch gestures do not significantly affect app. stay likelihood. A longer dwell time and early use of zoom-page within a session encourage the stay. Moreover, we observe strong synergy and antergy (negative synergy) among these touch gestures. The cumulative dwell time and temporal progression of touch gestures affect subsequent touch feature usage. Managerially, our results suggest that an early intervention that encourages the use of zoom-page increases app stay likelihood, and marketers may apply our model to quantify the impact of such interventions on consumer browsing decisions at the individual level. The results also shed light on how marketers can infer the stage of the shopping process based on touch gestures (segmentation) and guide consumers through the purchase funnel by promoting the use of zoom-page and product-view. Lastly, the findings provide insights into how marketers can promote the use of open-webpage, which has the lowest baseline usage rate yet is crucial for transactions, based on the synergy among touch gestures and through improving the non-native browsing experience.

"Most of the entrepreneurship literature has addressed the benefits and necessity of using social network ties as opposed to market methods in early venture finance, but it has largely understated the potential limitations and costs of doing so. Specifically, very sparse research has examined the factors that influence entrepreneurs' choice between using networks versus market methods. In this study, we propose a contingent model of network utilization when approaching initial investors, based on the dimensions of human capital of the entrepreneurs. We test this model with primary field survey data from 226 new high-tech ventures in Singapore and Beijing. The results show that high occupational status and relevant industrial work experience are positively associated with the entrepreneurs' propensity to utilize existing networks by enhancing the resourcefulness of their network ties (social capital); however, such influences are alleviated by entrepreneurs' marketing or managerial experience, which increases the entrepreneurs' ability to interact with strangers (an aspect of social competence).","['nan', 'SOCIAL RESOURCES', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'SKILLS', 'STRATEGY', 'CRITERIA', 'OUTCOMES', 'GROWTH', 'FIRMS', 'TIES']",['ties'],[],0,0.0
"Festivals are an important sub-field within event studies which, until recently, have not been studied as separate experiences. A systematic review of the emerging literature on festivals reveals several key characteristics. While festivals are diverse in nature and geographical location, scholarly interest focuses on five main themes: the motivations for organizing, funding and attending festivals; the experiences of festival attendees; the relationship between festivals and their local environments; the economic and sociocultural impacts of festivals; and the management of festivals. Despite growing interest in festivals as research sites, little attention has been afforded to investigating festival processes. In particular, considerations of how festivals are established, and which individuals are involved in their initiation and regular staging, offer opportunities for research. This paper highlights the significant role festivals play within their local communities, including their facilitation of social cohesion and regional identity. Our study reveals that the literature rarely discusses the development of festivals over time and the wider networks in which festivals are embedded. This critical review of festival research identifies various research gaps and directions for future research to develop theory and practical understanding of festivals.","['nan', 'CULTURAL POLITICS', 'MUSIC-FESTIVAL', 'SPECIAL EVENTS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'FOOD', 'SATISFACTION', 'QUALITY', 'WINE', 'SEGMENTATION', 'PERCEPTIONS']",['management'],"['festivals', 'event', 'identity', 'networks']",0.0,0.0

Information technology and the Internet have had a dramatic effect on business operations. Companies are making large investments in e-commerce applications but are hard pressed to evaluate the success of their e-commerce systems. The DeLone & McLean Information Systems Success Model can be adapted to the measurement challenges of the new e-commerce world. The six dimensions of the updated model are a parsimonious framework for organizing the e-commerce success metrics identified in the literature. Two case examples demonstrate how the model can be used to guide the identification and specification of e-commerce success metrics.,"['e-commerce', 'evaluation of information systems', 'information systems success', 'use of information systems', 'user satisfaction', 'value of information technology', 'ELECTRONIC COMMERCE', 'WEB', 'INTERNET', 'ADOPTION', 'CONTEXT', 'IMPACT']","['e commerce', 'information systems success', 'internet']",[],0,0.0
"Entrepreneurship research has identified a number of personal characteristics believed to be instrumental in motivating entrepreneurial behavior. TWO frequently cited personal traits associated with entrepreneurial potential are internal locus of control and innovativeness. Internal locus of control has been one of the most studied psychological traits in entrepreneurship research, while innovative activity is explicit in Schumpeter's description of the entrepreneur. Entrepreneurial traits have been studied extensively in the United States. However, cultural studies and studies in non-U.S. contexts are rave and in most cases limited to comparisons between one or two countries or cultures. Thus the question is raised: do entrepreneurial traits vary systematically across cultures and if so, why? Culture, as the underlying system of values peculiar to a specific group or society, shapes the development of certain personality traits and motivates individuals in a society to engage in behaviors that may not be evident in other societies. Hofstede's (1980) extensive culture study, leading to the development of four culture dimensions, provide a clear articulation of differences between countries in values, beliefs, and work roles. Although Hofstede did not specify the relationship between culture and entrepreneurial activity per se, his culture dimensions are useful in identifying key aspects of culture related to the potential for entrepreneurial behavior. In this paper we offer several hypotheses about the relationship between two of Hofstede's culture dimensions and psychological traits associated with entrepreneurial potential. We expect that an internal locus of control orientation is more prevalent in individualistic cultures than in collectivistic cultures. Likewise. we expect that an innovative orientation is more prevalent in low uncertainty avoidance cultures than in high uncertainty avoidance cultures. However, since neither internal locus of control nor innovativeness alone is sufficient to explain entrepreneurial motivation, we also hypothesize that individuals with both an internal locus of control and innovative orientation should appear more frequently in highly individualistic and low uncertainty cultures. These hypotheses were tested on a sample of over 1,800 responses to a sun ey of third- and fourth-year students at universities in;nine countries. Eighteen items in the survey instrument were used to construct scales for innovativeness and locus of control. Items for the innovativeness scale were adapted from the Jackson Personality Inventory while items used for the locus of control scale were adapted from Rotter's I-E scale. The results of this exploratory study support the proposition that some cultures are more conducive for entrepreneurship than others. In individualistic cultures rye found an increased likelihood of an internal locus of control orientation. There was also support for the hypothesis that an entrepreneurial orientation, defined as internal locus of control combined with innovativeness, is more likely in individualistic, low uncertainty avoidance cultures than in collectivistic, high uncertainty avoidance cultures. Culture, it appears, may condition potential for entrepreneurship!, generating differences across national and regional boundaries. One tentative conclusion is that a supportive national culture will, ceteris paribus, increase the entrepreneurial potential of a country This suggests that in addition to support from political, social, and business leaders, there needs to be a supportive culture to cultivate the mind and character of the potential entrepreneur. To be motivated to act, potential entrepreneurs must perceive themselves as capable and psychologically equipped to face the challenges of a global, competitive marketplace. Business education can play an important role in this regard by providing nor only the technical tools (i.e. accounting, marketing, finance etc.), brit by also helping to reorient individuals toward self reliance. independent action, creativity, and flexible thinking. This study examines only two entrepreneurial traits (innovativeness and internal locus of control) and only one of the many contextual factors (culture) which may explain differences among countries in the raze of new venture formation. Future research should expand this investigation to include other traits associated with entrepreneurial behavior as well as the effect of other contextual factors such as education system, political economy, and stage of economic development.

"The authors conducted a theoretical review of the change readiness literature and identified two major limitations with this work. First, while there is substantial agreement about the key cognitions that underlie change readiness, researchers have not examined the affective element of this attitude. Second, researchers have not adopted a multilevel perspective when considering change readiness. The authors address these limitations and argue that it is important to incorporate affect into definitions of the change readiness construct and also when measuring this construct. They then develop a multilevel framework that identifies the antecedents and consequences of individual, work group, and organizational change readiness. Next, the authors outline the theoretical processes that lead to the development of individual and collective change readiness. They then review theoretical and empirical evidence to identify the antecedents of change readiness at the three levels of analysis. Finally, the authors identify a number of suggestions to guide future research seeking to adopt a multilevel approach to change readiness.","['readiness for change', 'multilevel framework', 'antecedents of change readiness', 'outcomes of change readiness', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'EMPLOYEES COMMITMENT', 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'ATTITUDES', 'CONTEXT', 'IMPACT', 'RESISTANCE', 'BEHAVIOR']","['multilevel framework', 'antecedents of change readiness', 'organizational change', 'antecedents']",[],0,0.0
"E-negotiations, or sales negotiations over email, are increasingly common in business-to-business (B2B) sales, but little is known about selling effectiveness in this medium. This research investigates salespeople's use of influence tactics as textual cues to manage buyers' attention during B2B e-negotiations to win sales contract award. Drawing on studies of attention as a selection heuristic, the authors advance the literature on mechanisms of sales influence by theorizing buyer attention as a key mediating variable between the use of influence tactics and contract award. They use a unique, longitudinal panel spanning more than two years of email communications between buyers and salespeople during B2B sales negotiations to develop a validated corpus of textual cues that are diagnostic of salespeople's influence tactics in e-negotiations. These e-communications data are augmented by salesperson in-depth interviews and survey, archival performance data, and a controlled experimental study with professional salespeople. The obtained results indicate that the concurrent use of compliance or internalization-based tactics as textual cues bolsters buyers' attention and is associated with greater likelihood of contract award. In contrast, concurrent use of compliance and internalization-based tactics is prone to degrade buyer attention and likely to put the salesperson at a disadvantage in closing the contract award.","['business to business', 'buyer attention', 'e-communication', 'linguistic', 'machine learning', 'negotiation', 'selling', 'text analysis', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'INFLUENCE STRATEGIES', 'SALESPERSON INFLUENCE', 'ATTENTION', 'COMMUNICATION', 'SALES', 'VIEW']","['business to business', 'buyer attention', 'e communication', 'negotiation', 'selling', 'attention', 'communication', 'sales', 'view']","['e negotiations', 'sales negotiations', 'influence tactics', 'attention', 'award', 'compliance', 'internalization']",0.14285714285714285,0.1111111111111111

They also comment on the Ohio State studies on leadership, and then discuss the ways in which these many styles overlap with transformational leadership and each other, and issue a call to leadership researchers to collectively develop a new full-range' model of leadership that encompasses and distills what is unique about these various styles. The authors argue that such an integrated full-range model is necessary for research on leadership style to progress.","['nan', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP', 'AUTHENTIC LEADERSHIP', 'SERVANT LEADERSHIP', 'ETHICAL LEADERSHIP', 'INITIATING STRUCTURE', 'TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP', 'SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP', 'SHARED LEADERSHIP']","['transformational leadership', 'authentic leadership', 'servant leadership', 'ethical leadership', 'spiritual leadership']","['spiritual leadership', 'leadership', 'servant leadership', 'transformational leadership', 'model']",0.6,0.6
"Mobile commerce technologies cater to multiple types of users who use them for various purposes in a dynamic fashion over time. Their development and diffusion therefore involves many actors who participate in changing market configurations. In this study we address this complex sociotechnical setting by investigating the biography of mobile text messaging, an instance of mobile commerce technologies, in China. Specifically, we apply an actor-network perspective to understand the development and diffusion of text messaging over time and the changing actor configurations. This analysis was based on 1,403 news items pertaining to the Chinese telecommunications market, which were screened from over 40,000 news items produced over sixteen years. The deduced pattern indicates that the diffusion of text messaging, and possibly other mobile commerce technologies, includes four actor network configurations. Mobile commerce platforms begin to operate within a small network of actors, and via a dynamic process of events and interactions, they end up with a complex network of actors, which can include content and service providers, customers, regulators, and businesses that drive mobile commerce technology diffusion and breadth of uses across markets. The suggested pattern provides a biography of artifacts regarding mobile technologies at the national level.","['Actor-network theory', 'mobile commerce platforms', 'mobile services development and diffusion processes', 'short messaging services', 'USER ACCEPTANCE', 'SERVICES', 'MEDIA']",['mobile commerce platforms'],"['mobile commerce', 'mobile text messaging', 'china']",0.0,0.0
"Many companies are increasingly selling hybrid bundles, which comprise one or more goods and one or more services. Hybrid bundle pricing depends on understanding consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for the bundle, which rests on trade-offs among the benefits from four key drivers: service autonomy, complementarity, service quality variability, and overall bundle quality (basic vs. premium). The effects of these drivers and their interactions on the WTP of hybrid bundles are unknown. The authors develop hypotheses and test them rigorously using incentive-aligned choice-based conjoint and hierarchical Bayesian analysis. The results offer important guidelines for developing appropriate hybrid bundles. If a typical firm under budget constraint has to offer either of two hybrid bundles, one with high complementarity or one with service autonomy, the results suggest that it should offer the bundle with high complementarity. Furthermore, contrary to the conventional wisdom of minimizing service quality variability for premium quality bundles relative to basic quality bundles, the results recommend lowering service quality variability for basic quality bundles but maintaining it for premium bundles.","['Hybrid bundles', 'Conjoint analysis', 'Willingness to pay', 'Service quality', 'MODEL', 'PRODUCTS', 'FAMILIARITY', 'CONSUMERS', 'IMPACT']","['hybrid bundles', 'willingness to pay', 'service quality']","['hybrid bundles', 'willingness to pay', 'complementarity service quality', 'hierarchical bayesian analysis']",0.5,0.6666666666666666

Data were collected from three different sources in a lagged design from 108 teams in a large enterprise in China. Results support the reasoning that transformational leadership promotes team coordination and thereby team performance by encouraging teams to adopt a cooperative, as opposed to competitive, approach to conflict management. These results suggest that transformational leadership may help team members manage conflicts for their mutual benefit. This is an important mechanism through which transformational leadership enhances team coordination and, in turn, achieves higher team performance.","['nan', 'TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE', 'COOPERATIVE GOALS', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY', 'CHINA', 'MODEL', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'INNOVATION', 'VALUES', 'FIELD']","['china', 'model']","['transformational leadership', 'coordination', 'conflict management']",0.0,0.0

"Previous research has portrayed buyer-supplier and supplier-supplier alliances as important mechanisms to foster learning and exchange efficiencies. Controversy remains, however, as to how these alliances interact. While some propose they reinforce one another (e.g. learning in horizontal ties generates positive spillovers to vertical ties), others propose a negative interplay (e.g. when increasing vertical-tie intensity, suppliers may weaken horizontal ties to avoid retaliation from buyers who wish to preserve bargaining power). We empirically test these competing views using survey data from the Brazilian auto-parts industry. In an attempt at reconciliation, we propose that the positive or negative interaction between vertical and horizontal alliances depends on the level of technological uncertainty of goods exchanged. Vertical ties seem to inhibit horizontal ties when technological uncertainty is low; when technological uncertainty is higher, vertical and horizontal ties do not seem to have any meaningful form of interaction. We discuss implications for theory and practice.","['nan', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'NETWORKS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'STRATEGY', 'INDUSTRY', 'PARTNERSHIPS', 'CONTRACTS', 'JAPANESE']",['industry'],"['alliances', 'spillovers', 'power', 'uncertainty']",0.0,0.0

"This article presents the results of a two-study inquiry into a particular type of consumer socialization: the construction of consumer social reality via exposure to television. In study 1, estimates of the prevalence of products and activities associated with an affluent lifestyle were positively related to the total amount of television respondents watched, The amount of television viewing was shown to function as a mediating variable between the demographic variables income and education and the affluence estimates. In study 2, which consisted of student participants who were either very heavy or very light soap opera viewers, heavy viewers again provided higher estimates of the prevalence of the same types of products and behaviors measured in study 1. In addition, heavy soap opera viewers constructed their estimates significantly faster than light viewers, which suggests that relevant information is more accessible in memory for heavy viewers than light viewers, The results are consistent with heuristic processing strategies, particularly the availability heuristic, in which individuals infer prevalence from the ease of retrieval of relevant examples (Tversky and Kahneman 1973).","['nan', 'SOCIAL-REALITY', 'VIOLENCE PROFILE', 'IMAGES', 'CULTIVATION', 'COGNITION', 'TV', 'MATERIALISM', 'AMERICA', 'MODELS', 'MEMORY']","['social reality', 'tv', 'memory']",[],0,0.0

"Research summary: Building on economic geography and institutional theory, we develop and test theory relating geographic variables to the strength of corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement and the cost of equity capital. For a large sample of U.S. firms over the period 1998-2009, we find strong and robust evidence that firms located in areas characterized by high levels of local CSR density score higher in CSR engagement. In addition, firms located close to major cities and financial centers exhibit higher CSR engagement compared to firms located in more remote areas. Moreover, the effect of CSR engagement on reducing equity financing costs is even greater for firms in high CSR density areas than for firms in low CSR density areas.Managerial summary: Does the location of CSR engagement by firms affect the strength of CSR engagement by their neighbors? Does the geography of engagement have an impact on financial performance? Our findings show that a firm's CSR engagement increases in areas where there is dense CSR engagement and when it is located near large cities. In these areas, norms, values, and knowledge related to CSR are transmitted to firms through face-to-face meetings and frequent social interactions with groups such as peers, labor unions, news media, universities, and community organizations, which tend to be concentrated in large cities. Our findings further highlight that CSR engagement reduces equity financing costs for firms in areas where CSR is widely practiced.

"This article reviews 86 studies and uses meta-analytical methods to investigate how perceived corporate social responsibility (CSR) impacts employee attitudes and behaviors and to identify the mediating mechanisms and boundary conditions. An initial review of this body of research finds a multitude of mediators but a limited focus on CSR typology as a potential moderator. Drawing upon social exchange theory, we develop and test two multivariate mediation models to integrate and synthesize three most-studied mediating mechanisms: organizational justice, organizational trust, and organizational identification. Meta-analyses find that while all three mechanisms within the parallel mediation model are equally significant in mediating the effect of perceived CSR on organizational commitment and job satisfaction, organizational identification is superior to organizational justice and organizational trust in mediating the effect of CSR perceptions on organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and turnover intention. It is also found that although both mediation models adequately represent the accumulated empirical data, the sequential model is statistically superior to the parallel model. Although meta-structural equation modeling analyses reveal minimal differences between the broadly defined internal and external CSR perceptions, significant heterogeneity exists between perceived CSR and the outcome variables. The additional analyses suggest that significant differences exist between more specific stakeholder CSR types. In summary, this article extends our understanding of how employees perceive and respond to CSR through multiple sociopsychological mechanisms in additive and sequential fashions and how such responses could differ depending on the specific stakeholder subgroups targeted by CSR. Theoretical contributions and future research directions are also discussed.","['micro-CSR', 'psychological foundations of CSR', 'meta-analysis', 'parallel mediation', 'sequential mediation', 'ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE', 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE', 'EXCHANGE THEORY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'COMMITMENT', 'MANAGEMENT', 'OUTCOMES', 'IMPACT', 'TRUST']","['parallel mediation', 'organizational justice', 'exchange theory', 'identification', 'commitment', 'impact', 'trust']","['corporate social responsibility', 'social exchange', 'organizational justice organizational trust', 'organizational identification', 'perceived csr', 'organizational commitment', 'job satisfaction', 'citizenship behavior', 'turnover intention']",0.0,0.0
"Women's interest and participation in entrepreneurship is growing. The limited and inconclusive findings on such growth have made it difficult to characterize its influence on new venture innovation performance. In addressing this issue, our study found a positive relationship between the gender diversity scores of new venture teams-reflecting the increased presence of women-and the innovation performance of new ventures.

"Mintzberg's and Miles and Snow's configurational theories have both received widespread attention. Most researchers, however, have interpreted these theories in terms of categories of organizations rather than organizational configurations based on ideal types. We explicated the logical structure of configurational theories and developed a set of configurational fit models that are congruent with alternative assumptions of equifinality, which is the premise that multiple organizational forms are equally effective. Then the two theories were formalized with these models and tested empirically. Contrary to our expectations, the results do not support Mintzberg's theory that organizations will be more effective to the extent that they resemble his five ideal types. In contrast with these null results, configurational fit based on Miles and Snow's theory predicted 24 percent of the variance in overall organizational effectiveness.","['nan', 'PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS', 'STRATEGIC TYPES', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'MODEL', 'RELIABILITY', 'SYSTEMS', 'LEVEL', 'MILES']","['model', 'miles']",['equifinality'],0.0,0.0
"Leveraging external sources of knowledge has become a vital element of innovation strategy, especially in emerging markets, where many firms lack the sophisticated knowledge required to innovate. However, extant research in this domain puts little emphasis on emerging economies and also typically treats openness as a firm-level concept. In contrast, this study investigates how individual employees rely on both internal and external knowledge to increase their innovative work output (and, secondarily, their customer acquisition performance) and how their supervising manager's characteristics moderate these mechanisms. Using hierarchical linear modeling of data collected from 123 employees and 50 managers in telecommunications companies in the emerging market of Vietnam, we find support for our hypothesized relationships. These findings have important implications for research and practice as they highlight the role of the individual employee in open innovation, the need for considering a more distributed set of organizational functions, and the relevance for emerging markets.","['Open innovation', 'Microfoundations', 'External knowledge sources', 'Managerial resources', 'Emerging markets', 'Customer acquisition', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'CUSTOMER VALUE', 'TECHNICAL COMPETENCE', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'CONTEXTUAL FACTORS', 'HUMAN SIDE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'SEARCH']","['open innovation', 'emerging markets', 'customer acquisition', 'knowledge', 'performance', 'organization', 'search']","['innovation', 'customer acquisition performance', 'vietnam']",0.0,0.0

"Purpose This study aims to explore the downstream pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) and provides insight to the delivery process of medicines and associated operational inefficiencies. Design/methodology/approach An exploratory, qualitative approach was adopted to examine PSC inefficiency within two European contexts, namely, the UK and Greece. Data was gathered through interviews and a thematic analysis conducted to analyse the data and identify challenges faced by both supply chains(SCs). Findings The medicines delivery system needs to be enhanced in terms of quality, visibility, speed and cost to perform effectively. The findings demonstrated that although the healthcare SCs in the two European contexts have different operational structures, the results are in concordance with each other. Financial, communication, waste and complexity issues were the major concerns. Research limitations/implications To the knowledge this is the first study to examine aspects of the medicines SC via a cross-case analysis in the UK and Greece and extends the body of knowledge. A broader sample of responses is warranted to further validate these findings. Practical implications The study outputs can inform pharmacies' strategic to instigate targeted improvement interventions. The implications of which may be extrapolated further to other European healthcare organisations. Originality/value This research contributes to the academic literature by adding further theoretical insights to SC strategy development, especially those that have been characterised as highly complex. The study identifies four key areas of intervention needed within this SC (in both countries) to promote higher level efficiencies and effectiveness.","['Efficiency', 'Healthcare service', 'Improvement', 'SCM performance', 'Pharmaceutical supply chain', 'Improvement approaches', 'Inefficiencies', 'Healthcare', 'CARE SENSITIVE CONDITIONS', 'HEALTH-CARE', 'LEAN IMPLEMENTATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'RESILIENCE', 'READINESS', 'LOGISTICS', 'SYSTEM', 'NURSE', 'RESPONSIBILITY']","['efficiency', 'improvement', 'pharmaceutical supply chain', 'inefficiencies', 'healthcare', 'system']","['psc inefficiency', 'greece', 'thematic analysis', 'healthcare']",0.25,0.16666666666666666
"Purpose - This paper aims to conceptualize the role of service quality in the manufacturing supply chain, present a scale to measure the same, and a model that proposes that internal and external service quality initiatives lead to loyalty and satisfaction of supplier, which in turn are determinants of competitive advantage and organizational performance of the focal organization. Design/methodology/approach - The research design for this paper includes a combination of literature review, exploratory interviews with scholars and practitioners, and a survey of 156 practitioners in three automobile-manufacturing companies in North India. Structural equation modeling has been used for data analysis. Findings - The paper has developed a scale to measure service quality in the supply chain, and presented a model and set of propositions related to service quality in the supply chain. The model proposes linkages of service quality with loyalty, satisfaction, competitive advantage and organizational performance. The author has empirically tested the model at supplier-manufacturer dyad and found that the data fit the model. Research limitations/implications - Future researchers could validate this scale, and empirically test the proposed model. Insights derived from supplier-manufacturer dyad may be transferred to other dyads of supply chain such as manufacturer-distributor, distributor-retailer, and manufacturer and its own employees. Practical implications - This study would be of interest to manufacturing industry practitioners interested in internal and external service quality improvements. This study finds support for strengthening relationships between a focal organization and its suppliers. Service quality-based business processes can help strengthen business relationships, develop synchronized linkages between supply chain members, and consequently gain competitive advantage. Original/value - There are few empirical studies that measure service quality in manufacturing industries or the supply chain. The role of internal and external service quality and their linkages with loyalty, satisfaction, competitive advantage and organizational performance has previously not been conceptualized.","['Service quality assurance', 'Supply chain management', 'Competitive advantage', 'Organizational performance', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS', 'SCALE DEVELOPMENT', 'CONCEPTUAL-MODEL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'LOYALTY', 'PROFITABILITY', 'REASSESSMENT']","['competitive advantage', 'organizational performance', 'competitive advantage', 'performance', 'loyalty']","['service quality', 'loyalty', 'satisfaction', 'competitive advantage', 'organizational performance']",0.6,0.6
"Agency theory predicts that incentives will align agents' interests with those of principals. However, the resource-based view suggests that to be effective, the incentive to deliver must be paired with the ability to deliver. Using Fortune 500 boards as an empirical context, this study shows that the presence of directors who lack top-level experience but own large shareholdings is negatively associated with firm value, an effect that increases in the number of such directors. Firm value rises after such directors depart from boards, with the greatest increases occurring when many of these directors leave. While agency theory highlights the importance of the right incentives being in place, this research suggests that this can be ineffective if the right resources are not also in place.

"The constructs of perceived control and convenience have been identified in previous qualitative studies of self-service technology (SST) use as important factors; yet empirically their effects are relatively unknown. Based on the theory of planned behavior, this study explores how control and convenience perceptions influence customers' utilitarian (speed of transaction) and hedonic (exploration) motivations for using an SST. In addition, we explore how trust in a service provider influences customers' future SST intentions. Two studies were undertaken to assess both users and nonusers' evaluations of an SST. The results revealed that perceived control and convenience do impact the intentions of customers to use an SST in the future; however, their impact was mediated through the constructs of speed of transaction, exploration, and trust. Increased control and convenience perceptions influenced exploration, trust and speed evaluations, which in turn were associated with stronger perceived value, higher SST satisfaction judgments, and increased SST usage intentions. Managerial implications stemming from the empirical findings are discussed along with directions for future research.","['Self-service technology', 'Control', 'Trust', 'Convenience', 'Exploration', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS', 'ELECTRONIC COMMERCE', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'TRUST', 'QUALITY', 'ACCEPTANCE', 'MODEL', 'INTERNET', 'LOYALTY']","['self service technology', 'control', 'trust', 'convenience', 'exploration', 'technology', 'trust']","['perceived control', 'convenience', 'self service technology', 'trust']",0.75,0.42857142857142855
"Collaborative filtering (CF) techniques are becoming very popular on the Internet and are widely used in several domains to cope with information overload. E-commerce sites use filtering systems to recommend products to customers based on the preferences of like-minded customers, but their systems do not protect user privacy. Because users concerned about privacy may give false information, it is not easy to collect high-quality user data for collaborative filtering, and recommendation systems using poor data produce inaccurate recommendations. This means that privacy measures are key to the success of collecting high-quality data and providing accurate recommendations. This article discusses collaborative filtering with privacy based on both correlation and singular-value decomposition (SVD) and proposes the use of randomized perturbation techniques to protect user privacy while producing reasonably accurate recommendations. Such techniques add randomness to the original data, preventing the data collector (the server) from learning private user data, but this scheme can still provide accurate recommendations. Experiments were conducted with real datasets to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed scheme. The results were used for analysis of how different parameters affect accuracy. Collaborative filtering systems using randomized perturbation techniques were found to provide accurate recommendations while preserving user privacy.","['accuracy', 'collaborative filtering', 'privacy', 'randomized perturbation', 'SVD', 'nan']","['accuracy', 'collaborative filtering', 'privacy', 'randomized perturbation', 'svd']","['collaborative filtering', 'singular value decomposition', 'perturbation']",0.3333333333333333,0.2
"Previous research has provided conflicting arguments and evidence on which corporate governance system-bank based or market based-is better in preventing managers from investing in value-destroying projects. This paper attempts to further the debate by comparing the effect of these different corporate governance systems on preventing capacity expansion bandwagon behavior in the worldwide petrochemical industry in the period 7975-95. Our study shows, first, that neither system is particularly effective in curbing overinvestment; however, the market-based system seems to be less ineffective than the bank-based system. Second, free cash flow appears to drive greater bandwagon behavior in the market-based system than in the bank-based system. Finally, within the bank-based system, companies that rely on one bank-shareholder are more likely to join the bandwagon than those with more than one.

"Like Cinderella, many repurposed products involve a biographical transformation, from a tattered past identity (e.g., an old airbag) to a product with a valuable but different new identity (e.g., a backpack made from an airbag). In this article, the authors argue that marketers should help customers infer such product stories by highlighting the products' tattered past identities. Three field experiments and four controlled experiments show that making a product's past identity salient boosts demand across a variety of repurposed products. This is because past identity salience induces narrative thoughts about these products' biographies, which in turn allows customers to feel special. Results also suggest that this strategy of past identity salience needs to be particularly well-crafted for products with easily discernible past identities. These findings highlight a promising new facet of storytelling (i.e., stories that customers self-infer in response to minimal marketer input); create new opportunities for promoting products with a prior life; and deliver detailed guidance for the largely unexplored, growing market for upcycled and recycled products.","['storytelling', 'narrative thinking', 'repurposed products', 'upcycling', 'recycling', 'felt specialness', 'product history', 'NARRATIVE TRANSPORTATION', 'CONSUMERS', 'CONSUMPTION', 'GREEN', 'GOODS', 'METAANALYSIS', 'POSSESSIONS', 'PERSUASION', 'CONTAGION', 'FASHION']","['storytelling', 'repurposed products']","['cinderella', 'stories', 'narrative', 'biographies', 'storytelling']",0.2,0.5
"Purchase likelihood typically declines as the length of time since the customer's previous purchase (recency) increases. As a result, firms face a recency trap, whereby recency increases for customers who do not purchase in a given period, making it even less likely they will purchase in the next period. Eventually the customer is effectively lost to the firm. We develop and illustrate a modeling approach to target a firm's marketing efforts, keeping in mind the customer's recency state. This requires an empirical model that predicts purchase likelihood as a function of recency and marketing, and a dynamic optimization that prescribes the most profitable way to target customers. In our application we find that customers' purchase likelihoods as well as response to marketing depend on recency. These results are used to show that the targeting of email and direct mail should depend on the customer's recency and that the optimal decision policy enables the average high recency customer, who currently is virtually worthless to the firm, to become profitable.","['Customer relationship management', 'Customer lifetime value', 'Optimization', 'Migration model', 'Customer recency', 'DYNAMIC-PROGRAMMING MODELS', 'ALLOCATION', 'SELECTION', 'BUSINESS', 'MAIL', 'DMLM', 'CLV']","['optimization', 'mail']",['modeling'],0.0,0.0
"Settlement outcomes in patent litigation are modeled as resulting from strategies pursued by firms with their patented technologies. Hypotheses are derived for two types of influences: the use of patents as isolating mechanisms to protect valuable strategic stakes, and their 'defensive' role in obtaining access to external technologies through mutual hold-up. Parameter estimates from a sample selection probit model provide support for the strategic stakes hypotheses, while the evidence for mutual hold-up is inconclusive. Interindustry comparisons show that nonsettlement of patent suits in both research medicines and computers is increased by strategic stakes and, in addition, mutual hold-up appears to play an important role in computer patent suits.

"Using insights from institutional theory, sociology, and entrepreneurship we develop and test a model of the relationship between centralized and decentralized institutions on entrepreneurial activity. We suggest that both decentralized institutions that are socially determined as well as centralized institutions that are designed by governmental authorities are important in promoting firm foundings in the environmental context. In a sample of the U.S. solar energy sector we find that state-sponsored incentives, environmental consumption norms, and norms of family interdependence are related to new firm entry in this sector. Our findings also suggest that the efficacy of state-level policies in the sponsoring of entrepreneurial growth is dependent upon the social norms that prevail in the entrepreneur's environment. We expand entrepreneurship theory and the study of institutions and the natural environment by demonstrating the integral role that social norms play in influencing the creation of new firms and by illustrating the potential effect social norms have on the effect of policy that seeks to encourage environmentally responsible economic activity.

"In this article, we introduce the concept of the service delivery network (SDN) defined as two or more organizations that, in the eyes of the customer, are responsible for the provision of a connected overall service experience. This responds to calls for frameworks recognizing that dyadic service encounters are embedded in the series of experiences customers have with complementary providers as part of the journey to achieve their desired goals. Adopting an SDN perspective presents a dramatically different set of challenges for managers and provides research opportunities challenging the current view of established service concepts. Managers must recognize that to better serve the customer they need to understand the role that they play in the customer-defined service journey and be prepared to coordinate their activities with complementary providers. Participating in helping build and manage the SDN for the customer, or understanding how they fit into customer's self-designed SDN, becomes a central challenge, often requiring firms to develop a new set of capabilities. The SDN also challenges the way we view many of the core concepts in service research, which are anchored in the dyadic view. This provides considerable opportunity for future inquiry. We present a series of research questions, inspired by the SDN, organized into categories including building cooperative and collaborative networks, customer cocreation, systems thinking, customer relationship management, managing service failure and recovery, building capabilities, and customer-to-customer interactions.","['Service delivery network', 'customer journey', 'customer experience', 'service encounter', 'COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS', 'DOMINANT LOGIC', 'EXPERIENCE', 'DESIGN', 'COOPETITION', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'STRATEGIES', 'QUALITY']","['service delivery network', 'service encounter', 'experience', 'design']","['service delivery network', 'customer cocreation systems']",0.5,0.25
"Evolving tastes can change the relative importance of product features in shaping consumers' purchase decisions, which in turn can shift the relative attractiveness of products with different feature levels. The challenge lies in finding a reliable yet cost-effective way to monitor the weights consumers place on various product features. In the context of the U.S. automotive market, the authors explore the potential of using trends in online searches for feature-related keywords as indicators of trends in the relative importance of the corresponding features (e.g., fuel economy, acceleration, cost to buy, cost to operate, body type). By augmenting marketing-mix data with feature search data in a market response model, they show substantial improvements in goodness-of-fit both in and out of sample. The authors find empirical support for the hypothesis that feature search trends are positively correlated with feature importance trends. They discuss how managers may make better decisions by monitoring feature search trends and leveraging those trends strategically.","['Google trends', 'market response model', 'product feature', 'conjoint analysis', 'big data', 'CONSUMER INFORMATION', 'EXTERNAL SEARCH', 'IMPACT', 'INTERNET', 'SALES', 'PRICES', 'CHOICE']","['market response model', 'product feature']","['product features', 'online searches', 'marketing mix', 'market', 'model']",0.0,0.0

"We address the following two questions: how upstream vertical alliance (UVA) activity affects the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); and how SME perceptions of that relationship influence the choice to engage in UVA activity. Using responses from a recent survey of business unit managers representing 200 SMEs, we find that UVA activity benefits SME performance when self-selection effects are controlled. Instead of being a source of differentiation advantages, UVA activity leverages the SME's existing advantages. And, while SME perceptions appear to drive the self-selection of UVA activity, those perceptions are inaccurate; the result is that the SMEs likely to benefit less from such activity engage in it more.

"The current symposium emphasizes that mental health conditions can influence a person's entrepreneurial motives and means. This paper suggests that sleep plays an important role in both. With respect to entrepreneurial motives, I draw from sleep research to suggest that sleep problems may increase entrepreneurial motives by prompting many of the same behaviors as clinical ADHD, and by precipitating and/or mediating the effect of several mental health conditions, including depression. With respect to entrepreneurial means, however, I draw from the same research to suggest that sleep problems are likely to undermine several abilities important for the successful founding of an entrepreneurial venture (alertness, creativity, and social competence). Thus, despite facilitating the desire to become an entrepreneur, sleep problems may undermine an entrepreneur's ability to thrive as an entrepreneur. Overall, the current paper explores the three-way relationship between sleep, mental health, and entrepreneurship, focusing on the important influence of sleep problems on entrepreneurial motives and means. The conclusions integrate existing research and pave the way for new research on the role of sleep in entrepreneurship.","['nan', 'ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'OPPORTUNITY RECOGNITION', 'COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE', 'POSITIVE AFFECT', 'RISK-TAKING', 'DEPRIVATION', 'ALERTNESS', 'ADHD', 'DURATION']","['alertness', 'adhd']","['adhd', 'depression']",0.5,0.5

"Studies have examined how managers use strategy tools, but we know much less about how managers create strategy tools de novo. We undertook an ethnographic study of a business facing a wicked problem and investigated the sociomaterial practice of collective toolmaking. We identify how strategy toolmaking oscillates between different problem domains and reveal how this manifests process affordances, which are 'unintended' by-products of the toolmaking process. Counterintuitively, by intentionally making a strategic tool, actors unintentionally create a sociomaterial springboard for 'spin-off strategizing' and 'the discovery of latent ambiguities', generating strategic value beyond the tool produced. These insights illuminate how the practice of collective toolmaking can stimulate wayfinding, indirectly helping managers to respond to wicked problems, characterized by high degrees of complexity, ambiguity, and indeterminacy.","['affordances', 'strategy-as-practice', 'strategy process', 'strategy toolmaking', 'strategy tools', 'strategy tools-in-use', 'wayfinding', 'AMBIGUITY', 'TOOLS', 'ORGANIZATION', 'RATIONALITY', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'CHALLENGE', 'LANDSCAPE', 'MANAGERS', 'POWER']","['affordances', 'strategy toolmaking', 'strategy tools', 'wayfinding', 'ambiguity', 'tools', 'managers']","['collective toolmaking', 'wayfinding']",0.5,0.14285714285714285
"For a young, resource-constrained, technology-based start-up embarking on international sales, the choice of entry mode is a strategic decision of major importance. Yet within the emerging research stream of international entrepreneurship, curiously little attention has been devoted to the empirical analysis of foreign market entry forms. The authors address this important issue by analyzing the determinants of 398 export decisions taken from a U.K. survey of 246 technology-based start-ups with international activities. The findings show that the entry mode decision is necessarily a trade-off between the resources as available and the support requirements of the customer. Issues of the innovativeness of the technology and the historic channel experience of the firm in its domestic market are particularly strong determinants of mode choice. The authors suggest that an organizational capability perspective on these firms' behavior offers a better explanation of their entry decisions than either transaction cost or stage theory.","['nan', 'TRANSACTION-COST-ANALYSIS', 'MODE', 'VENTURES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FIRMS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'MANAGEMENT']","['mode', 'firms', 'perspective']",[],0,0.0
"Who owns the firm (the state, private ownership, foreign investors) has long been an important topic for research on organizations. This paper estimates how much ownership contributes to firm performance, compared to other factors, including industry, region, firm size, year, and the firm itself. The data are on manufacturing firms in mainland China from 1998 to 2007. We find that the effect of owner type is significant and pervasive across regions and interacts with both geography and time, reflecting China's decentralized system and the strong trend in privatization.

"This paper addresses the effects on corporate restructuring of changing management and ownership. First, it synthesises a number of perspectives on corporate restructuring which involve managerial succession, voluntary restructuring, agency theory, incentives and entrepreneurship, to obtain insights into the relative impact of simultaneously changing either, neither or both management and ownership. Second, it uses case study evidence from management buy-ins to examine the effects of changing both management and ownership. The evidence suggests that whilst management may be adequately incentivized, problems may arise in respect of information asymmetries, difficulties in matching entrepreneurs to the context and monitoring by venture capitalists, and implementation of strategies.","['nan', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'LEVERAGED BUYOUTS', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'CHALLENGES', 'ACQUISITIONS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'FIRMS', 'OUTS']","['entrepreneurship', 'perspective']","['corporate restructuring', 'succession', 'venture capitalists']",0.0,0.0
"Research Summary: This study examines the integration of corporate social responsibility (CSR) criteria in executive compensation, a relatively recent practice in corporate governance. We construct a novel database of CSR contracting and document that CSR contracting has become more prevalent over time. We further find that the adoption of CSR contracting leads to (a) an increase in long-term orientation; (b) an increase in firm value; (c) an increase in social and environmental initiatives; (d) a reduction in emissions; and (e) an increase in green innovations. These findings are consistent with our theoretical arguments predicting that CSR contracting helps direct management's attention to stakeholders that are less salient but financially material to the firm in the long run, thereby enhancing corporate governance. Managerial Summary: This paper examines the effectiveness and implications of integrating environmental and social performance criteria in executive compensation (CSR contracting)-a recent practice in corporate governance that is becoming more and more prevalent. We show that CSR contracting mitigates corporate short-termism and improves business performance. Firms that adopt CSR contracting experience a significant increase in firm value, which foreshadows an increase in long-term operating profits. Furthermore, firms that adopt CSR contracting improve their environmental and social performance, especially with respect to the environment and local communities. Overall, our findings suggest that CSR contracting directs management's attention to stakeholders that are less salient but financially material to the firm in the long run, thereby improving a firm's governance and its impact on society and the natural environment.","['corporate governance', 'corporate social responsibility', 'executive compensation', 'long-term orientation', 'managerial incentives', 'ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE', 'CEO COMPENSATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ORIENTATION', 'REGRESSION', 'IMPACT', 'CONTRACTS', 'DIVERSITY', 'SUBSTANCE', 'RESPONSES']","['corporate governance', 'corporate social responsibility', 'executive compensation', 'long term orientation', 'management', 'orientation', 'impact']","['corporate social responsibility csr', 'executive compensation', 'corporate governance', 'contracting', 'long term orientation', 'performance', 'short termism']",0.42857142857142855,0.42857142857142855
"Extant country-of-origin research has focused on the deliberate use of country-specific associations (CSAs) as a cognitive cue, captured by consumer responses to direct questioning. However, such responses only capture rational and verbally held aspects of CSAs and do not reveal emotional and nonverbally held aspects. Drawing from dual-coding theory, the authors (1) develop propositions about the existence of two distinct types of CSAs (rational and emotional) and the differences in consumers' communication of these associations, (2) apply a three-stage qualitative design in two complementary studies to test these propositions, (3) link the identified CSAs to brand origin recognition and brand ownership, and (4) generate a consumer typology on how CSAs are communicated. Their results indicate that people tend to communicate rational CSAs verbally and emotional CSAs nonverbally. Whereas both rational and emotional associations positively affect consumers' brand origin recognition accuracy, only emotional associations affect brand ownership. The authors consider theoretical and managerial implications in light of recent criticism on country-of-origin research and offer suggestions for further research.","['country-specific associations', 'brand origin recognition', 'dual-coding theory', 'country of origin', 'collage technique', 'SPREADING ACTIVATION THEORY', 'BRAND ORIGIN', 'PROJECTIVE TECHNIQUES', 'MARKET-RESEARCH', 'IMAGE', 'RELIABILITY', 'RELEVANCE', 'GENDER', 'EQUITY', 'NEED']","['country specific associations', 'brand origin recognition', 'dual coding theory', 'country of origin', 'brand origin']","['country of origin', 'country specific associations', 'dual coding theory', 'communication', 'brand origin recognition', 'brand ownership']",0.6666666666666666,0.8
"The paper offers empirical insight into how traditional thinking can continue to dominate contemporary change initiatives, and suggests that the propensity to repackage and sell 'old' management theory as new techniques reflects the persistence of fundamental, insoluble dilemmas in the nature of organizing. Empirical evidence is drawn from a detailed qualitative study of two case study sites at the Royal Mail, the UK postal service. The analysis shows how the two different change initiatives of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and Technical Centres of Excellence (TECEX) are in competition through their methods and discourse, and how this reflects underlying and competing differences in ideologies of management. It vividly demonstrates how contemporary management thinking can involve repackaging old ideas in new rhetoric and a tendency for faddism. Tn organizations such as Royal Mail the consequence is that far from proving to be the solution to organizational problems, die techniques perpetuate a traditional management dualism in strategies of labour management between control and autonomy.","['nan', 'MANAGEMENT', 'CONSTRUCTION']",['management'],[],0,0.0
"We propose that institutions that reduce barriers to entrepreneurship lead to intended consequences, increasing entry rate among individuals facing obstacles to entrepreneurship, such as women. But these regulations also have unintended consequences, decreasing the value appropriated by women who stay in paid employment, as these women lose support of their departing peers. Using an exogenous reduction in entry barriers in Portugal between 2005 and 2009, we find that women launch new ventures at higher rates than men, when entry barriers fall, but the same changes lead to a relative decline in women's wages in paid employment. These effects are amplified for women in managerial positions, who benefit if they leave but lose if they stay. Our study contributes to a nuanced understanding of rent-allocation in firms. Managerial Summary We study the unintended consequences of lowering barriers to entry-an important institutional change to foster entrepreneurship, especially among those facing strongest entry barriers. We examine the effects of such regulations on women departing to entrepreneurship and those staying in incumbent firms, using the registry data from Portugal. The results show that lowering entry barriers leads to higher rates of entrepreneurial entry among women, as intended. But we also find that this deregulation reform results in a wider gender pay gap among those who stay in incumbent firms. We attribute these increases to reductions in bargaining power and productivity, which result from the departure of socially-proximate peers. Finally, these intended and unintended consequences are especially common among female managers-who are more likely to leave for entrepreneurship, on the one hand, but also more likely to witness greater pay gaps in wage work, on the other hand.","['entrepreneurship', 'institutional change', 'gender', 'difference-in-differences', 'regulation', 'RENT APPROPRIATION', 'GENDER INEQUALITY', 'EMPLOYEE MOBILITY', 'SELF-EMPLOYMENT', 'OPPORTUNITY', 'BUSINESS', 'ENTRY', 'POWER', 'MANAGERIAL', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['entrepreneurship', 'institutional change', 'gender', 'regulation', 'entry', 'power', 'managerial']","['barriers', 'entrepreneurship', 'women', 'rent allocation']",0.25,0.14285714285714285
"A cancer diagnosis can mark the beginning of one of the most resource-demanding experiences and traumatic journeys of one's life. Surprisingly, little is known about how consumers assign value, namely valorize, in these complex, extraordinary experiences. Using sociocultural trauma perspectives and a qualitative study of cancer health consumers, we demonstrate that consumers valorize through the (re)construction of trauma memories and use three strategies: metaphorical framing, flesh-witnessing, and commemorating. These enable consumers to construct an enduring life story, to claim authority and knowledge of witnessing trauma, and to honor and preserve meanings and memories. We demonstrate that consumer valorization in a non-hedonic context is fluid, continuous, and embedded in broader sociocultural contexts. These findings contribute to the literatures of value, extraordinary experiences, and trauma.","['Consumer valorization', 'Traumatic experiences', 'Value', 'Cancer journeys', 'Health services', 'Blogging', 'Extraordinary experiences', 'Trauma', 'CHRONIC ILLNESS', 'DOMINANT LOGIC', 'CONSUMPTION', 'CUSTOMER', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'COMMUNITY', 'IDENTITY', 'RESPONSES', 'QUALITY', 'MODEL']","['consumer valorization', 'value', 'extraordinary experiences', 'trauma']",[],0,0.0

"This paper examines the strategies that financial institutions use in order to implement the elimination of financial services. Through 20 in-depth interviews with managers of British banks, insurance companies and building societies, a set of ten alternative elimination strategies was identified. A mail survey (with a stratified random sample of 112 British financial institutions) indicated that the predominant strategy is to eliminate a financial service from new customers, while leaving its existing users unconditionally unaffected. However, the results revealed that the applicability of alternative elimination strategies is situation-specific, since it,varies in relation to the degree of market orientation of a financial institution, to the intensity of market competition, to the austerity of the legislative environment and to the rhythm of technological change.

"Smart products have received increasing attention from researchers and practitioners alike. One limitation of the existing literature, however, is that the term is often used as a blanket term and that there is no consensus on what a smart product actually is. Because different studies rely on differing conceptualizations, the current body of knowledge is scattered and lacks a uniform language and conceptual boundaries. Specifically, existing research has subsumed inherently different products under one collective term, has relied on a multitude of ad hoc criteria to define smart products or has conflated smart products with the services they render and/or the wider ecosystem, in which they operate. These developments limit the systematic advancement of the field and impede the integration of the smart product concept into related concepts such as the Internet of Things. To address these issues, this article provides an extensive analysis of the status quo of the field, with the goal of developing a common language and comprehensive conceptualization of smart products. First, existing studies on smart products were systematically reviewed across contributing disciplines and supplemented with a bibliometric analysis that allowed for a deeper understanding of the smart product concept within and across disciplines. This analysis revealed an initial set of 16 capability-based criteria that are currently applied to conceptualize smart products. Second, based on a systematic coding procedure, these criteria were synthesized and organized within a comprehensive framework delineating four distinct product archetypes for the digital age: (1)Digital, (2)Connected, (3)Responsive,and (4)Intelligent. Third, three major conceptual themes that arise from this framework are identified and possibilities for future research are pointed out. In sum, this work contributes to the literature by improving the understanding of smart products as an epistemic object and by laying the ground for more cumulative research endeavors.","['nan', 'INTELLIGENT PRODUCTS', 'INFORMATION-SYSTEMS', 'RESEARCH THEMES', 'CONSUMER', 'INNOVATION', 'INTERNET', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'THINGS', 'CATEGORIZATION', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['internet', 'things', 'knowledge']",['internet of things'],0.0,0.0
"The authors develop and evaluate a framework for investigating and understanding ethnic product crossover, that is, when a product intended for one ethnic minority group gains significant penetration among consumers outside the referent ethnic group. In three studies, the authors investigate how a product's characteristics, the promotion and distribution decisions made for the product, and consumers' propensity for diversity influence the product's likelihood of crossing over from the intended ethnic target market to mainstream white consumers. Product characteristics interact with both other marketing decisions and consumers' diversity-seeking tendencies to influence whether consumers will be interested in ethnic products and the social context in which they are willing to consume them. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for theory and practice and provide directions for further research that include consideration of the product's ethnic embeddedness, the context in which the product will be consumed, and consumers' diversity-seeking tendencies.","['nan', 'VARIETY-SEEKING', 'SOCIAL-CONTEXT', 'CONSUMPTION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'DISTINCTIVENESS', 'DIVERSITY', 'ATTITUDES', 'IMPACT', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'DETERMINANTS']","['social context', 'diversity']",['diversity'],1.0,0.5
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the link between launch strategy decisions and new product performance. Much of that research focuses on investigating successful launch strategies for innovative, high-technology products. With the rapid growth of information technology as one high-technology sector, in certain industries, network effects occur, which change the competitive game. The existing literature offers little decision making guidance to managers on how to successfully introduce a product that exhibits network effects. The authors discuss the influence of network effects on the dynamics of market competition and on consumers' consumption behaviors. They argue that, because of these changes, the priority of particular performance objectives and the impact of specific launch strategies differ for products that exhibit network effects from what current wisdom and empirical results prescribe. These ideas are formalized in a conceptual framework and a series of research propositions.","['network effects', 'product launch strategy', 'information technology', 'high-tech products', 'MARKET SHARE', 'DEVELOPMENT SUCCESS', 'ENTRY STRATEGY', 'PRICE', 'EXTERNALITIES', 'COMPETITION', 'INDUSTRIAL', 'INNOVATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL']","['network effects', 'information technology', 'competition', 'performance']",['network effects'],1.0,0.25
"Although effective in improving socialization, development, and retention in the US domestic context, mentoring would likely benefit expatriates and their firms, but it remains theoretically underdeveloped in the international context. We develop a theory of international mentoring by integrating current perspectives on protean and boundaryless careers with the literature on mentoring and expatriates. Expatriates need multiple mentors to assist their adjustment and development during the pre-departure, expatriation, and repatriation stages of international assignments. We discuss both hierarchical and peer, and formal and informal, mentoring relationships to delineate which relationships best address specific expatriate needs. International mentoring may improve expatriate adjustment, development, and retention, and thus may affect outcomes of international strategy.

"We theorize how an ideological imprint-ideology formed through past events-serves as an information filter that persistently affects individuals' decision making and how subsequent behaviors of the imprinter-the entity that established the imprint-may alter it. We test our model with a longitudinal dataset of Chinese private entrepreneurs from 1993 to 2012, investigating the influence of a founder's communist ideological imprint, which characterizes foreign capitalism as evil, and subsequent dynamics introduced by the imprinter-the Communist Party-led government of China-on two internationalization strategies that deal with foreign investors and markets: firms' efforts to attract foreign capital and to expand globally. Our findings show that Chinese entrepreneurs' communist ideological imprint negatively affects the internationalization of their ventures, while available and credible information contradicting communism-coming from the government directly, government-created industry social networks for entrepreneurs, or observing governmental support of internationalization-weakens the influence of the imprint.

Furthermore, the underlying cognitive mechanisms in the minds of consumers that trigger the trust advantage remain unexplored.

"Very little systematic research has examined the applicability of strategic management concepts including SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis, industrial organization, resource-based view and core competency, knowledge-based view, Balanced Scorecard and intellectual capital (IC) through the lens of strategic management development in the non-profit context. This paper aims to examine the above concepts in the light of the unique non-profit environment and determine which one is most applicable to social service non-profit organizations (SSNPOs) in the knowledge economy. Based on a review of the development of strategic management with a focus on the above concepts within the non-profit context, this paper argues that the IC concept is more effective compared with the other concepts in the social service non-profit sector. The paper is considered as a starting point and serves as a milestone in applying IC as a strategic management conceptual framework in the social service non-profit sector. It helps to build a nascent body of literature suggesting that IC can be used as a competent strategic management conceptual framework in the social service non-profit sector. A better understanding of the strategic management development in the non-profit context also helps non-profit leaders to appreciate that IC is the most appropriate strategic management concept in SSNPOs. The increased awareness of the IC concept in SSNPOs, as a result of this paper, will probably generate further research from both academic scholars and non-profit practitioners.","['nan', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'BALANCED SCORECARD', 'NON-PROFITS', 'COMPETENCE', 'VOLUNTARY', 'EVOLUTION', 'FUTURE', 'MODEL']","['resource based view', 'balanced scorecard']",['view'],0.0,0.0
"The authors explore product category and customer characteristics that affect consumers' likelihood of engaging in unplanned purchases. In addition, they examine consumer activities that can exacerbate or limit these effects. The authors employ a hierarchical modeling approach to test their hypotheses using a data set of in-store intercept interviews conducted with 2300 consumers across 28 stores. The results show that category characteristics, such as purchase frequency and displays, and customer characteristics, such as household size and gender, affect in-store decision making. Moreover, although the analysis reveals that the baseline probability of an unplanned purchase is 46%, the contextual factors can drive this probability as high as 93%.

"Profit maximization requires that decision makers assess marginal profits. We demonstrate that decision makers often confound marginal profits with changes in average profits (e.g., changes in return-on-investment). This results in systematic deviations from profit maximization where decision makers forgo profit-enhancing investments that reduce average profits or engage in loss-enhancing investments that decrease average losses. In other words, average profit becomes an anchor by which new investments are assessed. We conduct two decision-making experiments that show this bias and demonstrate it is pronounced when average profit data are accessible or task-relevant. Moreover, we find within-subject effects across experiments, which helps demonstrate the mechanism that invokes the bias.

"Parenting has been a central activity throughout human history, yet little research has examined the parental care motivation system on preferences and decision-making. Because successful parenting involves caring for both a child's immediate and long-term needs, we consider whether parenting motivation leads people to focus more on the present or on the future. A series of five experiments reveals that parenting motivation activates gender-specific stereotypes of parental roles, leading men to be more future-focused and women to be more present-focused. These shifts in temporal focus produce gender differences in temporal preferences, as manifested in intertemporal decisions (preferences for smaller, immediate rewards vs. larger, future ones) and attitudes toward a marketplace entity with inherent temporal tradeoffs (i.e., rent-to-own businesses). Reversing gender role stereotypes also reverses these gender differences, suggesting downstream effects of parenting motivation may be due, at least in part, to stereotypes about familial division of labor.","['parenting motivation', 'gender stereotypes', 'intertemporal choice', 'DIVISION-OF-LABOR', 'GENDER-DIFFERENCES', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'SELF-CONTROL', 'MATERNAL SENSITIVITY', 'FUTURE CONSEQUENCES', 'HIERARCHICAL MODEL', 'TIME PERSPECTIVE', 'YOUNG-CHILDREN', 'INFANT']","['parenting motivation', 'division of labor', 'gender differences']",[],0,0.0

"In consumer research, the relationship between memory work and forgetting remains largely unexplored, and the forgetful role that souvenirs can play in remembering is misunderstood, even denigrated. The present study explores the connections between memory work, forgetting, and material culture. Drawing on contemporary material culture studies, it offers a reflection on the memory practices of New Yorkers in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Based on ethnographic research conducted in New York City, it provides evidence that remembering and forgetting can coexist and interconnect in complex ways. Uncovering the mechanics of forgetting in memory practices with souvenirs, it takes the research on memory and material culture beyond the semiotic analysis of signs and symbols, and shows that souvenirs can play a fundamental role in the process of obliterating and/or compartmentalizing aspects of past experiences. Although it may be true that New Yorkers-especially those who personally experienced 9/11-have no need of souvenirs to remember, many of them have memory practices that involve using souvenirs to forget.","['9/11', 'World Trade Center', 'memory work', 'forgetting', 'material culture', 'souvenirs', 'CONSUMPTION', 'POSSESSIONS', 'MEMORIES', 'MEANINGS', 'CULTURE', 'OBJECTS', 'SELF']","['9 11', 'world trade center', 'memory work', 'forgetting', 'material culture', 'souvenirs', 'culture']","['material culture', 'experiences']",0.5,0.14285714285714285

We show that the congruence between individuals' notions of high-perceived control over shopping situations and participative price environments produces an implementation-oriented mind-set that influences cognitions and intentions. In the absence of such congruence, we can independently create implemental mind-sets that replace the natural deliberative thinking of consumers contemplating a purchase.

"Purpose - There has been limited research examining the influence of inter-organisational relationships and the social capital they may nurture in building SCRES. The authors aim to explore how three dimensions of sbcial capital (cognitive, structural and relational) may act as facilitators or enablers. of the four formative capabilities for SCRES (i.e. flexibility, velocity, visibility, and collaboration), identified by Juttner and Maklan. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from three separate tiers of the supply chain involved in the response to an extreme event (the Lambrigg, UK rail crash). Using a social constructionist approach, the paper explores how social capital may enable the emergence of formative capabilities for resilience. Findings - The data suggest that the dimensions of social capital may play an influential role in facilitating the four formative capabilities for SCRES and indicate the potential for these to be mutually reinforcing. Research limitations/implications - The paper provides an illustration of some links between resilience and social capital constructs within one supply network, in the context of crisis response. Different types of network and contexts may result in other outcomes and have other facilitating effects upon SCRES. These findings should be explored within other contexts. Practical implications - The authors highlight that social capital may be nurtured deliberately or emerge as a consequence of relationships within a network. Formal efforts to build network communications, norms of reciprocity may create the conditions for appropriable organisations to emerge when faced with extreme events. Originality/value - Drawing from a social capital perspective, this paper contributes to a fuller understanding of notions of relational capital.","['Risk management', 'Supplier relationships', 'Supply and demand', 'Social factors', 'Supply chain management', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'NETWORK', 'FLEXIBILITY', 'EXPLORATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'CRISIS', 'VIEW']","['network', 'flexibility', 'perspective', 'crisis']","['social capital', 'capabilities', 'resilience']",0.0,0.0
"In this study, the authors assess the effects of a data breach announcement (DBA) by a multichannel retailer on customer behavior. They exploit a natural experiment and use individual customer transaction data from the retailer to conduct a detailed and systematic empirical examination of the effects of a DBA on customer spending and channel migration behavior. To identify the effects, the authors compare the change in customer behavior before and after the DBA between a treatment group (customers whose information is breached) and a control group (customers whose information is not breached) using the difference-in-differences modeling framework. They find that although the data breach results in a significant decrease in customer spending, customers of the firm migrate from the breached to the unbreached channels of the retailer. The findings further reflect that customers with a higher retailer patronage are more forgiving because the negative effects of the DBA are lower for customers with a higher level of patronage. The authors propose andempirically test for the role of customer data vulnerability as the behavioral mechanism that drives customer behavior subsequent to a DBA. The authors offer prescriptions for managers on how to engage with customers following DBAs.","['customer data breach', 'data vulnerability', 'multichannel retailing', 'natural experiment', 'difference-in-differences', 'PRODUCT-HARM CRISIS', 'PROPENSITY SCORE', 'MARKET VALUE', 'IMPACT', 'MANAGEMENT', 'INFORMATION', 'INTERNET', 'NEGATIVITY', 'ADJUSTMENT', 'CHOICE']","['data vulnerability', 'natural experiment', 'difference in differences', 'information']","['data breach', 'customer behavior', 'channel migration', 'differences modeling', 'customer data vulnerability', 'dbas']",0.0,0.0
"Supply chains are made up of distributed, heterogeneous, and autonomous elements in a dynamic relationship with one another. Agricultural supply chains are strictly regulated to ensure food safety and multi-level traceability. Contracts in such chains need sophisticated specification and management of chain agents to ensure auditability. A framework that attacks these problems is proposed. It is centered on three elements that support and manage agent interactions: contracts, coordination plans (i.e., business processes), and regulations (i.e., business rules). The main contributions are (1) a contract model suitable for agricultural supply chains, (2) a negotiation protocol able to produce contracts, and (3) negotiation implementation via Web services. Interoperability among chain processes is fostered by maintaining independence between business processes and contract negotiation.","['agricultural supply chains', 'e-contracting', 'electronic negotiation', 'supply chain management', 'INTEGRATION', 'SERVICES', 'MODEL']","['agricultural supply chains', 'services', 'model']",[],0,0.0
"The world of retailing has changed dramatically in the past decade. The advent of the online channel and new additional digital channels such as mobile channels and social media have changed retail business models, the execution of the retail mix, and shopper behavior. Whereas multi-channel was in vogue in the last decade in retailing, we now observe a move to so-called omni-channel retailing. Omni-channel retailing is taking a broader perspective on channels and how shoppers are influenced and move through channels in their search and buying process. We discuss this development conceptually and subsequently discuss existing research in this multi-channel retailing. We also introduce the articles in this special issue on multi-channel retailing and position these articles in the new omni-channel movement. We end with putting forward a research agenda to further guide future research in this area. (C) 2015 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"This paper investigates linkages between information technology (IT) and firm performance. Although showing recent signs of advance, the existing IT literature still relies heavily on case studies, anecdotes, and consultants' frameworks, with little solid empirical work or synthesis of findings. This paper examines the IT literature, develops an integrative, resource-based theoretical framework, and presents results from a new empirical study in the retail industry. The findings show that ITs alone have not produced sustainable performance advantages in the retail industry, but that some firms have gained advantages by using ITs to leverage intangible, complementary human and business resources such as flexible culture, strategic planning-IT integration,and supplier relationships. The results support the resource-based approach, and help to explain why some firms outperform others using the same ITs, and why successful IT users often fail to sustain IT-based competitive advantages.

Moreover, controlling for self-selection, ventures that relocate to CA or MA subsequently have a greater probability of attracting initial VC compared to ventures that stay in their home state.

"Inter-organizational collaboration has been linked to a range of important outcomes for collaborating organizations. The strategy literature emphasizes the way in which collaboration between organizations results in the sharing of critical resources and facilitates knowledge transfer. The learning literature argues that collaboration not only transfers existing knowledge among organizations, but also facilitates the creation of new knowledge and produce synergistic solutions. Finally, research on networks and interorganizational politics suggests that collaboration can help organizations achieve a more central and influential position in relation to other organizations. While these effects have been identified and discussed at some length, little attention has been paid to the relationship between them and the nature of the collaborations that produce them. In this paper, we present the results of a qualitative study that examines the relationship between the effects of interorganizational collaboration and the nature of the collaborations that produce them. Based on our study of the collaborative activities of a small, nongovernmental organization (NGO) in Palestine over a four-year period, we argue that two dimensions of collaboration - embeddedness and involvement - determine the potential of a collaboration to produce one or more of these effects.","['nan', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'NETWORKS', 'COMPETENCE', 'CONFLICT', 'EMBEDDEDNESS', 'EMERGENCE', 'INDUSTRY', 'SERVICES']","['networks', 'embeddedness']",['networks'],1.0,0.5
"This article represents findings of a PDMA task force studying measures of product development success and failure. This investigation sought to identify all currently used measures, organize them into categories of similar measures that perform roughly the same function, and contrast the measures used by academics and companies to evaluate new product development performance. The authors compared the measures used in over seventy-five published studies of new product development to those surveyed companies say they use. The concept of product development success has many dimensions and each may be measured in a variety of ways. Firms generally use about four measures from two different categories in determining product development success. Academics and managers tend to focus on rather different sets of product development success/failure measures. Academics tend to investigate product development performance at the firm level, whereas managers currently measure, and indicate that they want to understand more completely, individual product success.","['nan', 'INDUSTRIAL FIRMS', 'STRATEGIES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'IMPACT', 'PROJECTS', 'NEWPROD', 'WINNERS']",['performance'],['success'],0.0,0.0
"This study addresses two important global trends: protection of public goods, specifically the environment, and the emergence of multiethnic societies with influential minority groups. The study tests the effect of a government proenvironmental demarketing campaign on the deconsumption behavior of minority groups and the majority population. It suggests that minority consumers use consumption or deconsumption to manifest their social identity, beliefs, and goals as minorities in relation to the majority and that their motivation to respond positively to a government's demarketing campaign is shaped by their national attachment levels. The study was conducted in Jerusalem, Israel, and involved a large data set (N = 66,272) containing household-level data on actual behavior of consumers. The studied groups involved the majority of non-ultra-Orthodox Jews and three minority groups: Israeli Arabs, ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Jewish Russian immigrants. The findings show that in a proenvironmental context, government demarketing is more effective on the majority group than on any of the three minority groups. In addition, minority groups with lower national attachment levels respond more negatively to the demarketing effort. However, higher education levels lead to a more positive response across the majority and minority groups. A central implication of the findings is related to the benefits derived from demarketing for different consumer groups (majorities versus minorities based on religion, ethnicity, and immigration status). The findings also provide a benchmark for demarketing efforts in an environmental context. Finally, they suggest that policy makers and marketers should consider using demarketing more to complement regulatory and economic tools.","['demarketing', 'minority groups', 'national attachment', 'public goods', 'public policy', 'environmental behavior', 'CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTALISM', 'CONSUMER ACCULTURATION', 'MARKETING-STRATEGY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'SELF', 'IDENTITY', 'ISRAEL', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'WATER', 'DISTINCTIVENESS']","['demarketing', 'minority groups', 'national attachment', 'public goods', 'behavior', 'identity', 'israel']","['minority groups', 'demarketing', 'levels']",0.6666666666666666,0.2857142857142857
"Nonmarket organizations play a supportive role in knowledge transfer and innovation domestically, but national differences between them can create barriers to cross-border knowledge transfer. Internationally oriented nonmarket organizationsones that develop international ties and partnershipsmay generate commonalities among participants and promote a set of similar rules, expectations, and norms across different countries and thus may be effective in supporting cross-border knowledge transfer and innovation. We focus on one such kind of organization, the intergovernmental organization (IGO), as a country's connectedness to learning-oriented IGOs may have a positive influence on national innovation. Using an illustrative caselet on one IGO, the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, and an empirical analysis spanning 83 countries from 1996 to 2006, we find that the extent of connectedness to the learning-oriented IGO network enables national innovation. But countries differ in the extent to which they can leverage external knowledge for innovation because of the variation in relationships among local constituencies.","['nonmarket organizations', 'intergovernmental organizations', 'national innovation', 'globalization', 'cross-border knowledge transfer', 'FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER', 'MARKET ECONOMIES', 'PROPERTY-RIGHTS', 'CAPITALISM', 'VARIETIES', 'INSTITUTIONS', 'TRADE']","['nonmarket organizations', 'national innovation', 'cross border knowledge transfer']","['nonmarket organizations', 'knowledge transfer', 'innovation', 'sequestration']",0.25,0.3333333333333333
"For most forms of conscious consumer choice, product attributes serve as the means that consumers use to accomplish their goals. Because there is competition between products in the marketplace, consumption decisions typically present conflict between means to achieve a goal. In this article, we examine the consequences of conflict between regulatory means on consumers' decisions and show that its resolution depends on whether the means-that is, the attributes-are compatible with the consumer's regulatory orientation. We show that compatibility with more than one attribute arouses acute decision conflict and evokes decision processes that result in a pronounced tendency to make counternormative choices. We also show that incompatibility with a product's attributes leads to choosing extreme alternatives, which suggests the presence of a pick-your-poison effect. We test our hypotheses using the attraction, compromise, and deferral paradigms. We close by discussing our results in the context of the Lewinian view of decision conflict.","['nan', 'REGULATORY FIT', 'CONSUMER CHOICE', 'DECISION', 'PERSUASION', 'COMPROMISE', 'CONTEXT', 'ALTERNATIVES', 'ATTRACTION', 'PREVENTION', 'PREFERENCE']","['consumer choice', 'decision', 'compromise', 'context', 'alternatives', 'attraction']",[],0,0.0
"The resource-based view; (RBV) is one of the most widely accepted theories of strategic management. However, to date no systematic assessment of the RBV's level of empirical support has been conducted. In response, a sample of RBV-grounded empirical articles was analyzed from which it was found that the RBV has received only modest support overall and that this support varies considerably with the independent variable and theoretical approach employed. It is therefore suggested that scholars avoid the tendency to test models reflecting early incarnations of the RBV and instead test those that incorporate its more contemporary theoretical extensions.

"Despite the positive societal implications of corporate social responsibility (CSR), there remains an extensive debate regarding its consequences for firm shareholders. This study posits that marketing capability plays a complementary role in the CSR-shareholder wealth relationship. It further argues that the influence of marketing capability will be higher for CSR types with verifiable benefits to firm stakeholders (i.e., consumers, employees, channel partners, and regulators). An analysis utilizing secondary information for a large sample of 1,725 firms for the years 2000-2009 indicates that the effects of overallCSRefforts on stock returns and idiosyncratic risk are not significant on their own but only become so in the presence of marketing capability. Furthermore, the results reveal that although marketing capability has positive interaction effects with verifiable CSR efforts-environment (e.g., using clean energy), products (e.g., providing to economically disadvantaged), diversity (e.g., pursuing diversity in top management), corporate governance (e.g., limiting board compensation), and employees (e.g., supporting unions)-on stock returns (and negative interaction effects with these CSR efforts on idiosyncratic risk), it has no significant interaction effect with community-based efforts (e.g., charitable giving).","['corporate social responsibility', 'marketing capability', 'stock returns', 'idiosyncratic risk', 'CONSUMER PRODUCT RESPONSES', 'HIGH-TECHNOLOGY MARKETS', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'FIRM VALUE', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'STOCK RETURNS', 'RISK', 'PHILANTHROPY', 'ORIENTATION']","['corporate social responsibility', 'marketing capability', 'stock returns', 'idiosyncratic risk', 'stock returns', 'risk']","['corporate social responsibility', 'marketing capability', 'secondary information', 'stock returns', 'idiosyncratic risk', 'corporate governance']",0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666

"This research shows that consumers select a different product when they look down versus up. Because (1) people are accustomed to looking down to process nearby stimuli and to looking up to process distant stimuli, and because (2) perceived distance is linked to concrete versus abstract processing, the association between moving one's eyes or head down or up and concrete versus abstract processing has become overly generalized. A series of three experiments highlights that downward (upward) head and eye movements evoke more concrete (abstract) processing because downward (upward) head or eye movements have come to serve as a proximity (distance) cue. Two additional experiments indicate downstream behavioral consequences of moving one's eyes or head down versus up. Consumers choose more for feasible versus desirable products when looking down and vice versa when looking up. They also tend to be more preference-consistent when looking down versus up.","['nan', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE', 'MENTAL REPRESENTATION', 'CONCEPTUAL SCOPE', 'EYE-MOVEMENTS', 'ATTITUDE', 'CATEGORIZATION', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DESIRABILITY', 'SIMILARITY', 'MEDIATION']","['eye movements', 'consequences']",[],0,0.0
"Research summary: Building on the problem-solving perspective, we study behaviors related to projects and the communication-based antecedents of such behaviors in the free open-source software (FOSS) community. We examine two kinds of problem/project-behaviors: Individuals can set up projects around the formulation of new problems or join existing projects and define and/or work on subproblems within an existing problem. The choice between these two behaviors is influenced by the mode of communication. A communication mode with little a priori structure is the best mode for communicating about new problems (i.e., formulating a problem); empirically, it is associated with project launching behaviors. In contrast, more structured communication fits subproblems better and is related to project joining behaviors. Our hypotheses derive support from data from the FOSS community.Managerial summary: We study how the way in which individuals communicate influence the project-behaviors they engage in. We find that relatively unstructured communication is associated with the setting up new projects, while communication that is structured around an artifact is associated with joining projects. Our findings hold implications for understanding how management may influence project behaviors and problem-solving: Firms that need to concentrate on more incremental problem-solving efforts (e.g., because a sufficient number of attractive problems have already been defined) should create environments in which interaction is undertaken mainly via artifacts. On the other hand, if firms seek to generate new problems (e.g., new strategic opportunities), they should create environments in which open-ended, verbal conversation is relatively more important than artifact-based communication.

"Getting the price right is essential for successful new product introductions. An accurate estimate of consumers' willingness to pay is a crucial part of this task. Measurement of willingness to pay for innovations, however, often yields biased results. In this paper, we investigate consumer-related characteristics and motives that might underlie this bias. Drawing on the elaboration likelihood model, we develop a conceptual model to identify consumer characteristics relevant for preference measurement for innovative products. In doing so, two main factors that potentially influence hypothetical bias are distinguished: ability and motivation. Our conceptual discussion and empirical results demonstrate that the validity of willingness to pay statements is higher among consumers who show a high ability to assess the new product's utility and who are truly interested in purchasing the new product. Counter to intuition, willingness to pay statements from innovators, consumers with good product category knowledge, or consumers who perceive the new product to be highly innovative are relatively more biased and should be interpreted with caution. This research is among the first to look at consumer characteristics rather than methodological issues when it comes to measuring consumer willingness to pay for innovative products. Our conceptual discussion and empirical examination of the drivers of hypothetical bias can be used to refine the validity of the results of the direct willingness to pay approach. These findings should help improve new product pricing surveys and open new avenues for research in measuring consumer preferences.","['nan', 'CONTINGENT VALUATION', 'SUCCESS FACTORS', 'MARKET SHARE', 'PREFERENCE', 'REPRESENTATIONS', 'DIMENSIONS', 'PARADIGM', 'VALIDITY', 'UTILITY', 'USERS']","['preference', 'validity', 'utility']","['innovations', 'elaboration likelihood model', 'intuition']",0.0,0.0

Specifically, through the purposeful use of labels, rhetoric and narratives, self-categorization enables subsidiaries to strategically position themselves vis-a-vis both regulators and local incumbents, thereby exercising agency to influence the nonmarket environment in their preferred direction.

"The construct of feeling trusted reflects the perception that another party is willing to accept vulnerability to one's actions. Although this construct has received far less attention than trusting, the consensus is that believing their supervisors trust them has benefits for employees' job performance. Our study challenges that consensus by arguing that feeling trusted can be exhausting for employees. Drawing on Stevan Hobfoll's conservation of resources theory, we develop a model in which feeling trusted fills an employee with pride a benefit for exhaustion and performance while also increasing perceived workload and concerns about reputation maintenance burdens for exhaustion and performance. We test our model in a field study using a sample of public transit bus drivers in London, England. Our results suggest that feeling trusted is a double-edged sword for job performance, bringing with it both benefits and burdens.

"Because consumers ask different questions to establish commitment at beginning versus advanced stages of goal pursuit, we propose that progress that they attribute to themselves and to the situation will have a distinctive impact on motivation, depending on their relative position in goal pursuit. When progress on achieving a goal is low, people are concerned about its attainability. Because attributing low progress to self (vs. to the situation) signals a higher difficulty of goal attainment, it leads to lower goal commitment and, subsequently, decreased motivation. Conversely, when progress on achieving the goal is high and attainment of the goal is relatively secured, people are more concerned about the value of the goal. Because attributing a high progress to self (vs. to the situation) signals a greater value of the goal, it should lead to greater goal commitment and, subsequently, higher motivation.","['nan', 'GRADIENT HYPOTHESIS', 'REGULATORY FOCUS', 'CHOICE', 'EXPECTANCY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'SELF']",['self'],[],0,0.0

In support of our hypotheses, we identify fully mediated relationships from procedural, interactional, and distributive justice to external representation and internal influence via job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Our results generally support our expectation that the indirect effects of procedural justice on external representation and internal influence are stronger than the indirect effects of distributive or interactional justice on these behaviors. Also, our results reveal no significant indirect effects of procedural and distributive justice on service delivery behaviors. However, we find an unexpected direct positive path from interactional justice to service delivery behaviors. We interpret this latter finding in light of the normative value of interactional justice as a source of role modeling or managerial legitimacy. (c) 2005 New York University.

"Whether or not to adopt and how extensively to use a newly legitimized practice are discrete decisions made by firms undergoing institutional change. The aim of this paper is to identify the distinct effects of economic, social, and political factors on the adoption of performance-related pay practices and their coverage (i.e. the proportion of employees covered by the practices) by integrating institutional and agency theories. An empirical analysis is performed with a unique sample of Korean firms that experienced the East Asian financial crisis of 1997. The results show that while performance-related pay adoption was influenced by economic and social factors, performance-related pay coverage was related to political factors as well as economic and social factors. This finding suggests that while firms adopt performance-related pay practices in search of legitimacy, they do not blindly imitate such practices but rather proactively adapt them based on economic efficiency considerations. This study makes valuable contributions to research on institutionalism and remuneration by empirically identifying the conditions under which a pay practice adopted for social legitimacy fits or fails to fit the economic needs of the adopters.","['nan', 'HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'FORMAL-STRUCTURE', 'RISK', 'DETERMINANTS', 'IMPACT', 'FIRMS', 'DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION', 'GLOBALIZATION']",['firms'],['legitimacy'],0.0,0.0
"Based on the job-crafting perspective, we theorized a serial curvilinear mediated moderation model that links underemployment to two outcomes that benefit the organization: creativity and organizational citizenship behavior. A three-waved time-lagged survey of teachers and a field study of technical workers provided convergent support for this model. In Study 1, using data from 327 teachers and their immediate supervisors, we found support for our hypotheses that perceived underemployment had an inverted U-shaped relationship with task crafting and that this relationship was moderated by organizational identification. When the teachers' organizational identification was high, they engaged in more task crafting for the organization at intermediate levels of perceived underemployment. We also found that task crafting was positively related to creativity and organizational citizenship behavior. In Study 2, the simulation tasks for 297 technical workers provided convergent evidence for the idea that objective underemployment indirectly influences objective task crafting through perceived underemployment with the inverted U-shaped path from perceived underemployment to task crafting. We discussed the theoretical and practical implications of this research.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'POTENTIALLY BAD SITUATION', 'PERCEIVED OVERQUALIFICATION', 'EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY', 'JOB-SATISFACTION', 'TEAM PERFORMANCE', 'WORK', 'MEDIATION', 'OUTCOMES', 'VOICE']","['organizational citizenship behavior', 'work', 'outcomes']","['job crafting', 'creativity', 'organizational citizenship behavior', 'organizational identification']",0.25,0.3333333333333333
"Leaders are often thought to meaningfully influence the performance of the organizations they lead. However, considerable research suggests that their impact on organizational performance might actually be minimal. These claims of leader irrelevance pose a puzzle: If leaders are relatively insignificant, why would someone commit to leading? Applying decision-making theory, I first consider justifying the decision to lead according to the logics of consequence and appropriateness-the two principal decision-making logics underlying previous work on the motivation to lead. I then present the logic of absurdity-a decision-making logic in which decision makers knowingly choose to dedicate themselves to an irrational course of action. In terms of the decision to lead, a decision maker employing the logic of absurdity acknowledges the likely futility of leading but decides to commit to it nonetheless. I conclude by considering when leaders are most likely to decide to lead according to the logic of absurdity and why doing so may result in leadership of exceptional originality, foolishness, intelligence, and madness.","['nan', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'METAANALYTIC TEST', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'MOTIVATION', 'IDENTITY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'OPTIMISM']","['motivation', 'performance']",[],0,0.0
"Speed of internationalization is a multidimensional concept with performance consequences, but little is known about the interrelatedness between different time-related concepts. The authors address this deficiency by developing three hypotheses, which are confronted with a data set collected on site at 203 small and medium-sized enterprises. The analysis reveals that (1) the longer the time to internationalization, the lower the speed of international expansion; (2) the earlier the point in time when internationalization starts, the lower the speed of international expansion; and (3) there is an antagonistic interaction effect revealing that the negative effect on the speed of international expansion caused by a longer time to internationalization is moderated by the point in time when internationalization starts. The study contributes to theory by examining the interrelatedness between temporal concepts in the internationalization literature and by showing how the underlying mechanisms influencing internationalization speed change over time. For managers, insights into the importance of time and temporality for successful international expansion are provided.","['speed of international expansion', 'time to internationalization', 'point in time when internationalization starts', 'temporality', 'small and medium-sized enterprises', 'BORN-GLOBAL FIRMS', 'ACCELERATED INTERNATIONALIZATION', 'CAPABILITIES PERSPECTIVE', 'EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL', 'VENTURES', 'ENTRY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PATTERNS', 'INTENSITY']","['speed of international expansion', 'time to internationalization', 'point in time when internationalization starts', 'temporality', 'small and medium sized enterprises', 'performance']","['speed', 'performance', 'international expansion']",0.3333333333333333,0.16666666666666666
"Some scholars have suggested recently that a market-oriented culture leads to superior performance, at least in part, because of the new products that are developed and are brought to market. Others have reinforced this wisdom by revealing that a market-oriented culture enhances organizational innovativeness and new product success, both of which in turn improve organizational performance. These scholars do not reveal, however, through which new product development (NPD) activities a market-oriented culture is converted into superior performance. To determine how critical NPD activities are for a market-oriented firm to achieve superior performance, our study uses data from 126 firms in The Netherlands to investigate the structural relationships among market orientation, new product advantage, the proficiency in new product launch activities, new product performance, and organizational performance. We focus on product advantage-because product benefits typically form the compelling reasons for customers to buy the new product-and on the launch proficiency-as the launch stage represents the most costly and risk, v part of the NPD process. Focusing on the launch stage also is relevant because it is only during the launch that it will become evident whether a market orientation has crystallized into a superior product in the eyes of the customer. The results provide evidence that a market orientation is related positively to product advantage and to the proficiency in market testing, launch budgeting, launch strategy, and launch tactics. Product advantage and the proficiency in launch tactics are related positively to new product performance, which itself is related positively to organizational performance. Market orientation has no direct relationship to new product performance and to organizational performance. An important implication of our study is that the impact of a market orientation on organizational performance is channeled through the effects of a market orientation on product advantage and launch proficiency; subsequently through the effects of product advantage and the proficiency in launch tactics on new product performance; and finally through the effect of new product performance on organizational performance. These channeling effects are much more subtle and complex than the direct relationship of market orientation on organizational performance previously assumed. Another implication of our study is that the impact of a market orientation on performance occurs through the launch activities rather than being pervasive to all organizational processes and activities. A reason for this finding may be that NPD is the one element of the marketing mix that predominantly is the responsibility of the firm, whereas promotion and distribution often are in control of organizations outside the firm (e.g., advertising agencies, major retailers) and whereas the channel or the market often dictates the price. Both implications provide ample opportunities for further research on market orientation and NPD.","['nan', 'STRATEGIC ORIENTATION', 'DEVELOPMENT SUCCESS', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'INNOVATION', 'JAPANESE', 'FAILURE', 'MODEL', 'FIRM', 'DETERMINANTS', 'ANTECEDENTS']",['firm'],['market orientation'],0.0,0.0
"This article examines the determinants of success in self-employment, with a focus on the effects of the time spent caring for children. Many public policies are designed to encourage self-employment, especially among women. In addition, it has been argued that one of the reasons individuals, and women in particular, choose self-employment over wage and salary sector employment is to spend more time with their children. The effect of time spent with children on the probability of continuing in self-employment has not been studied in previous work, however. This study analyzes spells of self-employment among workers in eight European nations. Using data from the European Community Household Panel survey for 1994-1999, we estimate the effect of time spent caring for children on the duration of self-employment, controlling for other factors that affect self-employment success rates. The estimates indicate that caring for children significantly reduces the duration of self-employment ventures, for both males and females, and in most countries studied. The results suggest that policy makers need to consider child care policies in conjunction with self-employment policies.","['nan', 'TIME', 'WOMEN', 'MEN', 'ENTREPRENEURS', 'HOUSEWORK', 'SURVIVAL', 'DYNAMICS', 'CREATION', 'PARENTS', 'GENDER']","['time', 'women', 'men']","['self employment', 'women']",0.5,0.3333333333333333
"User toolkits for innovation were recently proposed as a means to eliminate (costly) exchange of need-related information between users and manufactures in the product development process. The method transfers certain development tasks to users and thereby empowers them to create their own desired product features. This article examines the implications of different levels of opportunities for consumer involvement (OCI) in product development to learn what happens when firms pass design tasks on to consumers. It explores this issue by studying the relation between the employment of user toolkits and the need for firms to support their consumers. An analysis of 78 computer games products and the amount of support given by firms to the consumers of these products suggests that a share of the costs firms save on information acquisition by letting consumers do it themselves may eventually reemerge as costs in consumer support. In other words, an increase in opportunities for consumer involvement seems to increase the need for supporting consumers. A promising solution to the problem of support costs is identified, namely, the establishment of consumer-consumer support interaction. A case study of an outlier in terms of firm support to consumers-Westwood Studios-shows that consumers who use toolkits may be willing to support each other. Such interactive problem solving in a firm-established user community is advantageous to the firm, because the process reduces the amount of resources that the firm itself needs to dedicate to the support of consumers using toolkits. Generally, consumer-to-consumer interaction can facilitate problem-solving in the consumer domain, can aid the diffusion of toolkit related knowledge, and potentially can enhance the outcomes produced by the toolkit approach.","['nan', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'INFORMATION', 'COMPLAINTS', 'FIRM']","['product development', 'information', 'firm']",['involvement'],0.0,0.0
"In many industries, for-profit business organizations make decisions that critically impact the safety of their employees and the public. Managers in such organizations often argue that there is no trade-off between profitability and safety because safety is good business. However, prior studies examining the profitability-safety relationship report inconsistent and conflicting results. In the present study, the author reexamines this issue, building on insights into managerial risk taking from the behavioral theory of the firm and hypothesizing that the slope of the profitability-safety relationship reaches an inflection point at the organizational profitability aspiration. Using data from the U.

"Liability of foreignness, a firm's social and economic costs of operating in a foreign market, is a major concern for multinational corporations and firms trying to enter new markets. To reduce the liability of foreignness, a firm may engage in strategic international political management via foreign political connections and thus lower barriers to entry. Faccio (Am Econ Rev 96(1):369-386, 2006) suggests that political connections can be established by having large shareholders, who are politicians or are politically connected. This paper investigates the value of such foreign political connections for publicly listed firms. We find that foreign political connections create large firm value and improve access to foreign markets. One of the main channels of value creation is government contracts awarded to firms with direct foreign political connections. Our findings provide evidence of the effectiveness of having large and active foreign politically connected shareholders as part of a firm's international political corporate strategy.","['foreign political connection', 'shareholder value', 'government contracts', 'strategic political management', 'liability of foreignness', 'CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS', 'FIRM']","['foreign political connection', 'government contracts', 'liability of foreignness', 'firm']","['foreign political connections', 'government contracts']",0.5,0.25

"Chief executive officer (CEO) narcissism is an important area of research due to the strategic implications of how this multifaceted personality trait affects CEO behavior. This article presents a combined meta-analytic and narrative review of CEO narcissism and makes future research recommendations. Our review and meta-analytic findings lead to the creation of a framework for CEO narcissism research focused on narcissistic CEO supply, demand, behavior, and consequences. Additionally, our review identifies five methods of measuring CEO narcissism, each with strengths and weaknesses. We find that while extant findings exhibit common themes, such findings remain mixed and potentially dependent upon methods. We recommend that future research expand beyond the strategic consequences of CEO narcissism to consider additional foci of the research framework and its moderators. Additionally, we suggest that research can benefit from moving beyond the predominant theoretical lenses of upper echelons theory and leadership theory to the lenses of the extended agency model of narcissism, the admiration-versus-rivalry perspective of narcissism, and tournament theory.","['CEO narcissism', 'executive narcissism', 'narcissism', 'chief executive officer', 'personality', 'leadership', 'meta-analysis', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'PERSONALITY-INVENTORY', 'GRANDIOSE NARCISSISM', 'DARK-SIDE', 'SELF', 'LEADERSHIP', 'PERFORMANCE', 'BRIGHT', 'OVERCONFIDENCE', 'MATERIALISM']","['ceo narcissism', 'narcissism', 'chief executive officer', 'personality', 'leadership', 'leadership']","['ceo narcissism', 'upper echelons', 'extended agency model']",0.3333333333333333,0.16666666666666666
"Purpose - The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review to understand the state of the art of partnerships between humanitarian organizations and business corporations in managing humanitarian logistics. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic literature review is conducted based on the steps proposed by Denyer and Tranfield (2009). The context-intervention-mechanism-outcome (CIMO) logic is applied to identify the state of the art of partnerships between humanitarian organizations and business corporations in humanitarian logistics. Thirty-six papers related to the topic are extracted from recognized journal databases and then classified into four categories based on the CIMO logic: situational context, intervention factors, mechanisms and outcomes. Findings - The study shows that while the context and mechanisms for developing cross-sector partnerships between the humanitarian and the business sector have been examined and illuminated by many researchers, additional research (in particular, empirical studies) is needed to measure outcomes as well as the contributions of partnerships to the performance of humanitarian logistics. In addition to synthesizing the literature in this area, this study also presents challenges of such partnerships. Practical implications - The study improves the understanding of the state of cross-sector partnerships in humanitarian logistics as well as identifies opportunities for future research in this area. The study provides reasons and motives of initiating humanitarian-business partnerships in humanitarian logistics as well as their mechanisms and potential outcomes. This may help in developing successful logistics partnerships with each other. Originality/value - This is the first systematic literature review to examine the nature of partnerships between humanitarian organizations and business corporations in humanitarian logistics using CIMO logic.","['Partnership', 'Humanitarian logistics', 'Humanitarian relief', 'SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT', 'DISASTER RELIEF', 'OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT', 'SERVICE PROVIDERS', 'AID', 'LESSONS', 'SUPPORT', 'COORDINATION', 'CHALLENGES', 'SYSTEMS']","['partnership', 'humanitarian logistics', 'challenges']","['systematic literature review', 'systematic literature review']",0.0,0.0
"Drawing from the attention-based view of the firm, this study adds to research on the entrepreneurial process of early and rapid internationalization by investigating the mediating role of international learning effort in the relationship between international young ventures' entrepreneurial strategic posture and international performance and explores how external and internal factors might moderate this role. Using data from international young ventures based in China, the authors show that an entrepreneurial strategic posture enhances international performance through the intensity of learning efforts expended in foreign markets. Furthermore, the findings reveal that this mediating effect of international learning effort is more pronounced at higher levels of external competitive intensity and intra firm social interaction. This study has great significance for the increasing body of research on international new ventures in that it reveals a critical behavioral mechanism that underpins the learning advantages of these ventures.","['international young ventures', 'attention-based view', 'international learning effort', 'entrepreneurial strategic posture', 'emerging markets', 'BORN GLOBAL FIRM', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'CAPABILITIES', 'ORIENTATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'EXPANSION', 'VENTURES']","['international young ventures', 'attention based view', 'international learning effort', 'entrepreneurial strategic posture', 'mediating role', 'ventures']","['attention based view', 'international learning effort', 'international young ventures entrepreneurial strategic posture', 'international performance']",0.5,0.3333333333333333
"Over the last decade, the international business literature has placed ever-greater emphasis on the role that learning and innovation play in determining multinational and multinational subsidiary performance. The present research seeks to understand the organizational paths leading to such desirable outcomes as greater learning, increased innovation and improved performance. Using a model tested with data collected through a survey of managers in subsidiaries of multinational firms, we find dual, independent paths to improved performance - one through networking and inter-unit learning and the other through subsidiary autonomy and innovation. A particular feature of these findings is that they can be shown to be robust after controlling for a wide range of environmental pressures and firm and industry factors. However, in the absence of environmental controls the dual path finding is rejected. These conflicting findings support the imperative to test models that include a diverse range of environmental pressures so that the true effects of organizational factors on learning, innovation and performance can be identified.","['learning', 'innovation', 'performance', 'INTEGRATION-RESPONSIVENESS FRAMEWORK', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'ECONOMIC-GEOGRAPHY', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'INNOVATION', 'FIRM', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['learning', 'innovation', 'performance', 'innovation', 'firm']","['innovation', 'performance', 'firms']",0.6666666666666666,0.4

"The article subjects the assumptions and prescriptions of the ''Corporate Culture' literature to critical scrutiny. The body of the article is devoted to teasing out the distinctive basis of its appeal compared with earlier management theory. It is seen to build upon earlier efforts (e.g. 'theory Y') to constitute a self-disciplining form of employee subjectivity by asserting that ''practical autonomy'' is conditional upon the development of a strong corporate culture. The paper illuminates the dark side of this project by drawing attention to the subjugating and totalitarian implications of its excellence/quality prescriptions. To this end, parallels are drawn with the philosophy of control favoured by the Party in Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Specifically, the paper critiques the ''doublethink'' contention that autonomy can be realized in monocultural conditions that systematically constrain opportunities to wrestle with competing values standpoints and their associated life projects.","['nan', 'CORPORATE CULTURE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MOTIVATION', 'POWER']","['corporate culture', 'management']",[],0,0.0

"Cognitive approaches to strategy have examined the subjective nature of business environments and competitive situations, but have failed to show how managerial mental models lead to superior economic performance.

"Research Summary A firm's strategic orientation has long been of interest in management and strategy research. In particular, entrepreneurial, market, and learning orientations have received thorough theoretical and empirical research attention. In this meta-analysis, we compare the direct and combined performance effects of these orientations, explore their interrelatedness, and provide a theoretical foundation for complementarity between the three. Building on prior empirical findings from 210 samples and using structural equation modeling and seemingly unrelated regression techniques, we extend the knowledge base on strategic orientations. Our results provide evidence for interrelatedness and complementarity among strategic orientations, indicating that superior firm performance emerges from its capability to align entrepreneurial, market, and learning orientations. Managerial Summary Managers might be tempted to divide rather than combine their attention on various aspects of strategy, such as entrepreneurial, market, and learning orientations. Similarly, organizational culture might inhibit or promote collaboration between distinct organizational functions. We synthesize a vast body of research on firm-level strategy making and reveal that while each strategic orientation is beneficial on its own, together, the three strategic orientations create synergies that surpass the effects of individual strategic orientations. Therefore, to achieve superior performance, firms need to align their strategy making efforts to (a) monitoring changes in customer needs and competitor moves, (b) engaging in creative processes, and (c) assimilating the extensive knowledge gained from these activities.","['complementarity', 'firm performance', 'meta-analytic structural equation modeling', 'seemingly unrelated regression', 'strategic orientations', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'SMALL FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION', 'LEARNING ORIENTATION', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'BUSINESS PERFORMANCE', 'DYNAMIC-CAPABILITY', 'PUBLICATION BIAS', 'MODERATING ROLE']","['complementarity', 'firm performance', 'seemingly unrelated regression', 'strategic orientations', 'learning orientation']","['strategic orientation', 'learning orientations', 'meta analysis', 'complementarity', 'firm performance', 'organizational culture']",0.3333333333333333,0.4

These local stakeholders are members of communities of place (CofP), who steward the land their ancestors have inhabited for centuries, and their voices have grown as to how that land is used. As their voices have grown, MNEs should improve CSR outcomes with CofP through better communications.

"The literatures on emotion regulation and emotional labor have generated a considerable amount of knowledge on the relative effectiveness of how people regulate their emotional displays when their feelings are misaligned. By comparison, scholars have ignored the importance of what emotions individuals were feeling prior to the emotion regulation attempt vis-a-vis the emotions they made an effort to display. The consideration of individuals' emotional origins and destinations during an emotion regulation episode leads to the key tenet that both distance and direction are essential concepts that must be integrated into theory and research on emotion regulation. Accordingly, we reconceptualize emotion regulation as a journey involving the joint interplay of distance, direction, and method of travel. Drawing from the circumplex model of affect, we introduce the concepts of emotional distance and emotional direction to map the discrepancies between the emotion an individual currently feels and the emotion that individual attempts to display via emotion regulation. We describe how emotional distance and emotional direction augment constructs and theories relevant to emotion regulation, and we explain how the combined consideration of distance, direction, and method of travel is necessary to fully understand the intrapersonal consequences of regulating emotion.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'CIRCUMPLEX MODEL', 'LABOR', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'WORK', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'EXPRESSION', 'EVENTS', 'MOOD', 'JOB']","['circumplex model', 'labor', 'consequences']",[],0,0.0
"What is the relationship between innovation and firm value? Does the type of innovation make a difference? To answer these questions, the authors examine how breakthrough and incremental innovations affect three different facets of firm performance: normal profits, economic rents, and total firm risk. They argue that each of these metrics is of independent interest to shareholders and managers and that examining one without the others results in an incomplete picture of the true financial value of innovation. Using data on more than 20,000 new products from consumer packaged goods industries, the authors find that breakthrough innovation is associated with increases in both normal profits and economic rents and that, on average, each breakthrough innovation in the sample is associated with an increase in firm value of $4.2 million. Breakthrough innovation is also associated with increases in the risk of the innovating firm, but this higher risk is offset by above-normal stock returns. In contrast, incremental innovation is associated with increases in normal profits only and has no impact on economic rents or firm risk.","['innovation', 'shareholder value', 'firm risk', 'marketing strategy', 'marketing-finance interface', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS', 'SHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'CROSS-SECTION', 'MARKET VALUE', 'INVESTMENT', 'IMPACT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'GOVERNANCE', 'VALUATION']","['innovation', 'firm risk', 'impact', 'performance']","['innovation', 'firm value', 'incremental innovations', 'performance', 'firm risk']",0.6,0.75

"The authors develop a transaction cost model of the circumstances in which small, knowledge-intensive firms switch from the channel they use in the domestic market to a different channel in a foreign market. The authors argue that the domestic channel is frequently extended into a foreign market to gain economies of scale, because product characteristics are generally similar and because of strategic momentum. In knowledge-intensive sectors, integrated channels predominate in both domestic and foreign markets. Integrated channels facilitate the protection of knowledge-based assets and high levels of interaction with customers. However, firms may switch to a less-integrated mode in a foreign market if asset specificity is relatively low, as a response to environmental diversity, and when the market makes a small contribution to overall sales. Data gathered through a disk-by-mad survey of the export channel choices of Canadian software developers generally support these propositions. The authors make a contribution to the literature by rephrasing the channel selection decision so that the conditions under which firms switch modes are emphasized, thus linking the choice of modes in a foreign market to experience in the domestic market. The authors suggest that managers need to be aware of the momentum created by domestic channels and fully evaluate alternatives before extending existing channels into or foreign market. The results help identify conditions under which an international channel strategy that is different from the one used in the home market should be considered for a knowledge-intensive product.","['nan', 'TRANSACTION-COST-ANALYSIS', 'SERVICE FIRMS', 'INTEGRATION', 'ENTRY', 'MODE']",['mode'],[],0,0.0

The evidence from the case study shows that agents reinforce and extend the patterns of action that individual artefacts support by bundling different types of artefacts, and that in so doing, they extend the reach and influence of the community to which they belong. This study shows that the problem-solving and truce aspects of routines are worked out in the design of these systems of artefacts.","['artefacts', 'bidding process', 'building industry', 'organizational routines', 'PFI', 'sociomateriality', 'ORGANIZATIONAL ROUTINES', 'BOUNDARY OBJECTS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'CAPABILITIES', 'REPRESENTATIONS', 'ARTICULATION', 'REPRODUCTION', 'COMMUNITIES', 'PERFORMANCE']",['artefacts'],[],0,0.0
"Purpose - Quality traits desired by consumers may not be adequately captured by beef industry standards associated with grid or value-based pricing alone. Aims to demonstrate this shortcoming by examining strategies of selected companies in North America at the four supply chain levels of cow-calf genetics, feedlot feeding, processing, and retailing that have been proactive in producing desirable beef attributes efficiently to better meet consumer beef demand. Design/methodology/approach - The vertical alliance between Ralphs retailing, Sunland Beef processing, and a handful of feedlots using narrowly defined beef genetics are examined to illustrate how consumer market research and coordination throughout the supply chain may address many shortcomings associated with current value-based pricing of beef criteria. Findings - Better information sharing and coordination between seedstock and retail industries could help assure that consumer preferences of beef palatability and consistency are met while meeting high production efficiency standards. Practical implications - Cow-calf, feedlot, and packing industries need to better track and manage information flows of genetic-management paths from consumer to seedstock producer in order for the beef industry to be more competitive. Originality/value - Experiences of our case companies suggest that the beef industry will need to look beyond the North American grid or value-based pricing of beef in order to maintain or improve market share with competing pork and poultry sectors.","['meat', 'supply chain management', 'animal feed', 'livestock', 'United States of America', 'Canada', 'STATES MEAT DEMAND', 'STRUCTURAL-CHANGE', 'PALATABILITY', 'CATTLE']",['palatability'],[],0,0.0
"The aim of this paper is to summarize literature relevant to the professional organization and to present a contemporary analysis of the archetype concept in this field. In order to understand recent and ongoing changes in professional organizations, the paper begins with a review of how the professional archetype evolved from the 1960s to 1990. Then, with examples from contemporary accounting, health care and law organizations, it considers the processes by which an institutionalized archetype can change. Forces for change - such as deregulation, competition, technology and globalization - can challenge the interpretive scheme and eventually delegitimize the existing archetype. At the same time, significant environmental changes can override isomorphic pressures and de-institutionalize the long-accepted structures. Thus we herald the emergence a new professional archetype - or perhaps several competing archetypes. Finally, the paper reviews the evolving field of professional organization as a whole, and understands the extant archetypes. A typology of professional organizations is proposed that currently seems to have three clusters of organizations - possibly three competing archetypes - namely, the traditional professional partnership, the specialized 'Star' form and the corporate global professional network, or GPN.","['nan', 'LARGE LAW FIRMS', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'SERVICE FIRMS', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'MARKET', 'FORM', 'UK', 'INTERNATIONALIZATION', 'BUREAUCRATIZATION', 'PERSPECTIVE']",['form'],[],0,0.0
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relative importance of price and trust and their interaction in subcontractor selection. By doing so, it aims to respond to the currently dominant view that trust-based procurement is the remedy to performance problems in construction. The paper also aims to argue that a specific interplay of both price and trust is always inherent to the selection of subcontracted services. Design/methodology/approach - A choice-based conjoint experiment was conducted to underpin the initial argument. The conjoint analysis is based on a sample of medium-sized contractors from the Dutch residential building industry. Findings - The research shows that neither price nor trust can be downplayed as procurement mechanisms. On the one hand, through repeated relationships main contractors become more confident in judging the performance of subcontractors. The level of trust increases and finally affects the supplier selection. On the other hand, favourable quotes are a prerequisite for trust to become choice relevant. Moreover, the extent to which subcontractors have performed with respect to quality, technical know-how and cooperation in the past finally accounts for whether they are chosen or not. Research limitations/implications - The joint occurrence of price and trust as procurement mechanisms should be acknowledged. More research is needed to understand the trade-offs main contractors make between price and trust while procuring subcontracted services. Practical implications - Subcontractors need to offer competitive bids to be able to increase their chance of recurrent relationships with main contractors and thus trust development. Originality/value - This study is one of the first that considers the interaction of price and trust in subcontractor procurement. It contributes to the ongoing discussion around partnering and supply chain integration in construction.","['Subcontracting', 'Procurement', 'Prices', 'Trust', 'Construction industry', 'The Netherlands', 'ORGANIZATIONAL TRUST', 'INTEGRATIVE MODEL', 'ALLIANCES', 'SELECTION', 'EMBEDDEDNESS', 'COOPERATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONTRACTOR', 'CHOICE', 'VIEW']","['procurement', 'trust', 'selection', 'cooperation', 'performance', 'contractor', 'choice', 'view']","['trust', 'selection', 'conjoint', 'analysis']",0.5,0.25
"Although researchers have documented many instances of crowd wisdom, it is important to know whether some kinds of judgments may lead the crowd astray, whether crowds' judgments improve with feedback over time, and whether crowds' judgments can be improved by changing the way judgments are elicited. We investigated these questions in a sports gambling context (predictions against point spreads) believed to elicit crowd wisdom. In a season-long experiment, fans wagered over $20,000 on NFL football predictions. Contrary to the wisdom-of-crowds hypothesis, faulty intuitions led the crowd to predict favorites more than underdogs against point spreads that disadvantaged favorites, even when bettors knew that the spreads disadvantaged favorites. Moreover, the bias increased over time, a result consistent with attributions for success and failure that rewarded intuitive choosing. However, when the crowd predicted game outcomes by estimating point differentials rather than by predicting against point spreads, its predictions were unbiased and wiser.","['nan', 'MARKET-EFFICIENCY', 'RATIONALITY', 'CONFIDENCE', 'ECONOMICS', 'FORECASTS', 'JUDGMENT', 'RISK']",['judgment'],"['crowd wisdom', 'attributions']",0.0,0.0
"Can cause marketing (CM) be effective? If so, do price discounts moderate CM effectiveness? Despite the prevalence of linking product sales with donations to charity, field evidence of CM effectiveness is lacking. This is of particular concern for managers who wonder whether the findings of laboratory experiments extend to actual consumer purchases. Using large-scale randomized field experiments with more than 17,000 consumers, this research documents that CM can significantly increase consumer purchases. Notably, the answer to the second question is more complicated. Under the moderating role of price discounts, the impact of CM on sales purchases may follow an inverted U-shaped relationship-that is, strongest when price discounts are moderate rather than deep or absent. Follow-up lab experiments reveal that consumers' warm-glow good feelings from CM represent the underlying process. These findings provide novel insights into the boundary conditions and mechanisms of the sales impact of CM for researchers and managers alike.","['cause marketing', 'social responsibility', 'warm glow', 'discounts', 'field experiment', 'CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'CONSUMER RESPONSES', 'DONATION AMOUNT', 'TRADE-OFFS', 'WARM GLOW', 'INCENTIVES', 'BRAND', 'PURCHASE', 'CHARITY', 'PROMOTIONS']","['cause marketing', 'warm glow', 'discounts', 'field experiment', 'warm glow', 'purchase', 'charity']","['can cause marketing', 'price discounts', 'warm glow']",0.3333333333333333,0.14285714285714285
"Since new firms generally lack the resources necessary to compete with their larger, older counterparts in the knowledge development process, we argue that they often rely on spillovers to fuel their own innovative efforts. Thus, we hypothesize that new firms will tend to form in areas characterized by high levels of university research and development (R & D) expenditures and that these births will in turn stimulate the local economy by generating increases in employment level and growth. We test our hypotheses at the U.S. labor market area level using secondary data from various government sources for the years 1990 through 1999. Our results demonstrate that university R & D expenditures are positively related to new firm formations, and that these new firm formations are positively related to employment level and change. These findings suggest that university R & D expenditures are an important indirect contributor to overall economic growth by encouraging primary and secondary firm births.","['nan', 'REGIONAL VARIATION', 'INNOVATION', 'SPILLOVERS', 'FIRMS', 'SURVIVAL', 'INDUSTRY', 'SIZE']","['spillovers', 'firms', 'size']","['firms', 'university research and development']",0.5,0.3333333333333333
"Many of the most pivotal mechanisms of team success are emergent phenomenaconstructs with conceptual origins at the individual level that coalesce over time through members' interactions to characterize a team as a whole. Typically, empirical research on teams represents emergent mechanisms as the aggregate of members' self-report perceptions of the team. This dominant approach assumes members have developed a perception of the emergent property and are able to respond accurately to survey items. Yet emergent phenomena require sufficient time and team interaction before coalescing as perceptible team properties. Attempting to measure an emergent property before it is perceptible can result in inaccurate assessments and substantive conclusions. Therefore, a key purpose of this study is to develop a better understanding of the underlying characteristics of emergent team phenomena that give rise to their emergence as perceptible and, thus, accurately measurable team characteristics. We advance a conceptual framework that classifies emergent team properties on the basis of the degree to which the construct manifests in overtly observable behaviors, positing that more observable emergent team phenomena require less interaction before emerging as ratable team properties compared to constructs that are less easily observed. Leveraging advances in measurement modeling, we test our conceptual framework in a laboratory sample and a quasi-field study sample, demonstrating a multilevel measurement approach that evaluates the emergence of shared team properties across measurement occasions. Results suggest the observability of emergent team properties is a crucial determinant of the relative speed at which constructs emerge as recognizable, ratable properties of the team.","['teams', 'emergence', 'processes', 'emergent states', 'item response theory', 'ITEM RESPONSE THEORY', 'TRANSACTIVE MEMORY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODELS', 'CONSTRUCTS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'FRAMEWORK', 'COGNITION', 'DYNAMICS', 'COHESION']","['teams', 'emergence', 'constructs', 'framework']",[],0,0.0
"A neo-Gramscian theoretical framework for corporate political strategy is developed drawing from Gramsci's analysis of the relations among, capital, social forces, and the state, and from more contemporary theories. Gramsci's political theory recognizes the centrality of organizations and strategy, directs attention to the organizational, economic, and ideological pillars of power, while illuminating the processes of coalition budding, conflict, and accommodation that drive social change. This approach addresses the structure-Agency relationship and endogenous dynamics in a way that could enrich institutional theory. The framework suggests a strategic concept of power, which provides space for contestation by subordinate groups in complex dynamic social systems. We apply the framework to analyse the international negotiations to control emissions of greenhouse gases, focusing on the responses of firms in the US and European oil and automobile industries. The neo-Gramscian framework explains some specific, features of corporate responses to challenges to their hegemonic position and points to the importance, of political struggles within civil society. The analysis suggests that the conventional demarcation between market and non-market strategies is untenable, given the embeddedness of markets in contested social and political structures and the political character of strategies directed toward defending and enhancing markets, technologies, corporate autonomy and legitimacy.","['nan', 'BUSINESS', 'POLICY', 'STATE', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'INNOVATION', 'DYNAMICS']","['state', 'dynamics']",[],0,0.0
"When they lack resources to commercialize science, entrepreneurs rely on intermediary organizations often within their local ecosystems. This paper seeks to improve our understanding of how intermediaries operate to advance the commercialization of science by providing a set of specialized services. We review five intermediaries commonly mentioned in the ecosystem literature: university technology transfer and licensing offices; physical space (incubators, accelerators, and co-working spaces); professional services providers; networking, connecting, and assisting organizations; and finance providers (including venture capital, angel investors, public financing, and crowdfunding). Specifically, we explore how these various intermediaries function and provide complementary and related services in support of scientific commercialization through entrepreneurship. After defining intermediation, we review the literature on each organization type, providing a definition and considering the contribution of the intermediary and the related policy implications.

"As young people increasingly become the target of entrepreneurial and enterprise policy initiatives and enterprise education in schools increases, so does the need to effectively measure the impact these programs have. A research instrument was designed to measure enterprise potential in young people using attitudes toward characteristics associated with entrepreneurship. A control-group cross-sectional design was used to investigate the impact of participation in a Young Enterprise Company Program, which is based on the U.S. Junior Achievement model, in six secondary schools in London, United Kingdom. The study found that participation in a Company Program can foster positive attitudes toward self-employment and that participants displayed greater enterprise potential than nonparticipants. Demographic differences also emerged in enterprise potential between ethnic groups. Young Black people were more positive about self-employment and displayed greater enterprise potential than either White or Asian pupils. A family background of self-employment had a positive influence on pupils' intentions to become self-employed.

"We investigate the participation of engaged consumers in the fashion market through the lens of institutional theory. We develop theoretical insights on the unintended market-level changes that ensue when consumers who are avidly interested in a field connect to share ideas with one another. We find that consumers take on some of the institutional work previously done primarily by paid actors and introduce new forms of institutional work supportive of the field. We show that engaged consumers can precipitate the formation of new categories of actors in the field and the contestation of boundaries between established and emergent actor categories. Further, we propose that new consumer-focused institutional logics gain momentum, even while consumers support and promote preexisting logics through their practices. We compare cases where discontented market actors have brought about market changes with our investigation of one where contented consumers unintentionally precipitated market-level dynamics, and we show that the accumulation of consumers' micro-level practices can have pervasive and profound impacts.","['nan', 'CONSUMPTION', 'FASHION', 'COMMUNITIES', 'SPEAKING', 'CREATION', 'INNOVATION', 'CULTURE', 'USERS', 'TASTE']",['fashion'],"['fashion', 'institutional theory', 'institutional logics']",0.3333333333333333,1.0
"Research Summary Scholars have long recognized the theoretical and practical implications of firm-specifichuman capital. However, we highlight that firm-specificincentives(i.e., worker incentives that provide more utility to workers in the focal firm than similar incentives available at other employers) provide an important pathway to competitive advantages that has not been comprehensively examined in the extant organizational research. We address this gap by (a) defining firm-specific incentives and showing why they are different from incentive conceptualizations and typologies in the extant literature, (b) articulating potential origins of firm-specific incentives, and (c) formally proposing the conditions under which firm-specific incentives facilitate human capital-based competitive advantages. In so doing, we develop a cohesive theoretical framework of incentive-based competitive advantage that integrates across multiple literatures. Managerial Summary Just as companies differentiate their products by creating unique value for customers, they also create unique value for their employees. Some companies do this by offering employee incentives, perks, and benefits that are highly unique to the company and difficult for other companies to imitate. These unique incentives, perks, and benefits can help these companies to attract, motivate, and retain top talent at a financial discount and, accordingly, can help these companies realize competitive advantages over their rivals.","['firm-specific human capital', 'human capital-based competitive advantage', 'incentive-based competitive advantage', 'strategic human capital', 'strategic incentives', 'HUMAN-RESOURCES', 'JOB EMBEDDEDNESS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY', 'COMPREHENSIVE MODEL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'COMPENSATION', 'REPUTATION', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'CONSEQUENCES']","['human capital based competitive advantage', 'incentive based competitive advantage']","['specifichuman capital', 'worker incentives', 'competitive advantages', 'human capital']",0.0,0.0
"Consumers around the globe expect firms to contribute to environmentally and socially responsible causes. Using construal level theory with a spatial distance lens, we examine effects of spatial proximity of the firm (domestic firm vs. foreign multinational corporation [MNC]), cause (domestic vs. global), and consumer cultural identity (locally oriented: nationalism and consumer ethnocentrism; distantly oriented: global identity and global citizenship through global brands) on consumer attitudes toward the firm. Across three studies with a focus on Russia and environmental causes, we consistently find that nationalism moderates consumer attitudes, whereas consumer ethnocentrism, global identity, and global citizenship through global brands do not. When firms engage in cause-related marketing and focus on proximal causes, nationalistic consumers are more favorable toward domestic firms (vs. foreign MNCs). When firms are not engaged in cause-related marketing, consumers with stronger nationalism are more favorable toward domestic firms, and consumers with weaker nationalism are more favorable toward foreign MNCs. Importantly, the effects of nationalism are mitigated when foreign MNCs and domestic firms engage with global causes. Product involvement, environmental concerns, and marketplace skepticism are predictors of attitudes toward the firm. The results highlight the importance of considering the socio-historical-political context of a given country and locally oriented nationalistic beliefs.","['cause-related marketing', 'construal level theory', 'cultural identity', 'environmental sustainability', 'nationalism', 'CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'PERCEIVED BRAND GLOBALNESS', 'CONSUMER ETHNOCENTRISM', 'CSR', 'IDENTITY', 'ORIENTATION', 'STRATEGIES', 'INTERPLAY', 'ATTITUDES', 'FOREIGN']","['cause related marketing', 'construal level theory', 'cultural identity', 'nationalism', 'consumer ethnocentrism', 'identity', 'attitudes', 'foreign']","['construal level theory', 'spatial distance', 'identity', 'consumer ethnocentrism', 'global brands', 'russia', 'cause related marketing', 'involvement']",0.5,0.5
"Past research has yielded valuable insights into the drivers of traditional coupon redemption, but the applicability of these results to electronic coupons remains an open question. We investigate the determinants of electronic coupon redemption, employing a large panel dataset for five product categories (detergent, milk, cookies, shampoo, and orange juice) for the period 2003-2005. Our findings reveal that education and employment positively influence redemption rates and our analysis indicates that these findings are not due to unobserved individual effects. The focus is on comparing coupon-use discrepancies between national and private label brands when the characteristics of coupons are taken into account. A higher face value appears to be a critical element in electronic coupon format, and this gives rise to more purchases for nonperishables (shampoo and detergent). Results also show significant seasonal variations in milk and orange-juice coupon usage. Furthermore, the distance of consumers from the redemption location has a significantly negative effect, whereas the expiration date has no evident effect. The implications for electronic coupon research and practice are discussed. (C) 2008 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"This article seeks to examine the effect of changes in retail-grocery market conditions upon consumer prices and the response of food retailers to these conditions. We explore these issues for two different product groups. One is composed primarily of branded, dry and frozen groceries (PI) while the second largely represents produce, meat, and perishable products (P2). Our statistical model finds that the effect of the of these new market conditions is often markedly sensitive to product type. Competitive conditions affect both price measures, bur entry by warehouse and similar grocery formats surprisingly lower perishable prices more than those for staple goods. We also observe that frequent price changes in a market serves to reduce food prices, suggesting that promotional activities in response to new format competition are beneficial for consumers. There is strong evidence of a fast food-supermarket rivalry, but we are unable to identify its specific nature.

More recently, scholars have hypothesized that norms of knowledge use may indirectly promote it. In this article, we synthesize a theoretical framework of the effect of norms of knowledge use and test its predictions by means of a field experiment involving more than 500 Italian chefs. For the literature on knowledge transfer, we confirm the importance of norms, but we also show that they are not complete substitutes for other means of protecting private knowledge. For the literature on social norms, we provide evidence of how actors assess others' propensity to conform and how this influences the intention to participate in the norm-regulated exchange.

"Radical innovations are engines of economic growth and the focus of much academic and practitioner interest, yet some fundamental questions remain unanswered. The authors use theoretical arguments on the risk associated with radical innovations, and the resources needed for them, to answer the following questions on the sources and financial consequences of radical innovation: (1) Who introduces a greater number of radical innovations: dominant or nondominant firms? (2) How great are the financial rewards to radical innovations, and how do these rewards vary across dominant and nondominant firms? (3) Is it only a firm's resources in the aggregate or also its focus and leverage of resources that make its innovations more financially valuable? and (4) Which are more valuable: innovations that incorporate a breakthrough technology or innovations that provide a substantial increase in customer benefits? The authors pool information from a disparate set of sources in the pharmaceutical industry to study these questions. Results indicate that a large majority of radical innovations come from a minority of firms. The financial rewards of innovation vary dramatically across firms and are tied closely to firms' resource base. Firms that provide higher per-product levels of marketing and technology support obtain much greater financial rewards from their radical innovations than do other firms. Firms that have greater depth and breadth in their product portfolio also gain more from their radical innovations.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'SHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'MARKET VALUE', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'INDUSTRY', 'CAPABILITIES', 'IMPACT', 'SIZE']",['industry'],[],0,0.0
"The aim of this paper is to review the important themes in the literature on benchmarking, and to assess the contribution to knowledge provided thus far. Four themes from the literature are highlighted: studies of the nature of benchmarking practice; criticisms of benchmarking; evaluating the effectiveness of benchmarking; and the notion of best practice. The authors argue that, while the literature does include a few critical analyses of the practice and impacts of benchmarking, it is dominated by relatively descriptive, and even prescriptive, accounts of the 'realities' of benchmarking. The longer-term (qualitative and quantitative) effects and perspectives of diverse stakeholders on benchmarking are largely neglected. This selective focus has implications for the contribution of benchmarking research to practice, for example, in terms of the role of internal organizational capabilities in analysing the performance of processes and managing communications and change.

"This study examines the impact of transformational and transactional leader behaviors on the sales performance and organizational citizenship behaviors of salespeople, as well as the mediating role played by trust and role ambiguity in that process. Measures of six forms of transformational leader behavior two forms of transactional leader behavior trust, and role ambiguity were obtained from 477 sales agents working for a large national insurance company. Objective sales performance data were obtained for the agents, and their supervisors provided evaluations of their citizenship behaviors. The findings validate not only the basic notion that transformational leadership influences salespeople to perform above and beyond the call of duty but also that transformational leader behaviors actually have stronger direct and indirect relationships with sales performance and organizational citizenship behavior than transactional leader behaviors.

"International business literature has largely explained the international dispersion of firms' activities as a choice based on trade-offs between cost minimisation, knowledge seeking, managing transaction costs and maintaining control. By incorporating insights from operations management, we propose a framework that explicitly takes into account products' physical and knowledge attributes that constrain the viable international configuration options available to firms. Linking the characteristics of a product to the scope for horizontal and vertical decoupling in a value network allows us to re-frame recent discussions in the literature about fragmentation of activities vs tasks and to develop an overall picture of the way industry-specific peculiarities characterise (and also constrain) viable international configurations. We show how our framework can be used to interpret data on the scope for decoupling and dispersion collected from industry experts and elucidate the relationships between configuration options and measures of product characteristics. We then utilise this framework to predict how emerging technologies will reshape the international configuration options available to firms.","['value chain', 'supply network configuration', 'product attributes', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'ARCHITECTURE', 'MODULARITY', 'BUSINESS', 'CHAINS', 'TRADE']","['knowledge', 'business', 'trade']",['configuration'],0.0,0.0

In contrast, founders with greater experience in the field's periphery are more likely to act as innovative entrepreneurs, as are those who more strongly question the ethicality of prevailing practices.

As an illustration, thiezezs research focuses on on-line auction mechanisms and develops a Leveled Partition Set (LPS) protocol for multi-unit sealed-bid auctions. LPS prevents on-line false-name bidding whereby bidders increase their utility by splitting their bids for a large bundle to several smaller bundles under false identities.","['economic mechanisms', 'electronic commerce', 'information system', 'multi-unit auction', 'on-line auction', 'security', 'nan']","['economic mechanisms', 'on line auction', 'security']","['authentication', 'line auction mechanisms', 'leveled partition set']",0.0,0.0
"Scholars identify several benefits of new product introductions (NPI), yet prior literature largely overlooks how the process of NPI generates marketplace insights and influences subsequent products. Building on the concept of absorptive capacity, the authors argue that the influence of products on firm value depends on process characteristics, namely, the pace, irregularity, and scope of NPI. Using data collected from multiple sources for products introduced by pharmaceutical firms between 1991 and 2015 and robust econometric methods that account for endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity, this study reveals that pace and scope have an inverted U-shaped effect on firm value, whereas irregularity negatively influences firm value. Moreover, strategic emphasis and product complexity negatively moderate the relationship of the irregularity and scope of NPI with firm value. This research documents the importance of adopting a portfolio approach to the sequential introduction of new products and incorporating insights gained from previous product introductions; it cautions managers against evaluating products in isolation. The authors discuss the economic significance of these results and provide actionable guidance for managers.","['new product introduction', 'innovation', 'process research', 'event study', 'firm value', 'DEVELOPMENT CYCLE TIME', 'STOCK RETURNS', 'CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'STRATEGIC EMPHASIS', 'COMPLEXITY THEORY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['new product introduction', 'firm value', 'absorptive capacity', 'strategic emphasis']","['new product introductions', 'absorptive capacity', 'firm value', 'pace irregularity']",0.5,0.5
"Several recent studies have investigated international differences in advertising practices. Most of these address advertising in general, leaving the transferability of comparative advertising practices largely unexplored. Based on a theoretical framework of consumer skepticism toward novel information, we conducted a cross-national study to examine the effectiveness of comparative ad format and message content advertising executions under conditions of market and sponsor brand novelty, and loyalty toward the comparison brand. Analyses of responses from participants in France, the Netherlands, and the United States indicate that novelty of the brand and novelty of the practice of comparative advertising interact with various ad elements to produce both desirable and undesirable outcomes.","['comparative advertising', 'brand novelty', 'market novelty', 'COMPARATIVE ADVERTISEMENTS', 'CONSUMER', 'COMMITMENT', 'STRATEGIES', 'MEMORY', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'ATTITUDE', 'BELIEFS', 'IMPACT']","['comparative advertising', 'brand novelty', 'consumer']",[],0,0.0
"This article reports the principal findings of over 200 studies of work motivation published between January 1990 and December 1997. We examined research relevant to seven traditional motivational theories (Motives and Needs, Expectancy Theory, Equity Theory, Goal-Setting, Cognitive Evaluation Theory, Work Design, and Reinforcement Theory) and three emerging topic areas (Creativity, Groups, and Culture). For each area, we summarize the research, identify trends and discuss issues that deserve further research attention.

"In this paper we use a mixed-methods engineering approach to analyze how traditional retailers can use mobile commerce services to enable data-driven marketing and thus compete with the pervasive end-customer ownership of companies controlling the mobile channel. The paper provides the first systematic analysis of the implications of the virtual world market players Apple, Google, Facebook, eBay/PayPal, and Amazon on traditional retailers' business. We use case study research to identify the elements that are required for and suitable to such a strategy. In a second step, we use design science in order to identify and develop the necessary value creation roles, their activities, and the value flows between them. The paper provides two major outcomes: (1) a set of 12 building blocks for generating and applying customer data for traditional retailers adding mobile services and (2) a role-based reference model for the value network of the future retail customer interface and marketing (CIM). The reference model is validated with expert interviews. As an exemplary application of the model, we show two extreme scenarios with strong and weak retailer market positions. As an additional contribution to practice, we present a further introspective analysis of the value network's key new role-that of mobile customer relationship management service provider-and propose a corresponding functional component architecture that fulfills the information technology requirements for the role's complex functionality.","['AGFEA', 'big data', 'CIM', 'data-driven marketing', 'e-tail', 'IT strategy', 'mobile CRM service provider', 'mobile services', 'retail innovation', 'strategic impact of digitization', 'value network', 'BUSINESS MODELS', 'MOBILE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'DETERMINANTS', 'INTERNET', 'INTENTIONS', 'CHALLENGES', 'STRATEGIES', 'SERVICES', 'COMMERCE']","['cim', 'data driven marketing', 'mobile services', 'value network', 'mobile', 'services', 'commerce']","['mobile commerce services', 'data', 'marketing', 'creation']",0.0,0.0
"As a fascinating concept, organizational memory attracts many researchers from a variety of disciplines. Of particular interest are the components of organizational memory, which include declarative memory (i.e., memory for facts, events, or propositions including know-what, know-why, or know-when) and procedural memory (i.e., memory for how things are done or can be done, routines, or procedures). Given the importance of (1) declarative memory that allows people to analyze new problems, generate new interpretations of current information, and use that information in a variety of applications, and (2) procedural memory for guiding and influencing actions of individuals, and facilitating automatic behaviors and skills to speed up task executions in the organizations, it is clear why researchers indicate that these memory contents are critical for innovativeness in the firm. On the other hand, remarkably, there is sparse research in the literature on the emotional aspect of organizational memory (emotional memory) and its effect on firm innovativeness. Emotional memory in general is the storage of past emotional experiences or events in organizations. In this study, we operationalized an organization's emotional memory as a multidimensional construct involving past emotional experience level, dispersion, and storage in organizations. We also identified the past emotional experience vividness or clearance as a moderator factor determining the availability of the emotional memory in organizational memory. By studying 103 firms, and using the partial least squares method, we found that (1) emotional experience storage influences organizational declarative and procedural memory; (2) emotional experience dispersion impacts organizational procedural memory; and (3) emotional experience level affects the organizational declarative and procedural memory to the extent that emotional experience vividness or clearance increases. We also found that emotional experience dispersion has a direct influence on firm innovativeness. Finally, we demonstrated that organizational declarative memory partially mediates the relationship between organizational emotional memory and firm innovativeness, such that emotional experience storage influences innovativeness in the firm via organizational declarative memory. This study concludes with several theoretical and managerial implications.","['nan', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL', 'CONVERGENCE', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'WORKPLACE', 'IMPACT', 'ERROR', 'SELF']",['impact'],['organizational memory'],0.0,0.0
"Businesses rely on knowledge interfaces to gather and integrate knowledge that drives innovation and builds competitive advantage. But key knowledge interfaces such as cross-functional teams (CFTs), frontline employees (FLEs), and learning orientation have not shown consistent effects on innovation outcomes in prior research. This study addresses that problem by testing a mediation model that extends the service-dominant logic service innovation framework developed by Ordanini and Parasuraman. Based on analyses of 160 new service development (NSD) projects, the authors find that CFTs, FLEs, and learning orientation consistently influence NSD sales and process efficiency outcomes when they first create a service having (1) superior attributes and expert frontline employee service delivery (service marketability) and/or (2) a well-targeted launch with formal promotion to internal and external markets (launch effectiveness). Those NSD project characteristics in turn yield favorable new service performance results. Specifically, service marketability and launch effectiveness mediate the influence of CFTs on NSD outcomes. Launch effectiveness mediates the influence of learning orientation, and service marketability mediates the impact of FLEs. In ranking the organizational resources, the study finds that CFTs and learning orientation have greater effect on NSD sales performance than do FLEs. The results highlight the importance of aligning CFTs, FLEs, and learning orientation with NSD project characteristics in order to maximize sales performance and process efficiency.","['cross-functional teams', 'frontline employees', 'learning orientation', 'NSD process', 'success factors', 'new service development performance', 'service-dominant logic', 'mediation', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'COMMON METHOD VARIANCE', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'DOMINANT LOGIC', 'INNOVATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'CUSTOMER', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'MANAGEMENT']","['cross functional teams', 'frontline employees', 'learning orientation', 'service dominant logic', 'mediation', 'dominant logic', 'innovation', 'knowledge']","['cross functional teams', 'frontline employees', 'learning orientation', 'service dominant logic', 'performance']",0.8,0.5
"This study presents empirical evidence on the nature and magnitude of the benefits that franchisees derive from franchising I test the proposition that the demand for franchise opportunities is derived from the demand for (1) managerial inputs and (2) risk-sharing, which are supplied by franchisors in this cooperative form of ownership. I explore the importance of these factors and others in the content of a discrete-choice model of entrepreneurs' choice between noncooperative, independent ownership and franchising. Estimates of entrepreneurs' gains from trade are obtained by comparing selection-adjusted profit functions for franchisees and independent owners. The results indicate that entrepreneurs derive substantial gains from trade: franchisees would have significantly lower profits as independent owners. This is due primarily to unobservable differences between entrepreneurs that choose franchising and those who do not. It is suggested that because of these unobservable differences in entrepreneurs, franchisors face an adverse selection problem that may explain terms of the franchise contract such as screening of potential franchisees and at will termination provisions.","['nan', 'SELF-EMPLOYMENT', 'SELECTION', 'IMMIGRANTS', 'ECONOMICS', 'CONTRACTS', 'MARKETS', 'FORM']","['selection', 'form']",[],0,0.0
"While theories of signaling and conspicuous consumption suggest that more explicit markers facilitate communication, this article examines the utility of subtle signals. Four studies demonstrate that while less explicit branding increases the likelihood of misidentification (e. g., observers confusing a high-end purchase for a cheaper alternative), people with more cultural capital in a particular domain prefer subtle signals because they provide differentiation from the mainstream. Such insiders have the necessary connoisseurship to decode the meaning of subtle signals that facilitate communication with others in the know. Consistent with the notion that these effects are driven by outward communication, they are stronger in identity-relevant product domains and situations where consumption is more public. This work highlights the communication value of less explicit signals and discusses the implications for branding, signal persistence, and the communication of identity.","['nan', 'IDENTITY', 'POSSESSIONS']",['identity'],['identity'],1.0,1.0
"While cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) involving emerging markets have been increasing in recent years, a high percentage collapse before completion. This study investigates how the predictors of cross-border M&A completion involving emerging markets depend upon the direction of global expansion, i.e., investment inbound to a developing market or outbound from a developing market. Analysis based on 15 years of data from four emerging economies, Brazil, Russia, India, and China, from 1995 to 2010, reveals fundamental differences in the predictors of inbound vs. outbound M&A completion. Country-level factors reflecting differences in political, trade, and legal environments strongly affect the completion for inbound M&As, but have a much weaker influence on outbound M&As. By contrast, firm-level factors such as past M&A experience have a significantly stronger effect on completion for outbound than for inbound M&As. Most interestingly, two deal level factors (the percentage of stake sought by the acquirer and whether or not the deal is a cash transaction) increase the likelihood of completion for inbound but decrease it for outbound M&As. These findings have important managerial implications for enhancing the success of global expansions.","['completion failure', 'emerging markets', 'global expansions', 'cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As)', 'organizational learning', 'international marketing', 'ACQUISITION EXPERIENCE', 'NATIONAL CULTURE', 'VOTING-RIGHTS', 'MERGERS', 'ENTRY', 'FIRMS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'SUCCESS', 'LEARN', 'INSTITUTIONS']","['emerging markets', 'global expansions', 'cross border mergers and acquisitions m as ', 'mergers', 'success']","['mergers and acquisitions', 'emerging markets', 'emerging economies', 'expansions']",0.25,0.2
"For a seller that markets event tickets both in advance and on spot, a concern is that ticket resale may hurt its profitability. The conventional wisdom is for the seller to consider completely banning resale if possible. This article considers an alternative strategy in which resale is only partially restricted; specifically, resale is banned on spot but still allowed in advance. Using a two-period model in which buyers have discreet valuations, the authors show that it is possible for partial resale to outperform no resale (and also unrestricted resale at the other extreme) in terms of seller profitability when the following conditions hold: when the seller has limited capacity, when the number of high-valuation buyers is small enough, and when the number of early arrivers is not too large. An implication of this research is that when consumers conduct advance and spot resale in different channels, such as advance resale online and spot resale off line, the seller may be better off adopting different resale policies for different channels.","['nan', 'MARKETS']",['markets'],"['resale', 'valuations']",0.0,0.0
"Applicant impression management tactics have been shown to positively influence interviewer evaluations. This study extends previous research by examining the moderating roles of interview structure, customer-contact requirement, and interview length in real employment interviews for actual job openings. Results from 151 applicants of 25 firms showed that the more structured the interview, the weaker the relationship between applicant nonverbal tactics and interviewer evaluation. In addition, when the extent of customer contact required for a job was relatively low, the influence of applicant self-focused tactics on interviewer evaluation was minimized. Furthermore, when the interview was of longer duration, the effects of applicant self-focused tactics became insignificant.","['job interviews', 'impression management tactics', 'interview structure', 'interview length', 'customer-contact requirement', 'GRADUATE SELECTION INTERVIEW', 'EMPLOYMENT INTERVIEW', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'VALIDITY', 'OUTCOMES', 'JUDGMENTS', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'PERSONALITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'QUALIFICATIONS']","['impression management tactics', 'interview structure', 'interview length', 'customer contact requirement', 'employment interview']",['impression management'],0.0,0.0
"How do subsidiaries respond to normative demands from both their headquarters and local external constituents? We propose that subsidiaries pay varying levels of attention to demands depending on their peers' norm-conforming behavior, resulting in heterogeneous practice implementation. We study the implementation of 25 practices, associated with three corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues in 101 worldwide subsidiaries of a multinational enterprise (MNE). Consistent with the idea that attention is limited and therefore selective, we find that external peers' conformity to the CSR norm directs subsidiaries' attention toward the CSR-related demands of external constituents at the expense of the demands from the headquarters. However, internal peers' conformity increases attention to both external and headquarters' demands related to CSR. As higher attention levels result in higher practice implementation, internal and external peers' conformity drives the heterogeneity of practice implementation in the MNE. Our results suggest the need to rethink the influence of peers' conformity on subsidiaries' implementation of practices, as it not only triggers mimicry based on legitimacy but also and simultaneously a more strategic response based on internal and external competitive threats and attention allocation.","['multinational corporations (MNCs) and enterprises (MNEs)', 'institutional theory', 'corporate social responsibility', 'practice implementation', 'attention', 'simultaneous equation modeling', 'COMMON METHOD VARIANCE', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSES', 'INSTITUTIONAL THEORY', 'SUBSIDIARIES', 'MNC', 'ADAPTATION', 'STRATEGY', 'ADOPTION', 'ARCHITECTURE']","['corporate social responsibility', 'practice implementation', 'attention', 'subsidiaries']","['attention', 'corporate social responsibility', 'multinational enterprise', 'allocation']",0.5,0.5
"Purpose - Recently, in response to the credit crunch and the increased costs of financing, new solutions for supporting the financial management of supply chains, known as supply chain finance (SCF), have been developed. They exploit the strengths of supply chain links to optimise working capital. The purpose of this paper is to provide a reference framework that links together the objectives leading to the adoption of SCF solutions and several moderating variables. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts a multiple case study methodology, analysing 14 cases of the application of SCF solutions among Italian companies. Findings - The main findings are the identification of the different objectives leading to the adoption of SCF; the analysis of the impact of moderating variables (the level of inter- and intra-firm collaboration, the level of the trade process digitalisation and the bargaining power and financial strength of the leading firm) on SCF adoption; and the formulation of a reference framework supporting the effective adoption of SCF solutions. Research limitations/implications - This contribution is exploratory in nature; theory-testing contributions should be the focus of further research. Also, the sample is limited to Italian companies. Finally, the service provider's point of view has been marginally taken into consideration in this study. Originality/value - The article addresses the need for more empirical research on SCF. It provides a reference framework focused on the objectives and moderating variables leading to effective SCF adoption, providing a theory-building contribution on the general topic of SCF and on the specific topic of the adoption process of different SCF solutions.","['Case studies', 'Financial performance', 'Collaboration', 'Supply chain risk management', 'TRADE CREDIT', 'RISK-MANAGEMENT', 'COLLABORATION', 'BENEFITS', 'SINGLE', 'DELAY', 'MODEL', 'VMI']","['collaboration', 'collaboration']",['supply chain finance'],0.0,0.0
"Purpose - This paper aims to examine the effects of green supply chain management (GSCM) on environmental and operational performances with a perspective of social capital accumulation in the supply chain. The roles of structural capital and relational social capital in GSCM were empirically explored. Design/methodology/approach - A research model was developed to investigate the effects of GSCM on a supplier's environmental and operational performances through structural and relational social capitals. Using an exploratory factor analysis, the study identified the structural and relational dimensions of social capital and the environmental and operational performance dimensions of supplier's performance. The hypotheses were tested on data of 207 responses collected from supplying firms in South Korea, using structural equation modeling. Findings - The paper finds that GSCM contributes to the environmental and operational performance improvements of the supply chain through social capital accumulation. Relational capital, in particular, plays a more important pivoting role in the relationships between GSCM and environmental and operational performances. Practical implications - The findings of this paper provide useful insights about how supply chain members should integrate environmental issues into supply chain management practices that would enhance social capital accumulation to foster stronger operational and environmental performances throughout the entire supply chain. Originality/value - This research is one of the few studies that explore the effects of GSCM on performance by explicitly considering social capital as an important intervening variable. By applying social capital theory, this study provides theoretical underpinning for furthering the GSCM literature.","['Environmental performance', 'Operational performance', 'Green supply chain management', 'Social capital', 'Structural equation modeling', 'ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'CAPABILITIES', 'IMPACT', 'IMPROVEMENT', 'OPERATIONS', 'CORPORATE']","['environmental performance', 'operational performance', 'green supply chain management', 'social capital', 'structural equation modeling', 'improvement']","['supply chain management', 'social capital', 'firms']",0.3333333333333333,0.16666666666666666
"Research Summary: We advance the concept of organization-stakeholder fit (O-S fit) to explain cooperative behavior between an organization and its stakeholders. O-S fit describes the compatibility that exists between an organization and a stakeholder when their characteristics are well matched. We highlight two dimensions of O-S fit: value congruence, or the supplementary fit of organizational and stakeholder values, and strategic complementarity, or the complementary fit of strategic needs and resources. For each dimension, we detail the unique relational factors-including core elements of trust, predictability, attraction/exchange, and communication-that motivate cooperation. We then explicate the ways in which value congruence and strategic complementarity dynamically interrelate over time. Finally, we consider how organization-stakeholder misfit may result in alternative relational behaviors, such as conflict or compromise. Managerial Summary: We develop a new way of thinking about the relationship between organizations and stakeholders. Recognizing that positive relationships require a degree of fit or compatibility, we argue that cooperative behavior between an organization and its stakeholders is maximized when relational partners share both core values and strategic priorities. We explain that high fit along these two dimensions increases trust, relational predictability, attraction/exchange, and communication. We also describe how positive relationships might be formed with fit along only one dimension, and how negative relationships might result in the presence of misfit. Ultimately, we suggest that managers who want to foster positive relationships with stakeholders should concentrate on aligning their values and priorities, rather than simply concentrating on one or the other.","['cooperative strategy', 'fit', 'interorganizational relationships', 'reciprocity', 'stakeholder management', 'PERSON-ENVIRONMENT FIT', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS', 'PARTNER SELECTION', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'VALUE CREATION', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'SELF-DETERMINATION', 'VALUE CONGRUENCE', 'TRUST', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['fit', 'value congruence', 'trust']","['stakeholder fit', 'value congruence', 'strategic complementarity', 'trust', 'misfit']",0.4,0.6666666666666666
"Addressing the research question of what influences the likelihood of an individual being labeled as 'talent' in MNCs, this paper seeks to understand the decision processes involved in the identification of MNC-internal talent. We develop a framework suggesting that the decision to include an employee in a corporate talent pool is a two-stage decision process in which mostly experience-based (on-line) performance appraisal evaluations are used as an input in largely cognition-based (off-line) managerial decision making. Consequently, talent pool inclusion is determined not only by performance appraisal evaluations, but also a number of factors that influence the decision making in the second stage of the talent identification process. Using empirical insights from an in-depth case study as illustrations, we identify three such factors cultural and institutional distance between the locations of a potential member of the talent pool and the decision makers; homophily between the individual and the decision makers: and the network position of the person in question.

"In this article, the authors introduce attitude toward global products (AGP) and attitude toward local products (ALP) as generalized attitudinal constructs and address the four issues these constructs raise: (1) How are AGP and ALP related to each other? (2) What is the motivational structure underlying AGP and ALP? (3) Is the proposed theory culturally circumscribed, or does it generalize across countries? and (4) What are the managerially relevant implications of these consumer attitudes? To answer these questions, the authors propose and empirically test an integrated structure for AGP and ALP and their antecedents, organized around the powerful motivational concept of values. They test their theory using a unique data set involving 13,000 respondents from 28 countries in the Americas, Asia, and Europe, thus allowing for a global investigation of a global issue.

"In an effort to build long-term, profitable relationships, many companies systematically engage in multichannel relational communication-personalized messages sent to existing customers through various channels as part of a broader relationship marketing strategy. In this research, the authors examine three key drivers of relational communication effectiveness: volume of communication, mix of communication channels, and alignment of those channels with customers' preferences. They hypothesize that customer response to relational communication follows a continuum in which reciprocity explains response to lower levels of communication, the classic ideal point describes a transition phase, and reactance explains response to higher levels of communication. They empirically test the theoretical framework by examining the impact of multichannel communication on repurchase over a three-year period. The results indicate that after the ideal level of communication is exceeded, customers react negatively. This negative response can be exacerbated by the use of multiple channels but attenuated by aligning channels with customer preferences. The findings suggest that the complex effects of multichannel communication can actually drive customers away from rather than closer to a company.","['multichannel relational communication', 'ideal point', 'reactance', 'reciprocity', 'customer repurchase', 'CONSUMER', 'REACTANCE', 'REPETITION', 'REGRESSION', 'RETENTION', 'SELECTION', 'IMPACT']","['multichannel relational communication', 'ideal point', 'reactance', 'reciprocity', 'reactance', 'impact']","['reciprocity', 'reactance']",1.0,0.3333333333333333
"This paper studies the link between firm-level predicaments in high-technology start-ups and collective, cluster-level dynamics in early-stage peripheral locations. We investigate, first, the manner in which high-technology start-ups in early stage peripheral clusters accumulate and utilize resources; second, ways in which managers in start-up businesses and public sector officials work around inadequacies in order to move forward clusters composed mostly of high-technology start-ups; and third, the influence of such experiences on the development of clusters. Empirical findings from three IT clusters in Vietnam reveal resource inadequacies, private sector actors' inability to resolve such shortcomings, entrepreneurial passivity, risk aversion, and lack of confidence in governmental initiatives.

"This paper investigates the impact of institutional quality on the productivity, profitability and survival of new entrants versus those of incumbent firms in a transitional setting, Vietnam. By integrating economic and institutional perspectives, we emphasize the importance of institutional quality in shaping the evolution of industry dynamics. We find that poor institutional quality that acts as institutional buffering for incumbents jeopardizes the Schumpeterian market selection process. In particular, despite being more productive and profitable, new entrants are still more likely to exit than incumbents on average. As a consequence, facing poor institutions, only new entrants with sufficiently high productivity and profitability are able to survive. However, improving institutional quality does not enhance new entrants' survival and entrepreneurial performance; rather, it removes the survival advantage of incumbents and thus reduces the differences in performance and exit hazard between new entrants and incumbents. We investigate this seemingly paradoxical relationship using Vietnamese census data from 2006 to 2013.","['Institutional quality', 'Industry dynamics', 'Industry evolution', 'Industry variation', 'New entrants', 'Incumbents', 'Productivity', 'Entrepreneurial performance', 'Exit hazards', 'SUB-NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS', 'FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL DYNAMICS', 'MANUFACTURING FIRMS', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'LIFE-CYCLE', 'PANEL-DATA', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'GROWTH']","['institutional quality', 'industry dynamics', 'new entrants', 'incumbents', 'productivity', 'entrepreneurial performance', 'productivity']","['institutional quality', 'firms', 'vietnam', 'schumpeterian market', 'entrepreneurial performance']",0.4,0.2857142857142857
"This research investigates the interaction between a very common task, explaining decisions, and an individual difference, need for uniqueness (NFU), on buyer decision making. We propose that explaining (or providing reasons for) decisions shifts the focus from the choice of options to the choice of reasons. Furthermore, buyers who explain their decisions and have high NFU tend to select unconventional reasons and are, consequently, more likely to make unconventional choices. These predictions were supported in a series of studies involving choices between conventional and less-conventional options, such as whether to switch to a brand on sale, whether to select a compromise option, and whether to accept a gamble with a possible loss. The findings also indicate that the effects of providing reasons are not due to attempts to act rationally or to concerns about being evaluated. Three boundary conditions on the generalization that high NFU consumers who provide reasons tend to make unconventional choices were examined, all involving forces that promote conformity over uniqueness. They include evaluation by others, explicit information about the preferences of others, and negative feedback on previous decision performance. We discuss the implications of this research with respect to the roles of explanations, NFU, and accountability in buyer decision making.","['nan', 'VARIETY-SEEKING BEHAVIOR', 'ACCOUNTABILITY', 'PREFERENCE', 'ALTERNATIVES', 'POLARIZATION', 'ATTRACTION', 'JUDGMENTS', 'AVERSION', 'QUALITY', 'TIME']","['accountability', 'preference']","['uniqueness', 'decision making']",0.0,0.0
"Two-way asymmetric information frequently hampers performances of manufacturer-retailer distribution channel members. Typically, the manufacturer is better informed about the quality of his product than the retailer while the latter knows more about her consumers' preference for product quality than the manufacturer. Bridging these information gaps can enable more profitable channel (wholesale and retail) pricing decisions. Specifically, once the manufacturer knows his product quality, he can at some cost advertise it to the downstream retailer and her consumers. Similarly, the retailer can decide to conduct market research at some cost to more precisely determine her consumers' preference for product quality and share her finding with the manufacturer. In this paper, the authors examine the strategic impacts of two alternative timings of these information gap-filling decisions: In the Upfront Market Research (UMR) scenario, the retailer moves first with her market research decision and then the manufacturer makes his product quality advertising decision. Alternatively, in the Upfront Quality Advertising (UQA) scenario, the manufacturer first decides about product quality advertising and then the retailer proceeds with her market research decision. This paper analytically investigates and compares the strategic impacts of the UMR and UQA scenarios on the firms' equilibrium information strategies and payoffs in a two-way asymmetric information setting for the first time. The authors find that the retailer is always better off in the UQA than the UMR scenario while the manufacturer can find either UMR or UQA decision sequence more beneficial depending on the relative costs of market research and product quality advertising. The analyses offer new insights and guidelines for more efficient and profitable information acquisition and coordination in bilateral manufacturer-retailer channels. (C) 2019 New York University.

"Choice confidence is affected by fluency and moderated by construal levels that evoke different theories to interpret the feelings of fluency. At lower construal levels, fluency informs the feasibility of completing the concrete steps of the decision process to choose well, but at higher construal levels, fluency informs (insufficient) effort invested for the desirability of the outcome. We manipulated fluency by varying the font of product descriptions or the number of thoughts we asked participants to recall. Our studies showed that fluency increased confidence for people processing at lower construal levels but decreased confidence for those processing at higher construal levels. Construal level does not affect the persuasiveness of consumers' thoughts, supporting the hypothesis that it is the interpretation of fluency experienced during judgment, not the thought content, that leads to the moderating effects of construal level.","['nan', 'ATTITUDE CERTAINTY', 'SELF-VALIDATION', 'INFORMATION', 'AVAILABILITY', 'PERSUASION', 'JUDGMENT', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'EXPERIENCE', 'RESISTANCE', 'PREFERENCE']","['judgment', 'experience']",['choice confidence'],0.0,0.0
"Renewed interest in the resource-based theory of the firm has focused attention on the role of heterogeneous organizational 'competence' in competition. This paper attempts to measure the importance of these effects in the context of pharmaceutical research. We distinguish between 'component' and 'architectural' competence, and using internal firm data at the program level from 10 major pharmaceutical companies show that together the two forms of competence appear to explain a significant fraction of the variance in research productivity across firms. Our results raise some intriguing questions about the nature of competencies and the ways in which they diffuse over time.","['FIRM EFFECTS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL COMPETENCE', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'INDUSTRY', 'CAPABILITIES', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'PATENTS', 'MODELS', 'MATTER']",['organizational competence'],"['resource based theory', 'firm']",0.0,0.0
"The study by Khavul, Bruton, and Wood was an attempt to shed light on informal family businesses in East Africa, a group seldom studied. By applying the tenets of grounded theory the authors were able to successfully provide some insight into family business in this region. This commentary provides insight into the research by discussing the findings in light of the three-dimensional model of family business and attempts to limit agency costs based on cultural-based rights of the extended family. Also discussed here is a finding that may indicate a gender-related issue in opportunity identification and exploitation.","['nan', 'CONCEPTUAL ISSUES', 'AGENCY COSTS', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'FIRMS']",['agency costs'],[],0,0.0
"The authors build a model of global brand attitude and purchase likelihood with a nomological net comprised of constructs derived from three theoretical streams in consumer behavior: consumer culture theory, signaling theory, and the associative network memory model. By integrating these diverse theories, the authors provide a conceptual framework, explaining the processes leading to consumers' attitudes toward and likelihood of purchasing global brands. Global brand authenticity cultural capital, and perceived brand globalness are constructs based mainly on consumer culture theory, and global brand credibility is borrowed from signaling theory. Global brand quality, social responsibility, prestige, and relative price are included as brand associations, deriving mainly from the associative network memory model. These constructs have direct and indirect effects on global brand attitude and global brand purchase likelihood, reflecting the three-dimensional belief-attitude-behavior model in consumer behavior. The authors also introduce self-construal and cosmopolitanism as two pertinent moderators of some of the model paths.","['consumer culture theory', 'signaling theory', 'associative network memory model', 'global brand purchase likelihood', 'perceived brand globalness', 'CONSUMER ATTITUDES', 'CULTURE', 'SELF', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'CONSUMPTION', 'MEANINGS', 'ORIGIN', 'ETHNOCENTRISM', 'GLOBALIZATION', 'AUTHENTICITY']","['consumer culture theory', 'signaling theory', 'associative network memory model', 'global brand purchase likelihood', 'perceived brand globalness', 'culture', 'self', 'authenticity']",['cosmopolitanism'],0.0,0.0
"This paper presents the findings from an]ESRC two-year research project about Hoshin Kanri (policy management). Hoshin Kanri:is a form of corporate-wide management that combines strategic management and operational management by linking the achievement of top management goals with daily management at an operation level. The research explored practice in real time in three Japanese manufacturing UK-based subsidiaries. This paper consists of: an introductory review of the Hoshin Kanri and Japanization literature; a description of the research and a presentation of the three case studies and the main specific issues; and a discussion of the model and the parts played by lean working and TQM, catchball and nemawashi, strategic management, and the uniqueness of Hoshin Kanri, especially in relation to conventional planning, MBO (management by objectives), and the balanced scorecard. Hoshin Kanri is found to be an organizing framework for policy-based objectives. These are translated into QCDE (quality, cost, delivery, education) targets which are used in daily management to drive progress. Hoshin Kanri employs a participative approach to developing and deploying objectives, and is driven by a process of review. Hoshin Kanri must be managed as a process. Some of the main issues include changes in organization and personnel, problems with administering periodic review, and cross-functional working in departmental forms of organization.","['nan', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'STRATEGY']",['top management'],['japanization'],0.0,0.0
"This paper examines interfirm knowledge transfers within strategic alliances. Using a new measure of changes in alliance partners' technological capabilities based on the citation patterns of their patent portfolios, we analyze changes in the extent to which partner firms' technological resources 'overlap' as a result of alliance participation. This measure allows us to test hypotheses from the literature on interfirm knowledge transfer in alliances, with interesting results: we find support for some elements of this 'received wisdom'-equity arrangements promote greater knowledge transfer, and 'absorptive capacity' helps explain the extent of technological capability transfer at least in some alliances. But the results also suggest limits to the 'capabilities acquisition' view of strategic alliances Consistent with the argument that alliance activity can promote increased specialization, we find that the capabilities of partner firms become more divergent in a substantial subset of alliances.","['alliances', 'patents', 'technology transfer', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'INDUSTRY', 'FIRMS']","['alliances', 'firms']","['knowledge', 'strategic alliances', 'capabilities', 'absorptive capacity']",0.0,0.0
"Financial advisors seek to accurately measure individuals' risk preferences and provide sound personalized investment advice. Both advice tasks are increasingly offered through automated online technologies. Little is known, however, about what drives individuals' acceptance of such automated financial advice and, from a consumer point of view, which firms may be best positioned to provide such advice. We generate novel insights on these questions by conducting a real-world empirical study using an interactive automated online tool that employs an innovative computer algorithm to build pension investment profiles, the Pension Builder, and a large, representative sample. We focus on the role that two key firm characteristics have on consumer acceptance of pension investment advice generated by computer algorithms running on automated interactive online tools: profit orientation and role in the sales channel. We find that consumers' perceptions of trust and expertise of the firm providing the automated advice are important drivers of advice acceptance (besides a strong impact of the satisfaction with the consumer-online tool interaction), and that these constructs themselves are clearly influenced by the for-profit vs. not-for-profit orientation and the product provider vs. advisor only role in the sales channel of the firm providing the advice. We discuss the implications of our findings for marketers and policy makers and provide suggestions for future research.

"The Swedish government gathers information that helps identify family-owned businesses and enabled the authors to analyze every business in the economy over a longer period than has heretofore been reported. Using these data, the authors found that family-owned businesses account for up to one fourth of total employment and one fifth of gross domestic product in Sweden. These shares have increased over time due, in part, to economic policy. The authors compare their findings with other studies and suggest how Sweden and other governments might make family firm data more readily available for researchers.","['family firms', 'employment', 'GDP', 'Sweden', 'ownership', 'OWNERSHIP', 'CORPORATIONS', 'EVOLUTION']","['employment', 'sweden']",[],0,0.0
"Granting of exclusive rights is an important consideration for firms using licensing as a mode of entry into foreign markets, as exclusive contracts reduce licensors' flexibility in a given market during the term of the agreement. By granting exclusivity to a licensee with greater technological potential, the exchange partners can increase the potential transactional value of the licensing agreement. At the same time, a licensee with strong technological potential will increase the threat of transactional hazards due to underinvestment and rent appropriation. In this paper, we develop and empirically test a model that evaluates the balancing of transactional value and transaction costs in exclusive licensing. In particular, we identify the conditions under which exclusive contracts are likely to be granted to foreign licensees with strong technological potential. Empirical results from a multilevel model, based on 375 international licensing agreements of US firms in high-technology industries during 1995-2008, show that licensees with a stronger technological potential are more likely to be granted exclusive rights in countries with strong intellectual property rights protection, and in industries with a high rate of technological change; but are less likely to be granted exclusive rights when there is a high degree of overlap between licensor and licensee products.","['transaction cost analysis', 'transactional value', 'inter-organizational licensing', 'licensing exclusivity', 'intellectual property rights', 'multilevel model', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'PARTNER SELECTION', 'PATENT PROTECTION', 'TRANSACTION COST', 'FOREIGN ENTRY', 'REAL OPTIONS', 'FIRM', 'MARKET']","['transactional value', 'intellectual property rights', 'multilevel model', 'intellectual property rights', 'transaction cost', 'firm', 'market']","['exclusive rights', 'underinvestment', 'intellectual property rights', 'products']",0.25,0.14285714285714285
"Purpose - This paper aims to explore the factors of quality control (QC) among key members of a supply chain and investigate the effect on supply chain management (SCM). Design/methodology/approach - This research employs a case study approach of five firms in the fresh fruit and vegetable supply chain in Jordan. Cases are first analysed individually. Then a cross-analysis supplemented with archival material and non-participant observation is made. A questionnaire is also conducted in order to analyse the effect of QC on SCM. Findings - The findings identify the high-order factors of QC and demonstrate the role of QC in SCM, acting as the main strategy to improve supply chains. Practical implications - The case studies draw on the experiences and views of supply chain members in order to improve the understanding of the role of QC in SCM. The proposed conceptual framework can help managers in understanding the factors of supply chain QC. Originality/value - This is one of only a few studies that examine QC in the supply chain. It is also one of only a few research studies to provide empirical evidence of the role of QC in SCM for the fruit and vegetable industry.","['Supply chain management', 'Quality control', 'Exports', 'Fruit and vegetable industry', 'Jordan', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'FORMAL CONTRACTS', 'BUSINESS', 'SYSTEM', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'COMMITMENT', 'GOVERNANCE', 'EXPORT', 'TRADE']","['supply chain management', 'quality control', 'fruit and vegetable industry', 'jordan']","['quality control', 'supply chain management', 'case study', 'jordan', 'fruit and', 'industry']",0.5,0.75
"The dynamics of the world economy and global competition patterns are encouraging multinational enterprises (MNEs) to expand into emerging economies. This study validates the proposition that entry mode selection in an emerging economy is influenced by situational contingencies at four levels: nation, industry; firm, and project. Analysis of data collected from China suggests that the joint venture is preferred when perceived governmental intervention or environmental uncertainty is high or host country experience is low. The wholly-owned entry mode is preferred when intellectual property rights are not well protected, the number of firms in the industry is growing fast, the need for global integration is high, or the project is located in an open economic region. The importance of these multilevel determinants requires simultaneous and inseparable considerations of the risk, return, control, and resource effects of the entry mode decision. This necessitates a theoretical integration of multiple perspectives such as transaction cost, the eclectic paradigm, bargaining power, and organizational capability.","['nan', 'INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES', 'TRANSACTION COST', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'BARGAINING POWER', 'ECLECTIC THEORY', 'EMPIRICAL-TEST', 'FOREIGN ENTRY', 'CHOICE', 'MODE', 'CHINA']","['transaction cost', 'bargaining power', 'mode', 'china']",[],0,0.0
"The literature examining the effect of sales control on salesperson performance is, at best, equivocal. To reconcile inconsistencies in empirical findings, this research introduces two new types of salesperson learning: exploratory and exploitative learning. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, the authors conceptualize exploratory learning as promotion focused and exploitative learning as prevention focused and find that salespeople exhibit both exploratory and exploitative learning, though one is used more than the other depending on the type of sales control employed. The results also suggest that the fit between salesperson learning type, customer characteristics (i.e., purchase-decision-making complexity), and salesperson characteristics (i.e., preference for sales predictability) is critical to salesperson performance and that salesperson learning mediates the relationship between sales control and salesperson performance (Study 1). Study 2 corroborates the findings using new panel data collected over two waves.

"Research summary: This article examines the role of competitive shocks in creating opportunities for new firm foundings. I argue that the sudden dissolution of rival firms may release resources that create opportunities for firm formation, particularly among employees facing impediments to capturing value in their current organizations. Analyzing microdata from the legal services industry, I use unexpected deaths of solo-practicing attorneys as quasi-exogenous sources of rival dissolution. Results indicate that these shocks increase the odds of founding by about 30%, with stronger effects among attorneys with weaker social connections or higher competition for promotion. The article thus highlights the role that founders play in reallocating dissolved rivals' resources while demonstrating that founding may be an important outlet for blocked employees to capture value from opportunities. Managerial summary: This article finds that the shutdown and dissolution of a rival organization may spur employees to found new firms. As a consequence, managers may find it valuable to pay attention to employees' turnover intentions following the dissolution of a rival. Findings suggest that employees who are having trouble advancing in the firm may be the most likely to found a new organization when a rival dissolves, so managers may want to focus retention efforts on these individuals. To the extent that managers wish to capture customers, employees, and other resources that were formerly attached to a dissolved rival, managers may wish to be aware that they could be in competition with their own employees for these resources and opportunities.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the development of a methodology to evaluate suppliers using portfolio analysis based on the analytical network process (ANP) and environmental factors. Design/methodology/approach - The authors develop a three-step process, first by evaluating influence/power and performance scores of suppliers using ANP. They include environmental dimensions in this analysis, then map these suppliers onto a portfolio grid. Recommendations are also made on how to manage suppliers depending on what part of the portfolio they appear based on the scores. Findings - The technique is useful and versatile. The paper clearly discerns various characteristics of the suppliers and produced recommendations on supplier management for an exemplary case scenario. Research limitations/implications - The technique was applied for an illustrative example. Validation and application in a real world setting is required. There are many additional opportunities to further integrate other modeling tools into this process. Practical implications - Managers can use this technique to help them more effectively deal with suppliers. The portfolio is a good tool for operational and strategic management of suppliers. Originality/value - This tool is the first to apply ANP to supplier portfolio analysis. It is also the first tool to integrate and apply the portfolio supplier management approach to an environmentally oriented decision environment.","['Supplier relations', 'Environmental management', 'Analytical hierarchy process', 'Green marketing', 'Benchmarking', 'CHAIN MANAGEMENT', 'ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA', 'CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK', 'SELECTION', 'SUSTAINABILITY', 'MODEL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PRESSURES', 'INDUSTRY', 'POWER']","['model', 'performance', 'power']","['portfolio analysis', 'analytical network process', 'environmental', 'influence power', 'performance', 'supplier management', 'portfolio', 'supplier management']",0.125,0.3333333333333333
"Based on a sample of 522 foreign affiliates of Turkish multinational enterprises (MNEs) with varying levels of Turkish equity ownership, this study provides an empirical analysis of the determinants of equity-based entry mode strategies in host country markets. A number of hypotheses are developed to examine the impact of institutional, transaction specific and firm level variables on Turkish MNEs' choice of equity ownership mode in their foreign affiliates. The results reveal that institutional variables are important in explaining the equity composition of foreign affiliates of Turkish MNEs. Particularly important in determining equity ownership mode were found to be political constraints, linguistic distance, knowledge infrastructure and the extent of parent diversity. Results concerning the influences of the size of the affiliate are contrary to expectations and contradict the findings of previous research. No support was found for the impact of Cultural distance on the equity ownership mode of Turkish MNEs in their foreign affiliates. Apart from political constraints, equity ownership choice and its underlying determinants do not vary between emerging and developed host country markets. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The selection process is driven by the price, delivery, and quality objectives of the buyer and subject to the capacity constraints of the vendors. In this context, the vendors offer discounts on total amount of sales volumes not on the quantity or variety of products purchased from them.

"The measurement of corporate performance is central to strategic management research. A common objective of this research is to identify top performers in an industry and their sources of competitive advantage. Despite this focus on best firms and practices, most researchers utilize statistical methods that identify average effects in a sample, and they assess a single performance dimension while ignoring other relevant dimensions. Emphasis on purely financial measures can overlook the fact that a firm's efficiency in transforming resources has been shown as a major source of competitive advantage. In this article we demonstrate how frontier methodologies, such as Data Envelopment Analysis and the Stochastic Frontier approach, can address these challenges.

"Strategic management theories invoke the concept of competitive advantage to explain firm performance, and empirical research investigates competitive advantage and describes how it operates. But as a performance hypothesis, competitive advantage has received surprisingly little formal justification, particularly in light of its centrality in strategy research and practice. As it happens, the core hypothesis-that competitive advantage produces sustained superior performance-finds little support informal deductive or inductive inference, and the leading theories of competitive advantage incorporate refutation barriers that preclude meaningful empirical tests.

"This study examined how individuals do boundary work, the process of negotiating, setting, moving, and adjusting boundaries between work and life outside of work. In an inductive qualitative study of 70 attorneys in a large US law firm, I found that boundary work cannot be fully understood without considering the relationships within which it happens. Attorneys engaged in different types of boundary work in different types of relationships that activated either approach or avoidance motivation to pursue substantive (i.e., boundary-related) and relational goals. Boundary work led to measurable and predictable outcomes-success in boundary setting and impact on relationships-that depended on the nature of relationships and the type of boundary work used.

"Acquisition of new customers involves both opportunity and risk, and it is important for firms to predict and manage the risks involved in customer acquisition. Despite its importance, the management of customer acquisition risk has not been the subject of much academic research. This paper develops a framework for firms to manage customer acquisition risk using co-operative databases. We illustrate this framework in the context of the optimal selection of customers for direct mail with a 'buy now, pay later' payment option when the acquisition risk manifests as bad debt risk. Using data from a large scale direct marketing campaign, we show that our empirical model that incorporates bad debt risk substantially outperfonns suboptimal targeting schemes that overlook bad debt risk. We also demonstrate how alleviating bad debt risk is one beneficial outcome of a fairly recent trend in database marketing, namely the emergence of co-operative databases.

"The success of online advertising depends on the degree of customer acceptance and corresponding click-through rate (CTR). The coverage of traditional online advertising is wide, but the CTR of display advertisements delivered by firms is relatively lower. Whereas targeted advertising can deliver appropriate advertisements to customers based on their traits (disturbance avoidance), advertisements can leverage the power of social influence to improve the degree of acceptance of advertisements. In this paper, by utilizing the power of social influence and context embellishment, we propose a personalized social context endorsement mechanism to enhance the effectiveness of advertisements. According to the results of an experiment conducted on Facebook, the proposed mechanism outperforms other benchmark approaches to improving the CTR and user impressions.

"Marketers want to encourage constituents to strongly identify with their organizations, because organizational identification contributes to positive firm outcomes. However, the extant research on organizational identity largely has overlooked the fact that an individual's self actually is a collection of multiple social identities. This study is the first to propose and empirically demonstrate that marketers can leverage customers' multiple societal roles (e.g., parent, environmentalist, professor) to build and reinforce their relationships with the firm. Specifically, the research introduces the concept of identity synergy. Identity synergy occurs when individuals' involvement with an organization facilitates their pursuit of other important social identities. Our study shows that customer perception of identity synergy is positively related to identification with an organization. Moreover, the study helps explain the process by which antecedents of organizational identity (identity affirmation, identity support, and value congruence) positively affect customer-firm relationships by proposing and testing identity synergy as a mediator between these antecedents and organizational identification. The study also contributes to our understanding of organizational identity theory by introducing the new concept of peer identification, or identification with other members of the organization, such as other customers or volunteers. The empirical evidence demonstrates identity synergy's role in building peer identification, as well as peer identification's role in building organizational identification.","['Organizational identification', 'Peer identification', 'Multiple identities', 'Identity synergy', 'WORK-FAMILY CONFLICT', 'COMPANY IDENTIFICATION', 'PERSON-ORGANIZATION', 'SELF', 'COMMITMENT', 'MODEL', 'VALUES', 'FIT', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'AFFIRMATION']","['organizational identification', 'peer identification', 'identity synergy', 'self', 'affirmation']",['organizational identification'],1.0,0.2
"The results of four studies examining the effect of mood on the learning of brand names show that a positive mood enhances the learning of brand names in relation to a neutral mood.

Results also suggest that mood can affect the rehearsal of the specific brand names. These findings add to the growing evidence that mood affects the strategies used to process information and demonstrate for the first time that mood affects brand rehearsal as well as relational elaboration.

In a field study of 220 retail store units, we found evidence supporting social identity theory and information-based perspectives on the racial diversity congruence-sales performance relationship. Specifically, results show that a match between store-unit racial diversity and community racial diversity positively related to store-unit sales performance. In addition, superior store-unit performance emerged when store units and communities had congruent levels of diversity at high (i.e., high-high racial diversity congruence) rather than low (i.e., low-low racial diversity congruence) levels.

"Rapid technological developments in the computer and the telecommunications industries have spurred the introduction of technology-based products. An important feature of these products is that they can be characterized based on improvements in the functionality and the interface. When consumers evaluate a technology-based product, they face a trade-off: How should they choose between a product that offers a superior functionality and another product that offers a superior interface? The present research focuses on how temporal distance (i.e., time) from the purchase or use occasion of a technology-based innovation influences consumers' evaluations of the new product. Specifically, the present study examines how temporal distance affects the trade-offs consumers make between improvements in the interface and improvements in the functionality of a new product. This research demonstrates that the weight consumers place on the functionality and the interface of a new product is a function of the temporal distance.

"In multidimensional unfolding multidimensional scaling (MDS) procedures, the predicted utility of a brand for a consumer is inversely related to the distance between that consumer's ideal point and the brand position in the derived space. Most MDS models treat all brands the same regardless of their respective market share. In many product categories, however, consumer preferences are heavily influenced by the size of the existing market share (i.e., the brand mass). This article presents two versions of a new spatial methodology that incorporates the effects of brand as well as consumer mass via a spatial gravity model of consumer utility; that is, the attraction of a brand for a consumer depends not only on the distance of the brand from a consumer's ideal point but also on the current market size of the brand, as well as the consumer purchase pattern and volume. One version of the proposed model estimates brand positions and individual ideal points with two-way or three-way pick any/N binary choice data. The second version we develop provides the same spatial decomposition for two-way or three-way metric preference/dominance data. We also develop a series of nested MDS models to estimate, test, and compare four different model structures with respect to any common data set. We illustrate the proposed methodology using an actual commercial application involving physician prescription behavior and examine competing model fits.","['nan', 'BINARY CHOICE DATA', 'NETWORK EXTERNALITIES', 'THRESHOLD-MODEL', 'REPRESENTATION', 'INFORMATION', 'DECISIONS', 'EQUATION', 'PRODUCT', 'MARKET', 'TRADE']","['binary choice data', 'product', 'market']","['scaling', 'mass', 'spatial gravity model']",0.0,0.0

"Recent years have witnessed major changes in the global location of economic activity, with the emerging economies assuming greater shares relative to the advanced economies. These developments have led many authors to refer to the idea of the global factory. But little attention has been given to who has control over the geographically dispersed activities-or, to put it another way, about the governance of the global factory. Have the changes in the global location of economic activity come about primarily through the growth of locally owned firms in the emerging economies, or through increased FDI by MNEs from the advanced economies, or through the proliferation of outsourcing arrangements coordinated by firms in the advanced economies? These control/governance issues have profound implications for the capture of the profits/rents earned in global value chains, and hence for the global distribution of income. This paper explores these issues, and considers who has benefited most from the contemporary phase of globalization.","['nan', 'MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISES', 'INTERNATIONAL-TRADE', 'STRATEGY', 'GLOBALIZATION', 'RISE', 'FIRM', 'JOBS']","['globalization', 'firm']",['economies'],0.0,0.0
"Agency theory is the dominant explanation for entrepreneurs' decisions about how much to grow through franchising vis-a-vis company ownership. We introduce a resource-based explanation and submit that the proportion franchised is influenced by efforts to organize franchisor-owned and relational strategic assets so that their value can be best leveraged to meet key strategic goals. Using data from 168 franchisors, we found that relational (i.e., interfirm trust and knowledge-sharing routines), but not franchisor-owned (i.e., brand reputation and operating routines), strategic assets influence the proportion franchised. The study offers preliminary evidence that resource-based theory has merit as a complementary explanation for franchising.","['nan', 'FAMILIARITY BREED TRUST', 'AGENCY THEORY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL FORM', 'TRANSACTION COST', 'FIRM RESOURCES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'OPPORTUNISM', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'MANAGEMENT']","['agency theory', 'ownership']","['agency theory', 'resource based', 'assets', 'trust', 'resource based theory']",0.2,0.5

"We analyze performance and emotions as antecedents and consequences of team strategic decisions to explore a new routine versus exploiting an existing one. In a laboratory study, we examine team decision making over time and draw causal inferences about the relationships among team emotions, team performance, and explore-exploit decisions. We use self-report data to measure team emotions, and validate results with psychophysiological data. We find that declines in performance increase the likelihood that teams decide to explore new routines rather than exploit existing ones. We also find a marginal positive effect of positive emotions, as measured by both self-report and psychophysiological data, on team decisions to explore a new routine. Further, teams successful at implementing new routines report increased positive emotions, as measured by the self-report data. This relationship is fully mediated by performance change.

"Using the resource-based view of the firm, we examine how four key resource attributes affect performance. The relationship between resource attributes and performance is studied in the context of international joint ventures (IJVs), using data from 96 IJVs in Malaysia. Executives were asked to assess the extent to which four resources (product reputation, technical expertise, local business network and marketing skills) exhibited the following attributes: (1) value; (2) rarity; (3) imperfect imitability; (4) non-substitutability. For each resource, the relationships between these attribute ratings and performance were analyzed. We found that each of the four attributes had an influence on performance. Value, rarity, and non-substitutability were found to be significant drivers of performance for IJV assets. In contrast, value, rarity, and non-imitability were critical attributes for organizational capabilities. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

"How does international competition originating from low-wage countries affect domestic financing capacity of firms in high-wage countries? In this article, we use China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a quasi-natural experiment to investigate the effects of trade-induced competition originating from China on the price and design of bank-loan contracts for firms in US manufacturing industries. We find that the elevated level of Chinese import competition in the US, following China's WTO entry, is associated with a reduction in the overall cost of bank financing for import-competing US manufacturing firms, evidenced by lower spread, higher amount, longer maturity, and less restrictive non-price contract terms such as collateral and covenants. We show that such reduction in the external financing premiums of import-competing firms is the result of trade-induced productivity gains within firms and a reallocation of financing between firms towards more capital-intensive and technologically advanced firms. These results suggest that engaging in international business activities with a low-wage country via trade openness is likely to ease the provisions of external debt financing for firms in high-wage countries.","['globalization', 'import competition', 'cost of capital', 'China', 'TRADE LIBERALIZATION', 'INTERNATIONAL-TRADE', 'LIQUIDATION VALUES', 'MATURITY STRUCTURE', 'MARKET', 'FIRM', 'IMPACT', 'CREDIT', 'DETERMINANTS', 'GROWTH']","['import competition', 'china', 'firm']","['international competition', 'firms', 'china', 'productivity']",0.25,0.3333333333333333

"Historically, when targeting potential adopters of a new product, firms have tended to focus first on people with disproportional effect on others, often labeled opinion leaders. The authors highlight the benefit of targeting customers with high lifetime value (CLV), or revenue leaders. The authors argue that targeting revenue leaders can create high value both by accelerating adoption among these customers and because of the higher-than-average value that revenue leaders generate by affecting other customers with similarly high CLV. The latter phenomenon is driven by network assortativity, whereby people's social networks tend to be composed of others who are similar to themselves. Analyzing an agent-based model of a seeding program for a new product, the authors contrast revenue leader seeding with opinion leader seeding and compare the factors that influence the effectiveness of each. They show that the distribution of CLV in the population and the seed size play a major role in determining which seeding approach is preferable, and they discuss the managerial implications of these findings.","['word of mouth', 'opinion leaders', 'assortativity', 'customer lifetime value', 'agent-based models', 'CUSTOMER EQUITY', 'DIFFUSION', 'PROGRAMS', 'ACCELERATION', 'INFLUENTIALS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'NETWORKS', 'FRIENDS', 'IMPACT', 'POWER']","['opinion leaders', 'assortativity', 'networks']","['lifetime value', 'network assortativity', 'social networks', 'model', 'findings']",0.0,0.0

We conclude by discussing the influence of organizational context on religious identity salience and the need for innovative and interdisciplinary empirical research on religion and ethical behavior in organizations.","['nan', 'UNETHICAL DECISION BEHAVIOR', 'POLITICAL-BEHAVIOR', 'BUSINESS ETHICS', 'UNITED-STATES', 'ROLE-IDENTITY', 'ORIENTATION', 'RELIGIOUSNESS', 'MODEL', 'RATIONALITY', 'PERFORMANCE']",['orientation'],['self'],0.0,0.0

"Loyalty programmes (LPs) have increased in number and popularity, but their effects on customer behaviour remain equivocal, due to a lack of understanding of the drivers of LP effectiveness and insufficient generalizable conclusions across prior studies. This paper synthesizes current knowledge pertaining to LPs, reconciles opposing findings by exploring the conditions that mediate and moderate the effects of LP participation on consumer responses, and charts important avenues for research. Overall, we find that LPs are effective in increasing consumer purchase behaviours over time, but the impact differs across consumer segments and markets. Currently, neither firms nor consumers fully benefit from the opportunities that LPs offer. To that end, we identify aspects which help researchers and practitioners increase their understanding of LP benefits and pitfalls. Through this study, companies that already have LPs will be able to improve their performance, and those that are about to introduce one will better understand the implications of the LP launch.","['nan', 'CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT', 'REWARD PROGRAMS', 'SWITCHING COSTS', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'PURCHASE BEHAVIOR', 'TESCO CLUBCARD', 'BRAND CHOICE', 'IMPACT', 'SHARE', 'SATISFACTION']",['impact'],"['loyalty programmes', 'performance']",0.0,0.0
"There are arguments to support and contradict the proposition that foreign-owned and U.S.-owned establishments exhibit similar location patterns within the United States. This paper addresses these conflicting views by comparing the location of all manufacturing establishments in the United States held by U.S. and by foreign firms. The empirical evidence indicates that the location patterns of foreign-owned and U.S.-owned establishments differ. Moreover, the most influential factor in explaining the location pattern difference is that foreign-owned establishments, compared to U.S.-owned establishments, favor coastal states. I also find evidence to suggest that foreign firms favor states with low unionization rates,low wage rates,and right to work legislation. These results are consistent with arguments that foreign establishments differ from their domestic counterparts and value location attributes differently.","['nan', 'UNITED-STATES', 'DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'SILICON VALLEY', 'AGGLOMERATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'MODEL', 'FIRM']","['united states', 'firm']",[],0,0.0
"Performance assessment of innovation projects is a central issue in innovation management research. Using existing literature, a model is developed to assess the performance of new product and new service development projects. In this model, project performance is defined as a combination of a formatively indicated operational performance construct and a reflectively indicated product performance construct. The validity of this model is tested based on a sample of 219 innovation projects assessed by innovation managers. Using only the innovation managers' responses, it is, however, not possible to distinguish between operational and product performance. The impact of common method bias and informant bias is subsequently assessed using a subsample of 128 of these 219 innovation projects that are assessed by the innovation manager and the project leader. These latter results show that operational and product performance are two distinct constructs. In addition, the multitrait-multimethod analyses show that especially the more abstract items of performance, such as the perceptions of quality, captured knowledge, competitive advantage, gained reputation, and customer satisfaction, suffer from random error and informant bias. Project leaders appear to be better informed to assess operational performance, while innovation managers are better in assessing product performance. The paper concludes with a qualitative comparison of several alternative performance models: the project performance model as derived from the literature, a similar (misspecified) reflective performance model, two stand-alone models in which operational and product performance are assessed separately, and a mixed model that uses a combination of innovation managers' and project managers' data. Based on this comparison, it is advised to use either the stand-alone models for operational performance and product performance or the mixed model whereby the project leader assesses operational performance and the innovation manager the product performance of an innovation project.","['nan', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SUCCESS', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'CAPABILITIES', 'INDICATORS', 'INDUSTRIAL', 'IMPACT', 'NPD']",['impact'],[],0,0.0
"Firm-level data from executives are necessary for testing many theories in organizational science. To date, researchers who have used survey methods to get data from executives have relied on response-rate techniques that were validated in general public, customer-, or employee-level populations. In a factorial field experiment, we manipulated the four most strongly supported of these techniques: incentives (gifts), advance notice, follow-up, and personalization. We also examined firm size as a potential moderator of their effects. In addition, we tested whether these response-rate enhancements affected the psychometric quality (acquiescence, self-presentation bias) of the executive survey data. Despite high statistical power (n = 1,200, 1 - beta greater than or equal to .95), none of the conventional response-rate enhancement techniques were effective. Small influences on response acquiescence were found but these were confined to questions that arguably had the strongest demand cites. We conclude that distinctly different techniques may be needed to generate interest and involvement among executives targeted by firm-level mail surveys, and it,e provide some suggestions.

"Although there is significant evidence that customer satisfaction is an important driver of firm profitability, extant literature has largely neglected two intermediate outcomes of customer satisfaction, namely, a firm's advertising and promotion efficiency and its human capital performance. On the basis of longitudinal analyses of large-scale secondary data from multiple sources, the authors find that customer satisfaction boosts the efficiency of future advertising and promotion investments. This finding can be explained by the possibility that customer satisfaction generates free word-of-mouth advertising and saves subsequent marketing costs. In addition, customer satisfaction has a positive influence on a company's excellence in human capital (employee talent and manager superiority). This finding is highly novel, indicating that human resources managers should have a strong interest in customer satisfaction as well. Finally, the authors investigate the moderating influence of market concentration on both relationships. The uncovered results have important implications for marketers in their dialogue with financial executives and human resources managers.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'WORD-OF-MOUTH', 'CONSUMER SATISFACTION', 'SATISFIED CUSTOMERS', 'PERCEIVED RISK', 'DYNAMIC-MODEL', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'LOYALTY', 'IMPACT']",['word of mouth'],"['customer satisfaction', 'advertising', 'promotion efficiency', 'performance', 'word of mouth']",0.2,1.0
"How does the presence of 'controlled' foreign firms affect the productivity of domestic firms in the same industry? We revisit the historical distinction betweencontrolandinfluenceby the foreign owner and define 'controlled' foreign firms as those with a foreign ultimate owner holding 50% or more of voting shares. Connecting insights from new internalization theory with knowledge-based views of the MNE, we posit that 'controlled' foreign firms will generate larger productivity spillovers than non-controlled foreign firms. We use a firm-level panel dataset of 575,844 manufacturing firms (2,343,495 observations) across 20 European countries to test our proposition. We pay careful attention to how firms are categorized as foreign, taking into account both direct andindirectownership links. Allowing for indirect ownership turns out to be pivotal: there are just as many indirectly controlled foreign firms as foreign firms captured with direct ownership data. We find positive horizontal spillovers from controlled foreign firms and zero spillovers from non-controlled foreign firms. Interestingly, the strongest positive spillovers come from the indirectly controlled foreign firms. The implications of our study extend beyond productivity spillovers to areas such as cross-border M&As, joint ventures, MNE strategies of legitimation, and corporate groups.","['foreign direct investment', 'knowledge and productivity spillovers', 'ultimate owner', 'new internalization theory', 'paradox of control', 'history of FDI and the MNE', 'INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER', 'INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS', 'DOMESTIC FIRMS EVIDENCE', 'DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISES', 'EMERGING MARKET', 'FDI SPILLOVERS', 'POSITIVE SPILLOVERS', 'EVOLUTIONARY-THEORY', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['ultimate owner', 'new internalization theory', 'positive spillovers', 'knowledge']","['foreign firms', 'internalization theory', 'productivity spillovers', 'joint ventures']",0.0,0.0

"Applying grounded theory, we comprehensively categorize capabilities needed for market-shaping and synthesize them into a conceptual framework that describes the process and its outcomes. We establish that in order to improve value creation in a market, market-shapers must consider a larger system of relevant stakeholders, recognize the institutional arrangements governing their behaviors, and foster new resource linkages within and across stakeholders. Based on our analysis, we identify eight triggering capabilities, which generate new intra- and inter-stakeholder resource linkages by directly influencing various characteristics of the market, and four facilitating capabilities, which enable market-shaping by discovering the value potential of new resource linkages and augment the impact of the triggering capabilities by mobilizing relevant resources. We show that triggering capabilities are context-specific, whereas facilitating capabilities are generic.

"The price people are willing to pay for a good is often less than the price they are willing to accept to give up the same good, a phenomenon called the endowment effect. Loss aversion has typically accounted for the endowment effect, but an alternative explanation suggests that ownership creates an association between the item and the self, and this possession-self link increases the value of the good. To test the ownership account, this research examines three moderators that theory suggests should affect the possession-self link and consequently the endowment effect: self-threat, identity associations of a good, and gender. After a social self-threat, the endowment effect is strengthened for in-group goods among both men and women but is eliminated for out-group goods among men (but not women). These results are consistent with a possession-self link explanation and therefore suggest that ownership offers a better explanation for the endowment effect.","['nan', 'RELATIONSHIP NORMS', 'MERE OWNERSHIP', 'LOSS AVERSION', 'SOCIAL SELF', 'OUT-GROUPS', 'POSSESSIONS', 'SALIENCE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'ESTEEM', 'AGENCY']","['loss aversion', 'social self']",['women'],0.0,0.0
"Research has focused predominantly on the influence of the language firms use in their announcements on the reactions of constituents such as shareholders and the media. We extend this research by examining a new form of linguistic construction-temporal framing-in the context of competitive interactions. Building on intertemporal choice theory, we theorized and tested how a focal firm's temporal framing of its competitive action announcements affects rivals' response speed. We examined three dimensions of temporal framing: temporal vagueness (lack of clarity and completeness regarding timelines), temporal distance (length of the action timeline: proximal versus distal), and frequency (repetition of vagueness and distance cues). Based on analysis of 2,130 competitive action press releases of 28 duopoly firms from 14 industries, we found that the temporal framing dimensions, both individually and interactively, were related to the response speed of rivals. Specifically, temporally vague and distally framed timelines in action announcements delayed rivals' response speed, and increased frequency of vagueness and distance cues strengthened these effects. This study explicates the linguistic underpinnings of competitive interactions and highlights the importance of temporal framing in the competitive context.","['nan', 'CONSTRUAL-LEVEL THEORY', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'INTERPERSONAL INFLUENCE', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE', 'INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE', 'MARKET', 'MEDIA', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'INFORMATION', 'MANAGEMENT']","['intertemporal choice', 'media']","['temporal framing', 'choice', 'response speed', 'context']",0.0,0.0

"This paper challenges the prevalent notion that family-owned firms are more risk averse than publicly owned firms. Using behavioral theory, we argue that for family firms, the primary reference point is the loss of their socioemotional wealth, and to avoid those losses, family firms are willing to accept a significant risk to their performance; yet at the same time, they avoid risky business decisions that might aggravate that risk. Thus, we propose that the predictions of behavioral theory differ depending on family ownership. We confirm our hypotheses using a population of 1,237 family-owned olive oil mills in Southern Spain who faced the choice during a 54-year period of becoming a member of a cooperative, a decision associated with loss of family control but lower business risk, or remaining independent, which preserves the family's socioemotional wealth but greatly increases its performance hazard. As shown in this study, family firms may be risk willing and risk averse at the same time.","['nan', 'EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION', 'PROSPECT-THEORY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'AGENCY', 'RETURN', 'MANAGEMENT', 'STRATEGY', 'MODEL', 'COMPENSATION', 'PERSPECTIVES']",['performance'],"['behavioral theory', 'socioemotional wealth', 'decisions']",0.0,0.0

We also find that this U-shaped relationship is stronger for small firms that internationalize early.","['export', 'market exit', 'small firms', 'population ecology', 'internationalization', 'FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'CAPABILITIES PERSPECTIVE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL FAILURE', 'VENTURE PERFORMANCE', 'STRUCTURAL INERTIA', 'START-UP', 'SURVIVAL', 'ENTRY', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['export', 'market exit', 'small firms', 'entry']","['entry', 'export market exit', 'small firms']",0.6666666666666666,0.5
"From a narrative perspective, organizations' identities are discursive (linguistic) constructs constituted by the multiple identity-relevant narratives that their participants author about them, and which feature, for example, in documents, conversations and electronic media. By defining collective identities as the totality of such narratives I draw attention to their complex, and often fragmented and heterogeneous nature. My approach contrasts with much of the theorizing in this field which has tended to homogenize collective identities by emphasizing what is common or shared, failed to capture the interplay between different communities within organizations, and produced bland, undifferentiated empirical research. In particular, the theoretical framework that I outline focuses attention on the importance of reflexivity, voice, plurivocity, temporality, and fictionality to an understanding of collective identities as locales for competing hegemonic claims. In combination, these notions form a unique conceptual model for theorizing and researching collective identities. This said, a narrative approach also has its limitations, and is proposed as an additional, not exclusive, interpretive lens.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY', 'STORYTELLING ORGANIZATION', 'STORIES', 'CULTURE', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'RESPONSES', 'PARADIGM', 'SERVICE', 'IMAGE', 'WORK']",['work'],[],0,0.0
"Nonfamily CEOs are an important part of the managerial efforts of many family businesses. However, little academic work has focused on these managers, who reside in the dual worlds of business and family. This article presents a study based on interviews with 27 family members and nonfamily CEOs (NFCs) with the objective of exploring what makes for successful NFCs. We find that successful nonfamily CEO engagements are characterized by the selection of an individual with both business and interpersonal competencies, and the support of both family business boards and councils.","['nan', 'FAMILY FIRMS', 'AGENCY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'GOVERNANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'DIRECTORS', 'ALTRUISM', 'BOARDS']",['boards'],['nonfamily ceos'],0.0,0.0
"This research investigates the experience of systemic restricted choice and its impact on self-concept among racial and ethnic minority consumers seeking financing. Choosing loans is an involved consumer choice journey, and encountering systemic, chronic, and uncontrollable restrictions on choice at any level of the goal/choice hierarchy limits and even prohibits minorities' ability to make desired choices. Across a multimethod investigation, these three studies demonstrate that minorities experiencing systemic restricted choice endure deleterious impacts to self-concept, including framing the self as fettered, alone, discriminated, and subservient, as well as marked reductions in self-esteem, self-autonomy, and self-efficacy. Minority consumers also frame themselves as striving in a world of limited resources and fighting uphill, often losing battles. Juxtaposing the experiences of racial/ethnic minorities against the choice journeys of educationally and economically similar white consumers puts those minority experiences in sharp relief. The theoretical and transformative consumer research implications of these findings are discussed.","['nan', 'ESTEEM', 'DISCRIMINATION', 'IDENTITY', 'RACE', 'LIFE', 'COGNITION', 'MODELS', 'THREAT']",['esteem'],"['self', 'esteem self autonomy', 'self efficacy', 'consumer research']",0.0,0.0
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to profile the successful implementation of a corporate-wide supplier diversity program utilized by Caterpillar, Inc., one of the Fortune 500 companies. Caterpillar's supplier diversity program can be a blue-print for other companies which would like to accomplish the corporate mission of promoting the free enterprise system by prohibiting restraints of trade, unfair practices, reciprocity, or abuse of economic power. Design/methodology/approach - To comply with stricter government regulations demanding a diverse supplier base and match a supplier base to changing customer demographics, a growing number of purchasing organizations have launched supplier diversity programs. Despite such a trend and abundant theory about the supplier diversity program, there is a paucity of case-based research that can explain what it takes to become a supplier diversity champion. To fill the void left by previous studies, the paper conducted an in-depth analysis of Capterpillar's best-practices and unearthed its secret behind the success. Findings - Through Caterpillar's case, it was found that a supplier diversity program could not only help save sourcing cost, but also enhance quality at the source. Thus, it offers long-term competitive advantages. Also, a key to the successful supplier diversity program is the buying firm's ability to adapt to new cultural change that breaks the ties with good old boys networks. Originality/value - The paper elaborated on six different strategic initiatives that provided equal contractual opportunity to historically underutilized but qualified suppliers such as small, small disadvantaged, or women-owned small businesses and leveraged such opportunity to create a strategic sourcing advantage. Other organizations that wish to develop supplier diversity programs may consider these strategic initiatives and emulate Caterpillar's success.","['Supply chain management', 'Suppliers', 'Case studies', 'Corporate strategy', 'Critical success factors', 'nan']",['suppliers'],"['diversity', 'caterpillar']",0.0,0.0

"In contrast to previous studies of pioneer survival that directly compare the survival of market pioneers with later entrants, this paper proposes that a market pioneer, as the first entrant, operates under two distinctly different survival processes, one during the initial monopoly period and another during the later competition period. The two processes of market pioneers need to be separately estimated and compared with the survival process of later entrants. This paper demonstrates a method for decomposing the pioneer's survival and empirically shows how researchers can compare the pioneer survival in two periods with that of later entrants and identify period-specific advantages of pioneering. Our empirical analysis using data collected from two different types of industriesa low-tech (i.e., newspaper) industry and several high-tech industriesreveals several interesting new findings that illustrate the advantages of decomposing pioneer survival. For example, this paper shows that when treating first-mover survival as a single process, one can only find an oversimplified pattern showing that first movers have a survival chance equal to that of second movers in the newspaper industry, but a lower one than the second movers in high-tech industries. However, when analyzing the first-mover's survival as a sequence of monopoly and competition processes, new insights emerge. In the newspaper industry, the pioneers can have survival advantages in both the monopoly and the competition periods relative to the second movers, and there is a significant survival advantage for those second entrants who delay market entry until the first entrant exits. In contrast, the overall pioneer survival disadvantage identified in the high-tech industries when treating the survival as a single process comes from the survival disadvantage in the competition period but not in the monopoly period. Furthermore, our empirical analyses using data from two types of industries reveal completely different patterns with regard to the pioneer survival advantage, which suggests that being first can benefit pioneers in both two-market periods in low-tech industries but can be extremely risky for pioneers to gain any survival advantages in both two-market periods in high-tech industries because the former markets have relatively low market and technology uncertainties, and organizational change is less important; whereas the latter industries have significantly high market and technology uncertainties, technological advances emerge frequently, and firms are required to adapt themselves quickly to a fast-changing environment.","['nan', 'CONSUMER-GOODS INDUSTRIES', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'MARKET PIONEER', 'ADVANTAGES', '1ST', 'PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETITION', 'STRATEGIES', 'SHARE']","['empirical analysis', 'market pioneer', 'advantages', 'competition']","['survival', 'newspaper industry', 'survival', 'newspaper industry']",0.0,0.0
"This research was motivated by an interest in understanding more about the extent to which entrepreneurs initiate changes along various dimensions of strategy, the nature of those changes and their implications for firm performance. Our interest in this topic began with the observation that, within the large body of strategic-change literature, the research effort has focused almost exclusively on large and established firms. Moreover a fundamental assumption underlying much of this work is that strategic change involves movement from one dominant strategic approach to another This premise does little to motivate or contribute to the understanding of change and strategy in new ventures, where it is less likely that a dominant approach exists. Thus, we drew upon the literature in managerial cognition to develop the idea of strategic experimentation as the conceptual foundation for studying change and strategic in new ventures. Our basic premise is that in new ventures, changes along dimensions of strategic are reflective of a process of trial and error learning whereby the entrepreneur seeks to develop an understanding of the competitive situation and determine how to compete within that context. Further, we suggest that some aspects of the firm's strategy are more likely to be the focus of experimentation than others. Building on these premises we developed a series of research hypotheses which propose that the greater the level of perceived environmental hostility, the higher the level of strategic experimentation that will be undertaken. We also propose that experimentation will always be greater along some dimensions of strategy than others, and that the degree of environmental hostility will influence the extent to which there ave performance benefits associated with strategic experimentation. Our hypotheses are tested ruing data from a three-year study of over 400 young businesses. Overall, we find support for our assertions. For entrepreneurs and their advisors, this study has several important implications. First, it suggests that strategic experimentation is a normal part of the process by which entrepreneurs seek to position their businesses. Although the present study does not empirically address the linkage between formal planning and experimentation,the learning and cognition literature upon which the construct of strategic experimentation is based suggests that, no matter how much attention to derail is involved in the preparation of the business plan, the actual formation and development of the business will involve considerable adjustment to and/or deviation from that plan. This is because the process of new business development involves iterative changes in the way the entrepreneur positions his/her firm as he/she develops an understanding about what does and does nor work. The results of this study further suggest that some dimensions of the firm's strategy are,more likely to change than others. Specifically, it appears that peripheral changes (competitive emphasis and time allocation) are more likely to be the focus of such learning and adaptation efforts than core feature (product scope and partnership status). This, in part, is because the former dimensions are easier to change than the latter Moreover, our results show that ventures in,more hostile environments clearly face difficult dilemmas. Although poor performance may stimulate experimentation along various dimensions of strategy, the complexity of learning within a hostile environment suggests that entrepreneurs will have a particularly difficult time determining the type of changes that will make a difference.

"Despite the critical need to know how consumers' perceptions of Web sites influence their behavior, and especially their intention to revisit or purchase, there is no extant general measure for evaluating Web sites and no consensus on what such an instrument should measure.

They refined it through a literature review and interviews with Web designers and users, and tested it using four samples of Web consumers. WebQual includes 12 dimensions (informational fit-to-task, tailored information, trust, response time, ease of understanding, intuitive operations, visual appeal, innovativeness, emotional appeal, consistent image, on-line completeness, relative advantage) and shows strong measurement validity.

"Although ethical scandals are a common phenomenon in the service industry, there is little research on the service-specific aspects of crisis management. In this research, we argue that frontline employees are of crucial importance after a scandal and examine how firms can secure the support of frontline employees following different kinds of scandals. Specifically, we demonstrate that corrective responses that address the internal causes of a scandal and ceremonial responses that guide attention to positive aspects unrelated to the scandal moderate the impact of different scandals on frontline employee support. Three experiments showed that frontline employee support was greater after scandals that involved a great rather than a small number of wrongdoers and after scandals that had been caused by high-ranking managers rather than low-ranking employees when a corrective response was implemented. In contrast, support was greater following scandals that had been committed by a few low-ranking employees rather than high-ranking managers when a ceremonial response was employed. These results have important implications by illustrating how companies can effectively restore frontline employee support following a scandal.","['frontline employees', 'ethical scandals', 'crisis response', 'organizational identification', 'attribution', 'leadership', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY THEORY', 'SERVICE ENCOUNTERS', 'TURNING EMPLOYEES', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'REPAIR', 'BEHAVIOR', 'TRUST', 'ALIGNMENT', 'EXCHANGE', 'SEARCH']","['frontline employees', 'ethical scandals', 'search']","['ethical scandals', 'crisis management']",0.5,0.3333333333333333
"Technology strategy (TS) is one of the most important aspects of any firm's strategic posture especially in dynamic environments such as the computer software industry. Not only do new ventures face the pressures that accompany all young companies (e.g., shortages of capital), but they also have to keep up with a rapid rate of technological change. Consequently TS, the sum of a firm's choices on how to develop and exploit its technological resources, can profoundly affect a venture's performance and survival. This empirical study examines the relationships between TS and new venture performance (NVP). By focusing on TS variables and analyzing their performance outcomes, the study offers insights into the factors that can influence the success of new ventures in a fast-paced environment. This study also examines key environmental moderators, those external environmental forces, which can significantly impact the strength or direction of the relationship between a firm's TS and NVP. The study examines five TSs that can enhance NPV The first is radicality, which means developing and introducing new products ahead of competitors. The second is the intensity of product upgrades, which refers to a venture's commitment to introducing more refinements and extensions of its products than its competition. The third is the level of R&D spending, which indicates a venture's strong investment in internal research and development activities. The fourth is the use of external technology sources (e.g., strategic alliances and licenses) to augment a firm's own R&D efforts. The final dimension is the use of copyrights and other means of protecting the venture's intellectual property. Environmental moderators examined in this paper were: dynamism, price hostility, non-price hostility, and heterogeneity. Dynamism reflects the rate and continuity of change within an industry. Price hostility indicates the intensity of rivalry in an industry based on costs and reduced prices. Non-price hostility indicates an emphasis on product quality and service as the key to success in an industry. Heterogeneity indicates the diversity of the marker segments in the new venture's industry; a heterogeneous environment typically has multiple segments with diverse needs and expectations. To test the impact of environmental moderators on the efficacy of Ts, data were collected from 116 U.S.-based software firms. NVP was measured by return on equity (ROE) and growth of market share (GMS). Overall, the results show that not all of the TS dimensions had a significant effect on NVP, and that the relationships of these dimensions with NVP were moderated by the venture's perceptions of the external environment. Three dimensions of TS were associated with both ROE and GMS: radical new products, frequent product upgrades, and the rise of external technology sources. Further, only frequent product upgrades had a significant impact under all four moderating conditions on both NVP measures. New product radicality enhances both performance variables in dynamic environments; beyond that, it only has a significant negative interaction with price hostility. R&D, however, is generally not associated with strong short-term ROE performance except in heterogeneous environments. Yet, for GMS, R&D is a significant variable except under dynamism. External technology sources also have a strong association with NVP, being insignificant only in the case of GMS in situations of non-price hostility. Finally, the use of copyrights, patents and other means of protecting the company's intellectual capital is generally not associated with NVP under different environmental conditions. In a dynamic environment copyrights (and other means of intellectual property protection) appear to speed lip the diffusion of knowledge to rivals and therefore may not enhance venture performance. The results also suggest that new ventures should pursue a formal technology strategy to achieve successful performance. Those ventures that match their technological choices with their external environments are better positioned to achieve superior performance.

"For early-stage firms, successful commercialization of each new product is critically important, given the shortage of financial resources, the limited product portfolio, and small staffs typical of such firms. This paper investigates two key contributing factors for new product success in entrepreneurial firms: designing products that are appealing to target users in both form and function and designing products that can be manufactured at an attractive margin so that the new enterprise can generate much needed positive cash flow. These two practices-industrial design and cost engineering-are well studied in the context of larger, established corporations but have not been explored in the context of new ventures. This study focuses on the intensity of individual and combined adoption of design and cost engineering as measured by product development efficiency and effectiveness. The study was conducted on a homogeneous sample of early-stage firms that develop physical, assembled products where design plays a role. The data collection focused only on the first product developed by each firm respectively. The results show that when implemented together, industrial design and cost engineering enhance both the effectiveness and efficiency of new product development in early-stage firms, to greater effect than each does individually. Intensive individual adoption of practices had a negative impact on development efficiency measures such as development cost and duration. Only cost engineering individually had a beneficial impact on development effectiveness as measured by product margins. When combined, these two practices had a beneficial impact on both development duration and cost for the company's first commercial product, thereby reducing time-to-market and precious cash expenditures while maximizing project breakeven timing. The most successful firms in the study achieved a balance between creative innovation and cost discipline in the NPD process with third-party design and manufacturing resources. It was found that integrating third-party design firms into the development process can challenge, simplify, and add additional creative resources to the core entrepreneurial team, maximizing the ability to catalyze beneficial tension between creativity and cost discipline.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'INNOVATION', 'DECISIONS', 'STRATEGY', 'PROJECT', 'SUCCESS']","['innovation', 'project', 'success']",[],0,0.0

"Although considerable research exists on consumer processing of nutrition labeling and package claims, less is known about consumer interpretation of nutrient content claims in advertising. This is important because product advertising often provides a significant first step for consumers in learning new nutrition information. Yet, unlike package claims, Nutrition Facts Panels are often not available for consumers during the processing of such advertising claims. Therefore, the authors examine the following research questions: (1) Do consumers misinterpret (i.e., overgeneralize) common nutrient content claims in advertising? If so, under what conditions does this occur? and (2) Can various types of disclosure statements remedy this problem? To address these questions, the authors interview a total of 365 primary food shoppers in three geographically dispersed malls in the United States in a between-subjects experiment. Misleading generalizations, beyond those of control ad claims, are found for general and specific nutrient content claims. Ad disclosure type, ad claim type, and nutrition knowledge all separately influence nutrient content and disease risk measures. Evaluative disclosures reduce misleading generalizations to a greater extent than do absolute or relative disclosures.

"This study investigates and demonstrates the mediating effect of job satisfaction between ream deftness and team comprehension and the performance of 168 project teams involved in major innovation projects for their companies. The study demonstrates that there are at least three independent facets of job satisfaction: instrumental satisfaction with the way the task is progressing, social satisfaction with the way the ream members interact with one another and the organization, and egocentric satisfaction with the individuals' perceived benefits to themselves. Previous studies have shown that innovation team performance is directly correlated with the two antecedents of performance: team deftness, which reflects how effectively the team works to achieve the innovation's purpose and team comprehension, which reflects how the team understands the linkages among key variables driving the innovation outcome. The study argues that these different facets of satisfaction differentially affect the ways in which team performance is affected by deftness and comprehension. There are three major results: 1. Social satisfaction mediates the relation between team deftness and performance-as social dissatisfaction of the team increases, it appears to impede the ability of the team to deploy its deftness in accomplishing the project's purpose. 2. Instrumental satisfaction mediates the relation between team comprehension and project performance-as instrumental dissatisfaction increases, it appears to impede the ability of the team to deploy its comprehension to accomplish the project's purpose. 3. Egocentric satisfaction does not appear to mediate the relation between team deftness and project performance. Some managerial implications of these results are discussed.","['nan', 'JOB-SATISFACTION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-EFFECTIVENESS', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'WORK', 'MODEL', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'PREDICTORS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'ENVIRONMENTS']","['job satisfaction', 'work']",[],0,0.0
"Biased listing is the practice of listing items in electronic marketplaces according to criteria other than the normally expected ones (e.g., relevance or quality). This study investigates the existence, nature, and implications of biased listing effects using the case of an on-line hotel distribution platform. The study is based on real-life booking data provided by Hotel.de, the second-largest hotel-booking platform in Europe, which lists hotels according to the value of their contracts. The contribution of the study is threefold: (1) it reveals the existence of biased listing effects in an e-marketplace for products and services; (2) it explores the nature and functioning of biased listing as a combination of ranking and labeling effects, revealing a crowding-out effect that affects hotels that do not switch to higher-value contracts; (3) it discusses the implications and strategic options for the market parties. The study shows how market providers that engage in biased listing practices are able to exploit their gatekeeper position by making suppliers compete for listing positions on the platform. This research contributes to a better understanding of the role of e-marketplaces as gatekeepers between supply and demand and, at the same time, is part of a wider context of research on consumer decision-making in information-rich decision situations.","['Biased listing', 'cybermediaries', 'e-marketplaces', 'on-line hotel distribution', 'page rank', 'ranking effects', 're-intermediation', 'search', 'SEARCH COSTS', 'E-COMMERCE', 'INFORMATION', 'BUSINESS', 'QUALITY']","['biased listing', 'e marketplaces', 'on line hotel distribution', 'search', 'information', 'quality']","['biased listing', 'marketplaces', 'decision making']",0.3333333333333333,0.16666666666666666
"Service research in the advance selling of experience services is limited in regard to how individual and situational differences influence price information processing. Applying construal-level theory in the context of advance selling of tickets for experience services, this research demonstrates that who (near vs. far social distance), when (near vs. far temporal distance), and where (spatial distance) influence price sensitivity and perceived value of the experience service. Study 1 finds that consumers are more price sensitive when they consider the advance purchase of events taking place further in the future, unless they are experienced, as Study 2 finds. Across both studies, buyers perceive greater value when the time and location of the event are psychologically near. Compared to when social distance is near (self-reference), consumers construe other average buyers in the market to be relatively more price sensitive and to perceive relatively higher value for experience services. Since an important factor at work in the minds of buyers is other buyers, the results imply that service providers should frame offers in reference more to others than the self for experiences. The effects of time and distance suggest managers should carefully geo-target offers customized to when and where customers are when buying tickets. As experienced buyers have learned to be price sensitive for tickets, managers should identify these individuals to provide relevant value-added offers.","['construal-level theory', 'psychological distance', 'price sensitivity', 'perceived value', 'experience service', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE', 'TEMPORAL DISTANCE', 'SPATIAL DISTANCE', 'PERCEIVED VALUE', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'LEVEL THEORY', 'QUALITY', 'MODEL', 'SELF', 'CONSUMPTION']","['construal level theory', 'price sensitivity', 'perceived value', 'experience service', 'temporal distance', 'spatial distance', 'perceived value', 'level theory', 'self']","['construal level', 'distance', 'value', 'self reference']",0.0,0.0

"This article examines how leader firms should respond to the erosion of competitive advantages caused by rapid imitation and innovation in hypercompetitive environments. On the one hand, shorter-lived advantages induce leaders to develop new advantages faster. On the other hand, hypercompetition also erodes the expected returns from new advantages-reducing leaders' incentives to accelerate investments. Since investing faster also raises costs, this article shows that leaders often prefer to renew competitive advantages more slowly in more hypercompetitive industries-thereby increasing the probability of being displaced by competitors. This phenomenon is dubbed self-displacement. Firms' decision to self-displace themselves from industry leadership with greater probability is deliberate and rational-not a result of leaders' inability to respond to competitive threats, as previously assumed in the literature. This article also shows that leaders' rule of thumb in more hypercompetitive environments should be to accelerate the development of advantages with high competitive value but low market value. This study is based on a theoretical model and numerical analysis grounded on stylized empirical facts that govern industry competitive macrodynamics and firm investment microdynamics in most industries. Because the model builds on empirically observable constructs, its theoretical propositions are amenable to large sample testing. Copyright.

"This study examines the value of the time that a user spends to participate in a social game. We focus on how a massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) vendor can establish prices to encourage participation and retain its players. We estimate value through an application of the hedonic pricing model and analyze a data set for an MMORPG in Korea. The results permit us to estimate the value of game-playing time in monetary terms. Based on our empirical results, we propose an economic model and conduct numerical simulation to show how a game vendor can apply differential pricing in this context. This enables us to design a pricing scheme to maximize a game vendor's profit. Our study affirms the long-standing finding that building network effects associated with other game players' participation is a critical source of benefits for the vendor. Going beyond this, we also find it is appropriate to use differential pricing, by subsidizing a participant's game play initially and then charging more aggressively to extract the available consumer surplus over the player's life cycle in the game, in order to reinforce a vendor's ability to maintain a healthy number of game participants.","['Customer valuation', 'econometrics', 'field study', 'hedonic pricing', 'hedonic value', 'MMORPGs', 'online games', 'role-playing games', 'social gaming', 'VIRTUAL WORLDS', 'COMMUNITY LOYALTY', 'HEDONIC PRICES', 'VALUE CREATION', 'GAME USAGE', 'ONLINE', 'DEMAND', 'INDEXES', 'MMORPGS', 'PLAYERS']","['hedonic pricing', 'online', 'players']","['hedonic pricing model', 'game playing time', 'network effects', 'participants']",0.0,0.0
"We test the relationship between shareholder value, stakeholder management, and social issue participation. Building better relations with primary stakeholders like employees, customers, suppliers, and communities could lead to increased shareholder wealth by helping firms develop intangible, valuable assets which can be sources of competitive advantage.

"The author explores how and why the content of an exporter's host market positioning strategy differs from the content of its home market strategy. The research is significant for two reasons: (1) It uses a more comprehensive and rigorous definition and measurement of firm strategy than previous adaptation research, and (2) it systematically measures the magnitude and direction of the adaptation. Previous research has concentrated only on the need to adapt. This approach opens up an entirely new debate about what patterns of adaptation should be expected. The author uses a large-scale survey of Australian exporters to test the emerging hypotheses, which are strongly supported, Domestically based Australian exporters tend to have a narrower focus and rely more heavily on operations-based differentiation in foreign markets.","['nan', 'PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS', 'STANDARDIZATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'COALIGNMENT', 'VENTURES', 'MODEL', 'FIRM']",['firm'],['adaptation'],0.0,0.0
"In this study, we identified and analyzed 75 articles in the family business (FB) literature between 2000 and 2014 as to the case study design they adopted. We found that the positivistic case study approach is the FB disciplinary convention. The two alternative approaches of critical realism and interpretivism are used to a significantly lesser extent.

The other two approaches can be employed to a higher extent since their use is likely to contribute to a scientific pluralism in FB case study research.","['case study', 'family business', 'philosophy of science', 'qualitative positivism', 'critical realism', 'interpretivism', 'QUALITATIVE RESEARCH', 'INTERNATIONALIZATION PATHWAYS', 'RHETORICAL ANALYSIS', 'MANAGEMENT RESEARCH', 'IDENTITY WORK', 'FIRMS', 'SUCCESSION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'GENERATIONS']","['case study', 'family business', 'critical realism', 'interpretivism']","['critical realism', 'interpretivism']",1.0,0.5

"The management of knowledge across country units is critical to multinational corporations (MNCs). Building on the argument that boundary spanning leads to the development of creative problem solving outcomes, this study advances the concept of MNC knowledge transformation and examines its relationship with solution creativity. Using questionnaire data on 67 problem solving projects, we find that opportunity formation is an underlying mechanism linking MNC knowledge transformation to the development of creative solutions. These insights contribute to our understanding of boundary spanning in global organizations by substantiating MNC knowledge transformation and elaborating the relationship between boundary spanning and creative solution development. If successful at knowledge transformation, collaborators from across the MNC can construct previously unimagined opportunities for the generation of creative outcomes.","['boundary spanning', 'knowledge transformation', 'MNE/MNC management', 'opportunity formation', 'problem solving', 'subsidiaries', 'ORGANIZATIONAL DECISION-MAKING', 'PROBLEM-SOLVING PERSPECTIVE', 'MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISE', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITY', 'PROBLEM FORMULATION', 'INNOVATION', 'FIRM', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'SEARCH']","['boundary spanning', 'knowledge transformation', 'opportunity formation', 'problem solving', 'management']",['multinational corporations'],0.0,0.0
"This paper studies the effect of a focal firm, and its partners' local alliance actions, on the creation of technological innovations by the former. More specifically, we study how two types of redundancy in a focal firm's ego network affect its ability to create new technologies in its technology core areas (exploitation) and/or non-core areas (exploration). We analyse this empirically in three different industry settings: chemicals, motor vehicles, and pharmaceuticals. One of our key findings is that individual firms can indeed boost both types of innovative output by shaping the degree of redundancy in their local alliance network, but that the way in which this should be done differs between the creation of core and non-core technologies. Next, we find that it is very useful to unpack the rather abstract notion of redundancy into more specific types of redundancy in ego networks. Overall, these findings reflect an action-oriented view on the role of individual firms in collaborative networks, which may complement the dominant view in the alliance literature emphasizing the role of the overall network structure and firms' network position within it.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'STRUCTURAL HOLES', 'SOCIAL NETWORKS', 'RELATIONAL EMBEDDEDNESS', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'LOCAL SEARCH', 'INNOVATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'EXPLORATION']","['innovation', 'exploration']","['technological innovations', 'exploitation', 'exploration']",0.3333333333333333,0.5
"We study a population of first year midshipmen within an elite military academy to explore the relationship between individuals' sociometric status (e.g., status conferrals based on positive interpersonal affect and perceived competence, and status degradations based on negative interpersonal affect) and their attempts to directly control their peers' behaviour over a year's time. Results show that multiple informal sociometric status hierarchies develop early in the organization's life and remain remarkably stable. Control attempts are driven by these status hierarchies: Lower competence status individuals and those who attract negative status degradations are targeted for control by more people early in the group's life, those relatively free of negative status degradations attempt to control greater numbers of others throughout the group's existence, while higher positive status is generally unrelated to control attempts. However, control attempts do not lead to higher future sociometric status, suggesting they are not status signals.

"Analyzing data from a sample of 420 global leaders (matched with 221 supervisors), we found a combined effect of personality characteristics (extraversion, openness to experience, and lower neuroticism) and cross-cultural experiences (organization-initiated cross-cultural work experiences and non-work cross-cultural experiences) as predictors of dynamic cross-cultural competencies (tolerance of ambiguity, cultural flexibility, and reduced ethnocentrism). These competencies, in turn, are predictors of supervisors' ratings of global leadership effectiveness.

"Achieving an effective business design across the Internet and the off-line channel is a critical concern for a hybrid firm's choice of pricing strategy. Two pricing models are proposed to examine how consumer channel migration (one-way channel interaction from the traditional sales channel to the Internet) affects pricing strategy. One model has no interaction between the Internet and off-line channels. The other includes the possibility of one-way migration to the Internet channel and incorporates consumers' channel-switching costs and loyalty to the firm. The two models offer interesting results for understanding traditional and Internet-based selling. A high level of channel migration leads a firm to manage the two channels as one. With low channel migration, in contrast, the firm should optimize and manage each channel separately. The models had two main findings: (1) the level of channel migration determines a hybrid firm's pricing strategy; (2) a hybrid firm's price-level choice should be determined by the on-line demand proportion of its business. The modeling results were validated with empirical analysis for 10 large South Korean e-commerce firms by comparing prices in different product categories for various types of hybrid firms and Internet-only firms. This research offers new marketing strategy insights for managers of hybrid firms who wish to optimize price-setting decisions based on interactions between distribution channels and the intensity of the firm's involvement in the on-line channel.","['Business policy', 'channel migration', 'channel-switching costs', 'e-commerce', 'empirical research', 'hybrid firm', 'loyalty', 'marketing', 'on-line channel', 'pricing models', 'pricing strategy', 'CUSTOMER LOYALTY', 'SWITCHING COSTS', 'INTERNET', 'DETERMINANTS', 'MARKETS', 'MODEL', 'OPPORTUNITIES', 'SATISFACTION', 'INFORMATION', 'INTEGRATION']","['channel migration', 'channel switching costs', 'e commerce', 'hybrid firm', 'loyalty', 'marketing', 'on line channel', 'pricing models', 'pricing strategy', 'switching costs', 'internet', 'model']","['internet', 'consumer channel migration', 'off line channels']",0.3333333333333333,0.08333333333333333
"While political CSR scholarship has focused on the role of dialogue between MNCs and civil society actors at the transnational level in creating global governance standards, we seek to understand how political CSR might play out at the 'coalface' where labour rights violations occur. We draw on insights from Industrial Democracy to examine how political CSR may be extended to enable democratic processes at the workplace level. Studying the introduction of workplace dialogue in Bangladesh apparel factories, we highlight how MNCs leverage their position as lead actors in the supply chain in three ways: as guarantors, capacity-builders and enforcers of workplace dialogue. Our findings also show that dialogue reveals dialectical tensions emerging from the structured antagonism of the supply chain relationship. Our contribution focuses on understanding how MNCs may enable deliberative spaces in their supply chain, but also how this is likely to change the nature of pCSR.","['global labour governance', 'industrial democracy', 'industrial relations', 'labour rights', 'supply chains', 'worker voice', 'EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS', 'SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'LABOR STANDARDS', 'SUPPLY CHAINS', 'GOVERNANCE', 'RIGHTS', 'ACCOUNTABILITY', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'BUSINESS', 'TRADE']","['industrial democracy', 'labour rights', 'governance', 'rights']","['political csr', 'industrial democracy', 'workplace', 'bangladesh', 'pcsr']",0.2,0.25
"Although universally recognized as an important consideration in building product development (PD) competency, the effect of a firm's ability to vary its PD practices to develop winning products has been given scant attention in large-scale, multiorganizational, quantitative studies. This research explores differences in formal new PD practices among three project typesincremental, more innovative, and radical. Using a sample of 380 business units, this research investigates how development practices differ across these three classes of innovation with respect to the formal PD process, project organization, PD strategy, organizational culture, and senior management commitment. Our results diverge from several commonly held beliefs about formal PD processes and the management of radical versus incremental innovations. Our results indicate that radical projects are managed less flexibly than incremental projects. Instead of being an offshoot of less strategic planning, radical projects are just as strategically aligned as incremental projects. Instead of being informally introduced entrepreneurial adventures, radical projects are often the result of more formal ideation methods. While these results may be counterintuitive to suppositional models of how to radical innovation happens, it is the central theme of this research to show how radical innovation actually happens. Our findings also provide a foundation for reexamining the role of control in the management of innovation. As the level of innovativeness increased, so too did the amount of controls imposede.g., less flexibility in the development process, more professional, full-time project leadership, centralized executive oversight for new products, and formal financial assessments of expected NP performance.","['nan', 'TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION', 'DISCONTINUOUS INNOVATION', 'SUCCESS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'BENCHMARKING', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EXECUTION', 'CHAMPIONS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'TRENDS']",['performance'],['product development'],0.0,0.0
"Building on psychology research about culture's influences on emotional expressions and experiences. I considered culture's consequences for acquirers' emotional attending during post-merger integration. Analyses of cross-border acquisitions by multinational companies from the United States showed support for a subtle role of culture - on the one hand, cultural differences constrain emotional attending during post-merger integration; on the other hand, when acquisitions are made in cultures that are characterized by more humane orientation, U.S. acquirers seem to adapt to this local context and showed more emotional attending than in less humane-oriented cultures. The findings further suggest that these effects depend on an acquirer's multiculturalism. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

"The emergence of socially responsible investing has led to the development of a large number of methodologies for rating corporate social responsibility and to a growing body of research exploring the link between environmental and financial performance. Increased availability of information potentially generates an abundance of riches upon which to base investment decisions, but it also raises issues of commensurability, information overload, and confusion. Using a unique data set combining environmental ratings from three leading purveyors, we identify the principal components of corporate environmental performance. We find that two distinct factors the environmental processes and practices implemented by firms, and the environmental outcomes they generate explain 80% of the variance of the data.

"The field of lead user research has seen a great deal of attention from academics and practitioners alike. However, we still lack a full understanding of the nature of users with high potential for innovation. In this paper, we employ a social network perspective on lead users. Increasing the realism of our research in three empirical studies with different empirical settings and methods, we provide robust evidence that lead users have a distinctive social network position: They exhibit an unusually high level of betweenness centrality, meaning that they are positioned as bridges between different social groups. This finding has two major implications for lead user theory. First, it consolidates seminal conceptual work on lead users and their embeddedness in social networks. And second, the findings extend and validate prior work on the social network perspective of lead users by combining theoretical insights from cognitive psychology, research on creativity, and network theory. As the social network positions of individuals can be mapped quickly and at low cost with modern Web mining tools, our findings may point to a new and readily applicable approach for the efficient and effective identification of lead users in real-life projects, an aspect that is usually emphasized as the most crucial activity in lead user projects.","['nan', 'INNOVATIONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CREATIVITY', 'NETNOGRAPHY', 'DIFFUSION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'FUTURE', 'FIELD']","['creativity', 'field']","['innovation', 'lead user theory', 'social networks', 'creativity', 'network theory', 'projects']",0.16666666666666666,0.5
"Mass customization has received considerable interest among researchers. However, although many authors have analyzed this concept from different angles, the question of which factors can be used to spot customers most likely to adopt a mass-customized product has not been answered to a satisfactory extent until now. This article explicitly deals with this question by focusing on factors related to the base category, which is defined as the group of all standardized products within the same product category as the mass-customized product under investigation. Specifically, this article investigates the influence of a customer's base category consumption frequency and need satisfaction on the decision to adopt a mass-customized product within this base category. A set of competing hypotheses regarding these influences is developed and subsequently evaluated by a combination of partial least squares and latent class analysis. This is done by using a sample of 2,114 customers surveyed regarding their adoption of an individualized printed newspaper. The results generated are threefold: First, it is shown that there is a significant direct influence of base category consumption frequency and need satisfaction on the behavioral intention to adopt. The more frequently a subject consumes products out of the base category or the more satisfied his or her needs are due to this consumption, the higher the behavioral intention to adopt a mass-customized product within this base category. Second, the article provides an indication that base category consumption frequency has a significant moderating effect when investigating the behavioral intention to adopt in the context of the theory of reasoned action and the technology acceptance model. The more frequently a subject consumes products out of the base category, the more important will be the impact of perceived ease of use mediated by perceived usefulness. Finally, this article shows that different latent classes with respect to unobserved heterogeneity regarding the latent variables base category need satisfaction or dissatisfaction have significantly different adoption behaviors. Individuals who show a high level of need dissatisfaction are less interested in the ease of use of a mass-customized product than its usefulness (i.e., increase in need satisfaction). On the other hand, subjects who have a high degree of base category need satisfaction base their adoption decision mainly on the ease of use of the mass-customized product. These results are of managerial relevance regarding the prediction of market reactions and the understanding of the strategic use of product-line extensions based on mass-customized products. This work provides an indication that base category consumption frequency and need satisfaction positively influence the behavioral intention to adopt a mass-customized product. Hence, mass customization can be seen as one way to deepen the relationship with existing clients.","['nan', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY', 'USER ACCEPTANCE', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'TOOLKITS', 'TRUST', 'HETEROGENEITY', 'COMMITMENT', 'INNOVATION', 'DESIGN']",['heterogeneity'],"['mass customization', 'consumption frequency', 'need satisfaction', 'least squares', 'latent class analysis']",0.0,0.0
"Taking a temporal view of learning in partnerships, we argue that learning to contract from prior relationships can be manifested not only in an increase in the level of contractual detail but also in a decrease in negotiation time for a given level of contractual detail. We analyse the influence that the length of prior relationships and the detail of termination provisions have on negotiation time, or the time period that it takes for partners to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. We find that: (1) the length of prior relationships has a curvilinear, U-shaped effect on negotiation time, suggesting the possibility of diverse learning mechanisms as the relationship unfolds; (2) the impact of the detail of termination provisions on negotiation time varies across different types of termination provisions; and (3) it takes a shorter time to negotiate certain types of termination provisions when partners have longer prior relationships. Beyond suggesting the need to investigate the consequences of contractual provisions for collaborators, our study proposes negotiation time as an additional indicator of a learning-to-contract effect that complements existing ones.","['contracts', 'prior relationships', 'partnerships', 'termination provisions', 'learning', 'negotiation time', 'TRANSACTION COST', 'FORMAL CONTRACTS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'GOVERNANCE', 'COOPERATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TRUST']","['prior relationships', 'partnerships', 'termination provisions', 'learning', 'negotiation time']","['learning', 'contract']",0.5,0.2
"Consumer footprints left on the Internet help advertisers show consumers relevant Web ads, which increase awareness and click-throughs. This proof of concept experiment illustrates how Internet behavior can identify relevant television commercials that increase ad-effectiveness by raising attention and ad exposure. Product involvement and prior brand exposure, however, complicate effective Internet-targeting. Ad relevance matters more for low-involvement products, which have a short pre-purchase search process. For the same reason, using Web browsing behavior to make inferences about current ad relevance is more accurate for low-involvement products. Prior brand exposure reduces information-value, even for relevant commercials, and therefore dampens ad relevance's effect on attention and ad exposure.

Scholars agree that the outcome of such entrepreneurial exits needs to be assessed based on the individual entrepreneur's perception and on multiple dimensions. Yet, to date we lack theory and measures that capture this outcome, which we define as entrepreneurs' perceived exit performance (PEP).

"Traditional technology adoption research has assumed a single adopting group. However, there are many settings in which multiple groups must jointly adopt an innovation in order for it to succeed. This is particularly true for new information technology innovations that mediate the relationship between two groups. For example, online exchanges (e.g., Freemarkets, GoFish) must attract both suppliers and buyers in order to be successful. The same is true for providers of hardware/software solutions for electronic data interchange and supply chain management. This article describes the phenomenon of multigroup adoption with a particular focus on applications within the financial services and retailing industries. Empirically, the article reports findings from a study that illustrates the importance of evaluating and managing multigroup technology adoption in the specific context of an in-market trial of a new smart card-based electronic payment system. Two distinct groups critical to the smart card's success are studied: consumers (who must decide to use the new card) and retailers (who must agree to adopt and use new technology needed to process smart card transactions). The study identifies which characteristics of the smart card innovation are most closely linked to intention to adopt for each group, and examines how these key characteristics differ by group. Perceptual data were collected via a mail survey from consumers and merchants living in the city where a one-year market trial of the new card was taking place. Four separate sampling frames were established for both consumers and merchants who were participating in the trial as well as both consumers and merchants who were not participating in the trial. Random samples were then drawn from these frames. More than 350 consumers and over 250 merchants completed and returned the survey. Responses were analyzed separately for each of the four groups sampled. The most important characteristic leading to adoption identified by all four groups was relative advantage - the smart card had to demonstrate a clear competitive advantage over what they currently used. Compatibility (i.e., the degree to which the smart card fit with their current preferences) was also noted as important to all but the nonparticipating merchant group. Beyond this, the key drivers of adoption differed considerably by group. Participating consumers and participating merchants appeared to possess different perspectives when assessing their decision to adopt the smart card technology, Consumers seemed to value the notion that the adoption decision is under their control, whereas merchants seemed to place more value on the antecedents that had the potential to add to their bottom line. This suggests that it is necessary to institute different marketing tactics to attract the early adopting groups. In addition, significant differences in the importance of antecedents between participating and nonparticipating consumers and participating and nonparticipating merchants suggest that, over time, it may also be necessary to develop and use different marketing tactics for later adopters.

"Established literature on new product development (NPD) management recognizes top management involvement (TMI) as one of the most critical success factors. With increasing pressure to sustain competitive advantage and growth, NPD activities remain the focus of close interest from top management in many organizations. TMI in the NPD domain is receiving increasing academic attention. Despite its criticality, there is no systematic review of the existing literature to inform and stimulate researchers in the field for further investigation. This paper introduces the current state of literature on TMI in NPD, synthesizes important findings, and identifies the gaps and deficiencies in this research stream. The contents of the selected articles, which investigated TMI in NPD, are analyzed based on the type of the study, level of analysis, research methodology, operationalization of TMI, and main findings. Additionally, other studies, which did not directly investigate TMI and support in NPD, but were sufficiently related, are briefly summarized. As a result of this detailed literature review, it can be stated that both exploratory and relational studies provide rich evidence on the critical role of top management in NPD. However, the identified gaps and deficiencies in this research stream call for a better theoretical understanding and well-defined constructs of TMI in the NPD domain for different levels of analysis for future studies.","['nan', 'DEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'SUCCESS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'NPD', 'DETERMINANTS', 'INTEGRATION', 'COMMITMENT', 'INDUSTRIAL']","['success', 'npd']",['product'],0.0,0.0
"Customer retention has become a focal priority. However, the process of implementing an effective retention campaign is complex and dependent on firms' ability to accurately identify both at-risk customers and those worth retaining. Drawing on empirical and simulated data from two online retailers, we evaluate the performance of several parametric and nonparametric churn prediction techniques, in order to identify the optimal modeling approach, dependent on context. Results show that under most circumstances (i.e., varying sample sizes, purchase frequencies, and churn ratios), the boosting technique, a nonparametric method, delivers superior predictability. Furthermore, in cases/contexts where churn is more rare, logistic regression prevails. Finally, where the size of the customer base is very small, parametric probability models outperform other techniques.","['customer churn', 'prediction', 'profitability', 'retention', 'probability models', 'data mining', 'simulations', 'CUSTOMER-BASE ANALYSIS', 'SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE', 'SWITCHING BEHAVIOR', 'LIFETIME VALUE', 'MODELS', 'SATISFACTION', 'ATTRITION', 'CLASSIFIERS', 'DEFECTION', 'FRAMEWORK']","['prediction', 'retention', 'probability models', 'models']","['customer retention', 'churn prediction techniques']",0.0,0.0
"The current research offers a new theoretical perspective on the relationship between power and persuasion. An agentic-communal model of power is presented that proposes power affects both the messages generated by communicators and the messages that persuade audiences. Compared to low-power states, highpower states produce a greater emphasis on information that conveys competence. As a consequence, high-power communicators generate messages with greater competence information, and high-power audiences are persuaded more by competence information. In contrast to high-power states, low-power states produce a greater emphasis on information that conveys warmth. As a result, lowpower communicators generate messages with greater warmth information, and low-power audiences are persuaded more by warmth information. Because of these two outcomes, a power-matching effect occurs between communicator and audience power: high-power communicators are more effective in persuading high-power audience members, whereas low-power communicators are more effective in persuading low-power audience members. Four experiments find support for these effects in oral and written contexts with three distinct manipulations of power. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that the persuasiveness of messages can be affected by the alignment between the psychological sense of power of the communicator and the audience.","['power', 'persuasion', 'agentic-communal', 'warmth', 'competence', 'SOCIAL-CLASS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'ATTITUDE', 'SELF', 'ORIENTATION', 'COMPLEMENTARITY', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'INHIBITION', 'DIMENSIONS', 'EXPERIENCE']","['power', 'persuasion', 'agentic communal', 'warmth', 'competence']","['persuasion', 'warmth']",1.0,0.4
"We distinguish between family companies, involving multiple family members as owners and/or managers, and lone-founder companies, involving only the founder and no other family members. We apply social identity theory and organizational identification to elucidate the differences between these two types of firms, and how their differing organizational identities reflect unique desires for control and influence. We then consider how these differences are reflected in a firm's board structure (i.e., directorship interlocks, director experiences, and director tenures). Specifically, we predict that family firms are more likely to interlock with other family firms, select directors with more experience in family firms, and keep directors on their boards longer. Correspondingly, we posit that family firms are less likely to interlock with lone-founder firms or to select directors with experience in lone-founder-controlled firms. Lone-founder firms follow a similar pattern. We also consider the consequences of family and lone-founder ownership and board structures on the investment behavior of three classes of institutional investors.

This study builds on the ongoing research being undertaken by the authors, entitled Designing for reverse logistics (DfRL) within the building life cycle: practices, drivers and barriers, which is examining the best practices and drivers that could be used as a road map for developing appropriate solutions for the successful implementation of RL. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected by utilising a triangulated data collection approach, a literature review and 49 questionnaires. The review of the literature identified 16 barriers to implementing RL. The quantitative survey data were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics with correlation analysis to examine the relationships between different pairs of variables comprising RL's critical barriers. Findings - The following barriers were indicated as most significant: lack of incorporation of salvaged materials by designers; regulation restrictions to usage of recovered materials and components; potential legal liabilities; higher costs; and longer-time association with deconstructing buildings. The least ranked barriers were mostly drawn from the operational and industrial categories as being: organisational lack of support for deconstruction due to incompatible design; lack of organisational support for deconstructing buildings due to higher health and safety risks; and inadequate skills and experience for deconstruction (operational). The industrial barrier was related to higher costs of salvaged materials in comparison to virgin products. Research limitations/implications - First, the reported findings are focussed on one study that used questionnaire surveys within the construction industry; therefore, the results may not be generalisable to other contexts. Further, studies should be conducted and extended to other industrial sectors beyond the construction industry. Second, the quantitative study (n = 49) used a smaller sample, and the survey items were based on the review of the literature. Practical implications - The identified barriers could be used as a road map for the development of appropriate solutions for the successful implementation of RL, and to improve the environment- related decision-making processes of contractors. Originality/value - This study makes a contribution to the body of knowledge on the subject of RL within a previously unexplored SA context. In addition, the study provides some insights on the contributory effects of the barriers to the implementation of RL. It is the first work undertaken to determine the barriers to the adoption of RL within the SA construction industry.","['Construction industry', 'Barriers', 'Reverse logistics', 'South Australia', 'Correlation analysis & Descriptive statistics', 'Supply chain management', 'SCM', 'SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT', 'CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS', 'CONTRACTORS', 'INDUSTRY', 'SUSTAINABILITY', 'IMPACT', 'WASTE', 'PERSPECTIVES', 'CAPABILITIES', 'METHODOLOGY']","['construction industry', 'barriers', 'reverse logistics', 'south australia', 'contractors', 'industry', 'methodology']",['reverse logistics'],1.0,0.14285714285714285
"Knowledge transfer within multinational enterprises is a source of competitive advantage. However, we know little about repatriates' role in reverse knowledge transfer upon their return to headquarters (HQ). Using an organizational embeddedness perspective, we conceptualized how embeddedness fit - individuals' perceived match between their knowledge and skills and the job requirements - during the expatriation assignment and upon repatriation predicts repatriate knowledge transfer. To test the hypotheses, we collected multi-wave survey data from 129 repatriates and their supervisors and developed a repatriate knowledge transfer scale. The results show that perceived organizational support from HQ positively influences embeddedness fit, both in the host unit during expatriation and in the HQ upon repatriation. Further, embeddedness fit in the HQ upon repatriation has a direct effect, while embeddedness fit in the host unit during expatriation has an indirect effect on repatriate knowledge transfer via increased communication frequency with the former host unit. In addition, we found that knowledge transfer is particularly pronounced for repatriates with both high levels of embeddedness fit in the HQ upon repatriation and frequent communication with colleagues in their former host unit. Our results highlight the critical importance of helping expatriates increase their perceived embeddedness fit for reverse knowledge transfer to occur.","['expatriation', 'repatriation', 'knowledge transfer', 'organizational embeddedness fit', 'PERCEIVED ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT', 'SUBSIDIARY ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'JOB EMBEDDEDNESS', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'SOCIALIZATION TACTICS', 'EXPATRIATE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STAY', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'ADJUSTMENT']","['expatriation', 'repatriation', 'knowledge transfer', 'perceived organizational support', 'expatriate']","['knowledge', 'embeddedness', 'perceived organizational support']",0.3333333333333333,0.2
"The authors briefly review the literature on occupational health, including occupational medicine, occupational health psychology, and occupational safety, framing the current convergence of these from their scientific origins in preventive medicine and its most basic science of epidemiology, in psychology, and in engineering. They give attention to the burden of suffering, which concerns issues of morbidity and mortality within a population group, and consider both the economic and humanitarian perspectives of the burden of suffering, which may occur within a working population as a result of poor occupational health. The authors see reason for optimism for the future and identify two sets of emerging trends: one set that includes four positive advances positive health, leadership, mood and emotions, and interventions-and one that falls under the authors' rubric of new horizons-technology, virtual work, globalization, and aging.

"In this paper we provide a counterpoint to conventional views on integrative reviews in knowledge development, as exemplified by Elsbach and Van Knippenberg (2020). First, we critique their proposed integrative review by identifying and problematizing several key assumptions underlying it, particularly their idea that the integrative review can simply build on existing studies and lead the way to knowledge. Second, based on this critique, we propose as an alternative the problematizing review, which is based on the following four core principles: the ideal of reflexivity, reading more broadly but selectively, not accumulating but problematizing, and the concept that 'less is more'. In contrast to the integrative review, which regards reviews as a 'building exercise', the problematizing review regards reviews as an 'opening up exercise' that enables researchers to imagine how to rethink existing literature in ways that generate new and 'better' ways of thinking about specific phenomena.","['knowledge development', 'literature review', 'problematization', 'reflexivity', 'LEADERSHIP', 'OPPORTUNITIES', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'MANAGEMENT']","['knowledge development', 'reflexivity']",['integrative reviews'],0.0,0.0
"Research summary We examine the correlations between financial resource allocation flow between business segments and two measures of overall firm financial performance using a sample of Compustat firms. Our analysis finds a consistent inverted U-shape (or alternatively, V-shape) relationship between those measures and firm profitability. Interestingly, nearly all the data lie on the upward sloping part of the curve. Taken together, these results support the notion that flows of financial capital are most often positively correlated with financial performance. Managerial summary A key question for any organization is how reallocating capital across business units is related to overall firm performance. We examine the correlations of firm profitability with a measure of change in year-to-year allocations across business units in a data set of several thousand firms spanning 18 years. Except in cases of the most extreme reallocations, our measure of firm reallocation is positively correlated with firm performance. Because we cannot prove causality, we cautiously conclude that our findings are consistent with a story that, in most cases, firms would benefit from greater internal reallocation of capital. The managerial question then becomes what dynamic capabilities are necessary to increase the flow of resources across business segments? Policies aimed at increasing allocation flow are likely to be beneficial.","['corporate finance', 'dynamic capabilities', 'internal capital markets', 'inertia', 'resource allocation', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'DARK SIDE', 'ENTERPRISE', 'FIRM', 'INVESTMENT', 'INCENTIVES', 'ESCALATION', 'STRATEGY']","['dynamic capabilities', 'resource allocation', 'dynamic capabilities', 'firm']","['resource allocation', 'financial performance', 'profitability', 'capital', 'dynamic capabilities']",0.4,0.5

"This paper explores the basic question of whether manufacturing-based relatedness between business units within a multibusiness Jinn serves as a basis for a competitive advantage at the business unit level. We developed a system for describing manufacturing relatedness that combines the study of value chain activities with 4-digit SIC codes, then we assessed presence of manufacturing synergies. We found no evidence that, on average, organizations involved in manufacturing-related businesses are reaping financial benefits from shared resources in manufacturing.

"In entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial exploration and exploitation have been considered central activities for the survival, growth, and renewal of businesses. In this review we systematically examine research on these topics in family business.

"Purpose - This paper aims to, by connecting to the ongoing conversation on the importance of supply chain visibility, empirically examine the impact of visibility in supply chain relationships, on resource sharing among and on the performance of humanitarian organizations. Design/methodology/approach - Survey data were collected from 101 humanitarian organizations in Southeast Asia. The organizations all experienced being interconnected within the supply chain relationships formed in humanitarian response settings. Data are used to test the conceptually developed model, using the structural equation modeling-partial least square (SEM-PLS) approach. Findings - Results show that visibility has a significant impact on resource sharing and the performance of the organizations, especially in terms of the willingness to share resources, resources used and flexibility of organizations. The results also show that, in situations of high uncertainty, the association between resource sharing and performance becomes weaker. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to the method used. Practical implications - Findings of this research provide insights for humanitarian practitioners on the need to increase visibility of the scarce resources available within the relationships formed during a disaster relief operation to improve overall disaster response. The level of uncertainty in terms of needs assessment, number of affected people, location of a disaster and so forth, is also taken into account in the recommendations made.

"There has been a good deal of debate regarding the performance of family firms. Explanations for divergent findings have ranged from variations in governance arrangements to particular organizational practices. One avenue that has not been much explored is the role played by industry. We theorize that market requirements, when coupled with firm-specific behaviors and resources, can account for why some family businesses do well in particular industries. More precisely, due to their long-term orientation and the intimate connection among family members, some family firms are especially adept at accumulating human capital, passing on tacit knowledge, protecting and leveraging reputation, and building strong relationships and slack resources. These capacities promote success in industries with high levels of uncertainty regarding product quality, product value, and demand. The arts-related industries, we shall argue, are one such environment, and we use it to demonstrate our thesis that family firms, if oriented appropriately, can thrive where relationships, tacit knowledge, and reputation are demanded.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE CREATION', 'SOCIOEMOTIONAL WEALTH', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'SLACK RESOURCES', 'VIEW', 'AGENCY', 'STEWARDSHIP', 'OWNERSHIP', 'MICROFOUNDATIONS', 'FAMILINESS']",['slack resources'],"['knowledge', 'reputation']",0.0,0.0
"This paper examines the linkage effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) on firm-level productivity in Chinese manufacturing. It is found that FDI generates positive vertical linkage effects in Chinese manufacturing at both the national and regional levels, and limited positive horizontal spillovers at the regional level. While OECD firms gain from both vertical and (probably) horizontal linkages, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwanese firms benefit only from backward linkage effects. In the domestic sector, in which we are most interested, both state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs are hurt by competition from foreign firms in the same industries. While SOEs gain from vertical linkages with foreign firms, non-SOEs are unable to do so. The patterns of productivity spillovers from FDI in Chinese manufacturing seem to be determined by one key factor-the technological capabilities of the firms involved. Important data limitations and policy implications of this research are discussed.

"Past research studies on service failures and recovery have conceptualized voice in terms of customers having an opportunity to air complaints after failures occur In contrast, the authors introduce the concept of recovery voice, which entails a service provider asking a customer (after a failure has occurred) what the firm can do to rectify the problem. In a scenario-based experiment carried out in an airline setting and in a hotel setting with 216 and 208 participants, respectively, it was found that customers perceived greater procedural justice when offered recovery voice, which resulted in higher overall postfailure satisfaction. It was shown that perceived procedural justice mediated the effect of recovery voice on overall satisfaction. Furthermore, recovery voice had a greater impact on perceived procedural justice for established customers with long transaction histories than for new ones with short transaction histories.

"This article examines how mainstream consumer thinking is structured in order to form opinions about consumer rights, government regulation, and individual responsibility in the credit card setting. A broader political ideology-one that intertwines consumption practices with a causal narrative of business, society, and state-infuses consumer opinions. The article finds that four sociohistorically shaped political myths compete in this ideological space: individual autonomy, social equality, consumer sovereignty, and corporate dominance. Consumers negotiate tensions between each of these four myths-for example, individual autonomy versus social equality, and consumer sovereignty versus corporate dominance. This ideology triggers moral judgments among consumers about self and others that inform their perceptions of deservedness and apportions degrees of responsibility and blame across consumer, business, and government participants.","['nan', 'IDEOLOGY', 'MARKET']",['ideology'],['ideology'],1.0,1.0
"Many brands build market share by acting as a substitute when competitive brands become undesirable or difficult to obtain. Notably, prior research offers competing strategic recommendations for marketers hoping to encourage consumers to engage in substitution. Past research examining substitute selection-measuring consumers' beliefs about how well one product will substitute for another-suggests that marketers should offer replacements that are similar to the initially preferred product. In contrast, research examining substitute effectiveness-the consequences of substitution-suggests that differentiated brands will enjoy more long-term success. We integrate these two streams of research, explaining why there is a mismatch between substitute selection and substitute effectiveness, replicating and showing boundary conditions for the effects, and testing a managerial intervention that encourages consumers to choose more dissimilar (and more effective) substitutes.","['Substitution', 'Choice', 'Brand similarity', 'BRAND', 'SIMILARITY', 'CHOICE', 'PREFERENCE', 'PRODUCTS', 'JUDGMENT', 'FEATURES', 'IMPACT', 'MARKET', 'FOOD']","['substitution', 'brand', 'market']",[],0,0.0
"Agent technology has been applied to design new services known as shopbots that simplify product and merchant brokering in severer consumer industries. The use of shopbots is expected to reduce consumer search costs and make buying behavior more rational. Based upon a decision-making model, the author proposed 12 hypotheses pertaining to the effects of shopbot use on consumer buying behavior and tested them in an experiment in which consumers chose a financial-service provider. His hypotheses relating to changes in information-search behavior were strongly supported, but there was only partial support for the hypotheses on changes in choice behavior, and no evidence of differences at the problem-recognition and judgment stages of the buying process between consumers using shopbots and other consumers. Although this research was exploratory the findings suggest that vendors of high-complexity products need not fear losing customers because of shopbot use. Since many customers perceive shopbots as value-added services that make information search on the Internet more satisfying, offering access to such services may help vendors to retain their customers.","['consumer buying behavior', 'Internet marketing', 'product brokering', 'shopbots', 'software agents', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'SEARCH COSTS', 'INFORMATION', 'ONLINE']","['consumer buying behavior', 'shopbots', 'decision making', 'search costs', 'information']",['choice'],0.0,0.0

Drawing on a comparative, longitudinal case study of the market categories functional foods' and nanotechnology' in Finland, we find that evolving perceptions, knowledge, and goals also impact categorization. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers that goal-based categorization is characteristic for vital market categories, and the lack thereof may mark a waning interest and category decline.

"Research summary: Two central issues in strategic management are the determination of a firm's internal delegation and its vertical boundaries. Despite the importance of these issues, there is scant analysis concerning their interaction. Using a comprehensive database of the construction industry, we show that vertical integration positively influences the centralization decision and that the main mechanism driving this relationship is an improvement in the hierarchically coordinated adaptation of firm activities when complexity and uncertainty are high. We also observe that centralization is negatively related to the extent of relational contracts between principals and agents, and positively related to an exogenous increase in the cost of employee layoffs. Our results suggest that managers cannot consider firm boundaries and internal organization to be independent decisions. Managerial summary: We ask whether a firm's decision about vertically integrating or outsourcing its activities affects the choice of centralizing or delegating its internal decision-making process. Our statistical analysis shows that firms with more vertical integration tend to centralize the decision-making process and that firms that outsource more tend to decentralize more. Why? Vertical integration enables the use of centralized authority to coordinate activities that interact intensively. Accordingly, we found that the positive influence of vertical integration on centralization is especially significant in more complex and uncertain environments, when the need for coordination is higher. Thus, our results suggest that managers should choose vertical integration considering its effect on internal decision-making processes, particularly when coordination is important.

"We develop and test a cross-level theoretical framework assuming that countries differ in national corporate governance institutions (NCGIs) protecting firm shareholders and employees, and that such NCGI protections moderate the firm-level relationship between organizational slack and innovation effort, that is, the purposeful allocation of firm resources toward the development of new products and services (as distinct from the new products and services themselves). We find support for framework predictions in two-stage estimated dependent variable analyses of organizational slack and institutional protections of shareholders and employees at more than 7000 firms from 29 countries observed from 1991 to 2005. Stronger shareholder protections diminish while stronger employee protections magnify slack effects on innovation effort.

"Purpose Despite several contributions to greenhouse gas emission and carbon footprint reduction, the literature lacks empirical insights into the business impact of climate risks, when they materialize, and techniques to manage them. This study aims to devise a model delving into critical climate risks and the role of consortia and social capital to mitigate these risks. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods approach was used, including qualitative and quantitative data from small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in an Australian agrifood supply chain (AFSC). Findings The qualitative analysis uncovers four critical climate risks and a repertoire of relational, structural, and cognitive social capital accrued by SMEs of AFSC through consortia. The quantitative analysis corroborates that the SMEs that accumulate higher social capital through active engagement within consortia are able to respond more effectively to climate risks than to others. The authors, therefore, find that climate risk mitigation in SMEs is the function of both association (consortia) membership and the accrual of higher social capital through active involvement and collaboration within networks. Originality/value This is the first study in using a moderated-moderation model that simultaneously investigates the business impact of climate risks and how the moderating impact of consortia (a primary moderator) is further moderated by social capital (a secondary moderator) in explaining SMEs performance.

"Specifications of many product attributes (prices, review scores, fuel efficiency, calories, computer processor speed, etc.) are numerical. When comparing alternatives, consumers often need to judge how much larger or smaller one value is than another (say x and y). How do they make such a judgment? The literature suggests that people can rely on either the absolute difference (x - y) or relative difference (x / y). Importantly, relying on the absolute versus relative difference might lead to divergent outcomes. Therefore, this research aims to identify one factor that moderates consumers' reliance on absolute versus relative differences. Specifically, we propose that when the attribute is easy to evaluate (i.e., when consumers have clear reference information), people tend to compute and rely on absolute differences to make comparative judgments. By contrast, when the attribute evaluability is low (i.e., reference information is lacking), they tend to compute the relative difference. Results from six studies provide convergent evidence for this proposition and demonstrate its downstream effects on preference and judgments.","['numerical comparison', 'absolute versus relative differences', 'evaluability', 'PREFERENCE REVERSALS', 'SEPARATE EVALUATIONS', 'EXPLANATION', 'NUMEROSITY', 'PRODUCT', 'JOINT', 'MODEL']","['absolute versus relative differences', 'evaluability', 'product']","['attributes', 'reference information', 'evaluability']",0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
"Economic reform in China has attracted growing attention from around the world owing to its significance for theory and practice.

"Physician service encounters are different as they involve (1) one-on-one interactions, (2) frequent encounters with the same physician, (3) intimate exchanges, (4) substantial variability across encounters, and (5) require patient cooperation to achieve successful health outcomes.

"Innovations commonly involve changes to iterated market offerings (e.g., new games, car models, film sequels). To better understand consumer iteration responses, the authors develop and test a theoretical framework grounded in (1) prior innovations serving as reference states (comparators) for later innovations and (2) consumer desires for both comfort and stimulation. In Study 1's online game, prior innovations and loss aversion (greater loss than gain impact) moderate evaluations of current innovations, whereby an introduction-weaker-stronger innovation sequence (Periods 1-3 of four periods) generates more entertainment than an introduction-stronger-weaker sequence because the former's weak-opening-then-rise does less harm than the latter's strong-opening-then-drop. Study 2 replicates Study 1 and shows that an introduction-weaker-weaker sequence produces enough habituation and diminishing negative returns to outperforman introduction-stronger-weaker sequence at Period 4. Study 3 offers marketplace corroboration with a film industry test in which minor (fewer) innovations perform better (e.g., sales, return on investment) earlier in franchises, whereas major (many) innovations perform better later, thereby reconciling prior research's opposing prescriptions for the use of major versus minor sequel innovations.

Organizational members can and do become territorial over physical spaces, ideas, roles, relationships, and other potential possessions in organizations.

We then go on to discuss the organizational consequences of these behaviors, including their effects on organizational commitment, conflict, preoccupation, and individual isolation.","['nan', 'SIDE-BET THEORY', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP', 'COMMITMENT', 'DOMINANCE', 'IDENTITY', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'IMAGE', 'FIELD']","['commitment', 'consequences', 'behavior']",['commitment'],1.0,0.3333333333333333
"Compared with traditional offline markets, online auctions constrain all sellers to compete within a similar environment in terms of interface, functionality, and market rules. One means for sellers to differentiate themselves is through a set of listing options. One such characteristic that has received little research interest, despite its economic importance, is location options. This paper describes the findings of a field experiment that investigates whether and to what extent locations have impacts on market outcomes. We auctioned 120 products in matched pairs at a public auction site, both as featured (i.e., items listed in the first page of search results) and as default (i.e., items listed after featured) listings using both low-priced and higher-priced products. Consistent with the effort minimization approach to decision making and the primacy effect, the products sold under featured listings received more visits, more bids, and sold for higher prices than the products sold under default listings. There was no evidence of the impact of a product price level-location interaction for the final price: buyers of both low-priced and higher-priced products were equally affected by featured listings. Our follow-up survey suggests that buyers did not have the ability to perform an exhaustive search to find the lowest price. The results imply that sellers can enjoy price premiums through featured listings and that development of better shopbots by third-party vendors is greatly needed for buyers.","['Auction-listing location', 'cost-benefit theories of cognition', 'elaboration likelihood model', 'featured listing', 'field experiment', 'online auction', 'ELECTRONIC MARKETS', 'TRUST', 'REPUTATION', 'CONSUMER', 'MARKETPLACES', 'COMPETITION', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'STRATEGIES', 'PREMIUMS', 'QUALITY']","['featured listing', 'field experiment', 'online auction', 'premiums']","['online auctions', 'listing options', 'field experiment', 'effort minimization', 'decision making']",0.2,0.25
"We offer a method of analysis that allows for an unbundling of the data to a disaggregate household level, and then rebundling it in a manner designed to identify patterns and relationships which are otherwise masked. Applying the method in the context of 'healthy' products and using census block group level data, we study consumption over several categories in two locations. The analyses show that studies involving geographically dispersed data must test for, and take into account when required, conceptually sound spatial effects in order to accurately assess impact. We also show that while both location and the product category have a significant impact on the proportion of healthy products purchased, the degree to which consumers choose healthier alternatives is a function of the category as well as the location. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence from survey data that supports the variations we find, and further explores attitudinal differences as well. There are rich implications for retailers in that new products introduced to benefit from popular trends (such as 'healthy' alternatives) may not succeed for all categories or locations. Retailers would benefit from understanding the spatial, demographic and attitudinal effects that play into consumption behavior, and such effects can be better understood when studying choice at the category and region level. Finally, public policies aimed at promoting healthier purchasing habits may have greater impact if special attention is given to specific categories and regions. (C) 2010 New York University.

"This study investigates the effects of customer contact frequency and relationship duration on customer-reported relationship strength (CRRS). We embed our analysis of these two relationship-quantity variables within a larger model that considers the effects of relationship-quality variables-commitment, trust and satisfaction-on CRRS. We additionally control for customer demographics and service type. Using a fully national sample of 591 service consumers, we find that both contact frequency and relationship duration have a positive effect on CRRS, and that duration moderates the effect of frequency. Specifically, we observe a relationship-maturity effect: for shorter-duration relationships, contact frequency enhances CRRS, but for longer-duration relationships, contact frequency has no effect on CRRS. Furthermore, employing an iso-contact analysis, we find that for relationships with about the same number of total contacts, those with longer duration are perceived to be stronger, while those with greater contact frequency are not.","['service relationship', 'relationship strength', 'relationship duration', 'contact frequency', 'BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS', 'RELATIONSHIP QUALITY', 'BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS', 'CHANNEL RELATIONSHIPS', 'PREFERENCE REVERSALS', 'SEPARATE EVALUATIONS', 'SATISFACTION', 'TRUST', 'LOYALTY', 'PERFORMANCE']","['relationship strength', 'relationship duration', 'contact frequency', 'relationship quality', 'satisfaction', 'trust']","['customer contact frequency', 'relationship duration', 'customer reported relationship strength', 'commitment trust', 'satisfaction', 'consumers', 'maturity', 'iso contact analysis']",0.25,0.3333333333333333

"Research summary: Strategic alliances are undertaken to create value through complementarities of resources and capabilities of the partner firms. This paper uses a recently developed estimator of matching games, i.e., the maximum score estimator, to advance strategic management research on partner selection in strategic alliances, with a focus on the formation of research alliances in the biopharmaceutical industry. We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we develop a matching framework to study strategic alliances, taking a market perspective that explicitly incorporates key features of alliance formation: two-sided decision making; quest for complementarities between indivisible and heterogeneous partner attributes; and competition on each side of the market for partners on the other side of the market. Second, we assess the relative performance of the maximum score and standard discrete choice estimators by performing simulations based on known functional relationships in various matching scenarios. Third, within the context of biopharmaceutical research alliances, we hypothesize and find support using the maximum score estimator for complementarity in partner size and in upstream research capabilities.Managerial summary: A critical question facing managers who seek to benefit from strategic alliances is whom to ally with. Typically, each party seeks a partner whose attributes reinforce their own. This paper explains that the interaction of these preferences leads to a market-wide sorting of alliance partners. Since the value created by an alliance is driven by attributes of all alliance partners, firms cannot successfully bid financial resources to get access to their most preferred partner. Instead, managers need to understand the market-wide competition and invest in the right mixture of attributes to make their firm more attractive in the market for alliance partners. Using this framework, we highlight firms' sizes and research capabilities as two drivers of partner selection and sorting in bio-pharmaceutical research alliances.

"Many consumer products deliver their utility over time, and the decision to purchase such products often depends on predictions of future product enjoyment. The present research shows that consumers often fail to predict hedonic adaptation to products and explores the antecedents and consequences of this misprediction. We demonstrate that the failure to predict diminishing enjoyment with a product arises because of a failure to spontaneously consider adaptation and apply correct intuitive beliefs about adaptation. We further show that making prospective duration salient can cue beliefs about hedonic adaptation. Finally, we find that these beliefs, once cued, influence choices.","['nan', 'RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS', 'DURABILITY BIAS', 'EXPERIENCES', 'CONSUMPTION', 'NEGLECT', 'CHOICE', 'LESS', 'TIME']","['choice', 'time']",[],0,0.0
"Planning new product development (NPD) activities is becoming increasingly difficult, as contemporary businesses compete at the level of business ecosystems in addition to the firm-level product-market competition. These business ecosystems are built around platforms interlinking suppliers, complementors, distributors, developers, etc. together. The competitiveness of these ecosystems relies on members utilizing the shared platform for their own performance improvement, especially in terms of developing new valuable offerings for end users. Therefore, managing the development of the platform-based applications and gaining timely end-user input for NPD are of vital importance both to the ecosystem as a whole and to the developers. Subsequently, to succeed in NPD planning developers utilizing beta testing need a thorough understanding of the adoption dynamics of beta products. Developers need to plan for example resource allocation; development costs; and timing of commercial, end-product launches. Therefore, the anticipation of the adoption dynamics of beta products emerges as an important antecedent in planning NPD activities when beta testing is used for gaining end-user input to the NPD process. Consequently, we investigate how free beta software products that are built upon software platforms diffuse among their end users in a cocreation community. We specifically study whether the adoption of these beta products follows Bass or Gompertz model dynamics used in the previous literature when modeling the adoption of stand-alone products. Further, we also investigate the forecasting abilities of these two models. Our results show that the adoption dynamics of free beta products in a cocreation community follow Gompertz's model rather than the Bass model. Additionally, we find that the Gompertz model performs better than the Bass model in forecasting both short and long out-of-sample time periods. We further discuss the managerial and research implications of our study.","['nan', 'VIRTUAL CUSTOMER ENVIRONMENTS', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'NETWORK EXTERNALITIES', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'DIFFUSION-MODELS', 'VALUE CREATION', 'INNOVATION', 'COMMUNITIES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SOFTWARE']","['product development', 'performance', 'software']","['product development', 'ecosystems', 'performance', 'software']",0.75,1.0
"This research examines the interaction of two cues, retailer reputation and guarantees on evaluations. Extending Mandler's (1982) incongruity framework, we illustrate across three studies how moderately incongruent signals can be combined to enhance evaluations. Unique to our application of moderate incongruity, however, is the fact that guarantee cues can be incongruent with the retailer's reputation, in terms of domain (e g, price matching guarantee (PMG) offered by provider whose reputation is based on service, not pricing) or valence (e.g., PMG offered by retailer known for carrying expensive merchandize). This dual perspective on the source of incongruity (domain or valence) is important and highlights when guarantees enhance evaluations. (C) 2013 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Research summary: Among the most difficult firm strategic choices is the trade-off between making a long-term commitment or holding off on investment in the face of uncertainty. To operationalize strategic management theory under demand, technological and competitive uncertainty, we develop a Strategic Net Present Value (NPV) framework that integrates real options and game theory to quantify value components and interactions at the interface between NPV, real options, and strategic games. Our approach results in new propositions clarifying the way learning-experience conditions, technological uncertainty, and proprietary information interact to tilt the balance in the interplay between wait-and-see flexibility and strategic commitment. As such, Strategic NPV adds to our understanding of the conditions where NPV, real options, or strategic thinking are more relevant.Managerial summary: This study develops and elucidates implementation of a new valuation construct, Strategic Net Present Value (NPV), that integrates real options and game theory to more accurately portray strategic decisions underlying management theory.

"A paper in one of the quality journals of Management Studies is much more important as a unit of measurement than as a contribution to knowledge. It measures academic performance and determines much academic funding. There is consequently some pressure to publish in quality journals. But quality journals are defined in terms that are themselves defined in terms of quality journals - a circularity that explains both the paper's title and the frustration of those who do not mix in these circles. We examine the gamesmanship of publishing in quality journals. Findings from a survey of heads of Management Studies departments in UK universities suggest that such gamesmanship is common. Cunning and calculation now support scholarship in Management Studies. Gamesmanship will remain common until the rewards for publishing attach to the content of papers, to what is published rather than where it is published. We propose a 'Tinkerbell Solution': without belief in the value of a paper in a quality journal, the game is no longer worth playing.","['nan', 'RESEARCH ASSESSMENT EXERCISE', 'INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY', 'R-AND-R', 'CITATION ANALYSIS', 'BUSINESS SCHOOLS', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'RESEARCH SELECTIVITY', 'UK UNIVERSITIES', 'PROPER ROLES', 'REFLECTIONS']",['uk universities'],['performance'],0.0,0.0

Survey data from high technology companies in China demonstrate that the effects of knowledge breadth and depth are contingent on market knowledge acquisition and knowledge sharing in opposite ways. In particular, a firm with a broad knowledge base is more likely to achieve radical innovation in the presence of internal knowledge sharing rather than market knowledge acquisition. In contrast, a firm with a deep knowledge base is more capable of developing radical innovation through market knowledge acquisition rather than internal knowledge sharing.

"Although much of the existing research on employee sabotage and deviance focuses on the manufacturing sector studies have also found evidence of deliberate employee misbehavior in a variety of service settings. In this study, the authors conceptualize and test a model of service sabotage dynamics that incorporates both the antecedents and the consequences of such behaviors. In doing so, the study contributes contemporary empirical evidence of factors associated with the deliberate sabotage of service by frontline customer-contact personnel. Using a survey-based approach, the authors collected data from 259 respondents from a sample of 1,000 respondents. The findings largely support the hypothesized antecedents of service sabotage and show that a range of individual characteristics, management control efforts, and perceived labor market conditions are linked with service sabotage. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that service sabotage behaviors are associated with individual and group rewards, effects for customers, and other performance measures.","['service sabotage', 'employee deviance', 'service dysfunction', 'frontline employees', 'customer-contact employees', 'CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS', 'FIT INDEXES', 'MANAGEMENT', 'CULTURE', 'EMPLOYEES', 'STRATEGY', 'ORIENTATION', 'PERSONALITY', 'COMMITMENT', 'RESISTANCE']","['service sabotage', 'management']",['sabotage'],0.0,0.0

"While previous research has investigated structural hole positions through single-level models, describing their positive effects, this article elaborates a multilevel model and supports an antithetical position, revealing a dark side of structural holes. Although individual-level structural holes are supposed to exercise positive effects, it is theorized that group-level mean and group-level variance in structural hole positions are negatively associated with individual outcomes. The argument that justifies the aforementioned negative association is that the individualistic, competitive, manipulative and power-oriented behaviors of employees occupying structural hole positions may be beneficial when considering independent individuals, but, instead, they create frictions and problems when it comes to group functioning and group climate. This article provides evidence that group composition variables exercise a constraining effect on individuals, making them perceive less autonomy, and negatively affect satisfaction and performance.

By knowing more, multitechnology firms can coordinate loosely coupled networks of suppliers of equipment, components, and specialized knowledge and maintain a capability for systems integration. Networks enable them to benefit from the advantages of both integration and specialization.

The focus is on what drives the MNC subsidiary's ability to absorb marketing strategies that are initiated by the MNC parent, as well as how the subsidiary enacts on this absorptive capacity in order to compete in its focal market. The dual embeddedness of MNC subsidiaries plays a key role in this investigation, as subsidiaries belong to the MNC network and are simultaneously embedded in their host country environment. We argue that subsidiary absorptive capacity is formed as a purposeful response to this dual embeddedness.

It employs the empirical example of the rise of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in Austria between 1990 and 2005 to investigate the complex role institutional pressures and social positions of actors play in the local adoption of globally theorized ideas. More specifically, the study reveals distinct patterns in rhetorical CSR adoption that illustrate the initial hesitation and reluctance of an established elite in the Austrian business community towards the Anglo-American notion of explicit' CSR, while non-elite actors who were less favourably positioned in the social order readily embraced the concept. It is in such a sense that CSR is nevertheless instrumentalized to challenge, reinterpret, or explicitly evoke the autochthonous idea of institutionalized social solidarity.

An unresolved question, however, is the extent to which such relationships protect incumbent suppliers from new competitors and their marketing programs. The authors develop a conceptual framework of how relationship and marketing variables influence choice of supplier and test the framework empirically in the context of business-to-business services. The results show that interpersonal relationships between buyers and suppliers serve as a switching barrier but are considerably less important than both firm-level switching costs and marketing variables. Moreover, unlike switching costs, interpersonal relationships do not play the frequently mentioned role of a buffer against price and product competition.

Distrust, rooted in value incongruence, more readily generalizes across exchange contexts. Results support these predictions. In addition, our analysis shows that trust and distrust combine such that managers decrease their preferences for highly specific focal-context contracts only when in-context trust is high and distrust is low.

"While effective HR services and programs can help firms gain competitive advantage, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) often lack the internal resources required to develop and deliver these services and programs. As a result, SMEs increasingly are outsourcing HR activities to professional employer organizations (PEOs). Questions remain, however, about the conditions under which SMEs will benefit from outsourcing HR to a PEO, as well as about the type of benefits that are potentially available. The very nature of many HR activities raises questions about the risks associated with market governance and a PEO's ability to ensure service quality for SMEs. In order for these questions to be addressed, it is necessary to understand the process by which PEO utilization affects SME outcomes. In this article, we use transaction cost economics, social exchange theory, and the strategic HR literature to develop a framework for understanding the factors and conditions likely to affect whether and how an SME will benefit from using a PEO.","['nan', 'HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT', 'TRUST', 'COST', 'COOPERATION', 'STRATEGY']",['cost'],[],0,0.0

"We develop and test a model of factors proposed to influence the formation of trust in R&D partnerships in two different cultures. We suggest that specific relational behaviors (communication quality, fairness, and unresolved conflicts) impact trust formation and that national culture has a direct and a moderating effect on trust development. Results of a study of 100 vertical product development partnerships in South Korea and Austria show that communication quality and fairness have a positive effect and unresolved conflicts have a negative effect on the amount of trust developed. We also find a lower amount of trust developed in South Korean partnerships compared to partnerships conducted in Austria. In Austria, the positive effect of communication quality and the negative effect of unresolved conflicts on trust formation are stronger than in South Korea. Overall, the impact of the three relational factors is much stronger than the direct and moderating influence of national culture in the R&D partnerships studied, indicating that the relational elements of trust formation might be more universal than country specific.

"Whereas past research showed that people rely more on alignable than nonalignable differences when evaluating alternative products, the current article shows that consumer expertise moderates this effect and that novices' reliance on alignable attributes can be attenuated when they are motivated or are provided with category knowledge. The authors conducted four experiments to test their hypotheses. Participants considered nonalignable (vs. alignable) attributes to be more differentiating between two competing brands, especially among experts (study 1). In addition, compared to novices, experts more actively sought out nonalignable attributes (study 2) and relied more on nonalignable than alignable attributes when making brand choice decisions (studies 3 and 4). Consistent with the hypothesis that experts' processing of nonalignable attributes is driven by their deeper motivation and knowledge, enhancing motivation (study 3) and the knowledge base (study 4) among novices led to their increased use of a nonalignable attribute as the basis of judgment.","['nan', 'PREFERENCE CONSTRUCTION', 'STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT', 'COMPARATIVE JUDGMENT', 'REGULATORY FOCUS', 'UNIQUE FEATURES', 'CONSUMER CHOICE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'SIMILARITY', 'STRATEGIES', 'BEHAVIOR']",['knowledge'],"['category knowledge', 'brands', 'choice', 'judgment']",0.0,0.0
"Our paper presents an empirical analysis of entrepreneurial well-being using a large-scale longitudinal household survey from the UK that tracks almost 50,000 individuals across seven waves over the period 2009-2017, as well as a number of exploratory case studies. We contribute to the existing literature by investigating how entrepreneurial well-being varies across locations along the urban-rural continuum, and across wealthy-deprived neighbourhoods. We use a Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) approach to compare the well-being outcomes of individuals who switch into self-employment from waged employment, and show that entrepreneurial well-being, in the form of job satisfaction, is significantly higher for those living in semi-urban locations, relative to those living in urban and rural locations. We argue that semi-urban locations provide an optimal combination of ease of doing business and quality of life. Our results also show that individuals in wealthy neighbourhoods who switch into self-employment experience higher job satisfaction than otherwise comparable individuals living in materially deprived neighbourhoods, although the latter experience greater levels of life satisfaction following the switch.","['Entrepreneurship', 'Well-being', 'Self-employment', 'Urban-rural', 'Neighbourhood effects', 'QUALITY-OF-LIFE', 'ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT', 'UNITED-STATES', 'SET-POINT', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'HAPPINESS', 'URBAN', 'INCOME', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERSISTENCE']","['well being', 'self employment', 'urban rural', 'quality of life', 'urban']","['entrepreneurial well being', 'cem', 'self employment', 'job satisfaction']",0.25,0.2
"Effectuation was first proposed as an expert entrepreneur's decision-making framework under uncertainty, but the applications of effectuation beyond the condition of uncertainty have seen less attention. Using an agent-based simulation model, this paper investigates the effectiveness of effectuation relative to causation in uncertain and risky contexts. The simulation overcomes the shortcomings of think aloud protocols typically used in effectuation research. The results suggest that effectuation outperforms causation in both risky and uncertain contexts until the entrepreneur can predict the future correctly > 75% of the time. This suggests expanding the boundary of effectuation from uncertainty to whenever predicting the future is challenging.","['Effectuation', 'Causation', 'Uncertainty', 'Decision-making', 'Simulation model', 'BOUNDED RATIONALITY', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION', 'DESIGNING ORGANIZATIONS', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'MARKET PROCESS', 'BRICOLAGE', 'SEARCH', 'EXPLORATION', 'ADAPTATION']","['effectuation', 'causation', 'uncertainty', 'decision making', 'simulation model', 'decision making', 'search']","['uncertainty', 'causation']",1.0,0.2857142857142857
"Many scholars across various academic disciplines are investigating the following questions: What do individuals know or believe about an organization? How does a focal organization (and/or other interested entity) develop, use, and/or change this information? and How do individuals respond to what they know or believe about an organization? Cross-disciplinary research that centers on these questions is desirable and could be enhanced if researchers identify and develop consistent terminology for framing these questions.

"Materialists believe that acquiring products will make them happier, but the validity of this premise has not been examined empirically. In this research, two cross-sectional and one longitudinal studies examine the emotions evoked by products before and after purchase. High-materialism consumers consistently showed hedonic elevation in product-evoked emotions before purchase, followed by hedonic decline after purchase. Low-materialism consumers, however, did not display this pattern. Findings show that hedonic elevation appears to be due to expectations among high-materialism consumers that purchase of the desired product will transform their lives in significant and meaningful ways. Findings further indicate that satisfaction processes may partially explain the hedonic decline that follows purchase among high-materialism consumers but also suggest that for these consumers, the state of anticipating and desiring a product may be inherently more pleasurable than product ownership itself.","['nan', 'CONSUMPTION', 'VALUES', 'HAPPINESS', 'SCALE', 'HAPPY', 'DETERMINANTS', 'SATISFACTION', 'TENDENCIES', 'APPRAISAL', 'PATTERNS']",['satisfaction'],"['materialism', 'satisfaction']",0.5,1.0
"We examine whether corporate governance matters more for firms facing financial distress. We theorize that financial crisis changes the relative costs and benefits of governance mechanisms and that more independent and smaller boards become more valuable in distressed firms. We further hypothesize that CEO power becomes increasingly beneficial as concentrated power allows the firm to respond more rapidly to the crisis. Event-history analysis of the failure of publicly traded Internet firms over the period 2000-2002 confirms our hypotheses.

"This research examines the effectiveness of public recognition in encouraging charitable giving, demonstrating that public recognition can sometimes decrease donations. While previous work has largely shown that making donations visible to others can motivate donors, the present research shows that the effectiveness of public recognition depends on whether potential donors are under an independent (i.e., separate from others) or interdependent (i.e., connected with others) self-construal. Across seven experimental studies, an independent self-construal decreases donation intentions and amounts when the donor will receive public recognition compared to when the donation will remain private. This effect is driven by the activation of an agentic motive, wherein independents are motivated to make decisions that are guided by their own goals and self-interests, rather than being influenced by the opinions and expectations of others. This research contributes to the understanding of the nuanced roles of both public recognition and self-construal in predicting donation behavior.","['self-construal', 'charitable donations', 'public recognition', 'agency', 'PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR', 'CULTURAL VARIATION', 'IDENTITY', 'INDIVIDUALISM', 'RESPONSES', 'APPEALS', 'COLLECTIVISM', 'ENHANCEMENT', 'CONSUMPTION', 'INCENTIVES']","['self construal', 'public recognition']","['self construal', 'self construal', 'donation intentions', 'behavior']",0.25,0.5
"Consumers often purchase consumer durables without using these products beforehand. Product appearance is then one of the factors that consumers use to form inferences about the experience and credence attributes of consumer durables. For companies, it is important to successfully manage these inference processes of consumers to create a competitive advantage. However, a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between product appearance and the inferences about products' experience and credence attributes is lacking. This research provides empirically based, generalizable guidelines to assist companies with selecting the product appearance of consumer durables to trigger strategically valued experience and credence attributes. An empirical analysis of 120 consumer durables, belonging to four product categories on 31 design characteristics identifies five design dimensions (i.e., harmony, novelty, natural, weight, compressed) that differentiate product appearances of consumer durables. Furthermore, the findings show that these design dimensions relate to perceptions of performance quality, ease of use, and technological advancement. Specifically, product appearances that score high on harmony, neutral on novelty, and somewhat above neutral on weight trigger the most positive performance quality perceptions. Product appearances that score high on natural, low on novelty, and neutral on compressed trigger the most positive ease of use perceptions. Novel and nonnatural appearances prompt positive inferences about technological advancement. These findings are integrated into a discussion of the managerial implications and the potential avenues for future research on product appearance.","['nan', 'PERCEIVED PERFORMANCE QUALITY', 'AESTHETIC PREFERENCE', 'PACKAGE DESIGN', 'FORM', 'RESPONSES', 'SHAPE', 'INFORMATION', 'ATTRIBUTES', 'TYPICALITY', 'INNOVATION']","['form', 'attributes']",[],0,0.0

This paper provides an historical perspective on these developments and offers an examination of the fundamental role of societal interests in our field. Six basic topics are explored: (1) the hundred years of history of marketing thought development, as reflected in the 4 Eras of marketing thought; (2) the ebbs and flows of attention to marketing in society topics during these 4 Eras; (3) two illustrations of difficulties brought about by this area's move to sideline status in the field; (4) our concept of the aggregate marketing system as a basis for appreciating the centrality of this research area for the field of marketing; (5) the nature of marketing in society research today; and (6) a discussion of several research challenges and opportunities for the future.","['Marketing history', 'Academic marketing', 'Marketing in society', 'Definition of marketing', 'Public policy research', 'Aggregate marketing system', 'OF-PUBLIC-POLICY', 'BROADENING CONCEPT', 'DEFINITION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'THOUGHT']","['marketing in society', 'aggregate marketing system', 'perspective', 'thought']",['aggregate marketing system'],1.0,0.25

"This paper reviews empirical research on top management team (TMT) diversity. A number of scholars have concluded that upper echelons findings, in particular in terms of the consequences of TMT heterogeneity, have been inconclusive. This review conducts an in-depth analysis of conceptual and methodological issues related to upper echelons diversity studies and offers some directions for future research. Sixty journal articles, published in ten top international journals over a 22-year period (1984-2005), were analyzed. The results suggest that upper echelons research is increasingly multidisciplinary in nature; however, in-depth inquiries into the antecedents of TMT composition and the multilevel contextual influences on the implications of TMT heterogeneity are still needed. This review finds that clarity about level of analysis, both theoretically and empirically, remains an important issue in the field and thus a multilevel approach is strongly encouraged. Moreover, the complexity of diversity as a theoretical construct needs to be acknowledged and operationalized accordingly in upper echelons studies.","['nan', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL DEMOGRAPHY', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'SOCIAL-CONTEXT', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'HETEROGENEITY', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'EXPERIENCE']","['upper echelons', 'heterogeneity']","['diversity', 'upper echelons', 'heterogeneity', 'studies']",0.5,1.0
"Consumers' conceptions of a market's institutional logic affect mechanisms of firm-consumer relationships, but are generally neglected in comparative studies of international marketing. This study bridges institutional and relationship marketing theories to examine two questions: do consumers hold meaningful mental models of a market's institutional logics, and do these mental models explain differentiated patterns of market relationships across international contexts? Building on contract-relational duality, we develop a market-level construct for capturing consumers' socially constructed mental models for the institutional logics of market action. We theorize that differences in consumers' institutional logics will influence both their evaluation of a firm's capabilities (first-order effect) and the degree to which they reward a firm through their commitment (second-order effect). These bridging predictions are tested using data from the insurance industry across three international markets. Our results show that the German insurance market is located in the relatively high contracts-low relational quadrant, whereas the US and Dutch markets are both located in the relatively low contracts - high relational quadrant. Our results also suggest that consumer commitment conforms to a principle of alignment such that commitment accrues to providers who align their capabilities with consumers' prevalent institutional logics of the market, and penalizes those who deviate from it.

The integrative framework proposed in this study addresses the nature of UD and pursues theoretical richness and computational advancements by integrating insights from other disciplines. This article makes three main contributions to the literature by (1) offering a unifying definition and conceptualization of UD in marketing; (2) bridging disjoint literature with an organizing framework that synthesizes various subsets of UD relevant for marketing management through an integrative review; and (3) identifying substantive, computational, and theoretical gaps in extant literature and ways to leverage interdisciplinary knowledge to advance marketing research by applying UD analyses to underdeveloped areas.","['Unstructured data', 'Machine learning', 'Deep learning', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Nonverbal', 'Image', 'Video', 'Voice', 'Text', 'Linguistics', 'Acoustic', 'Big data', 'Text mining', 'WORD-OF-MOUTH', 'USER-GENERATED CONTENT', 'ONLINE CUSTOMER REVIEWS', 'SOCIAL MEDIA', 'SPEECH CHARACTERISTICS', 'BRAND INFORMATION', 'SHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'TEXT ANALYSIS', 'BIG DATA', 'IMPACT']",['unstructured data'],"['unstructured data', 'integrative framework']",0.5,1.0
"Research summary We investigate how multimarket contact between prospective partners affects their partner selection for technology cooperation. Drawing on the multimarket competition literature, we argue that multimarket contact generates mutual forbearance from opportunism by enabling broad retaliation across the shared markets against opportunism. As a result, multimarket contact between potential partners makes them prefer each other as partners for technology cooperation. We also claim that this positive effect of multimarket contact on the formation of cooperative agreements is more pronounced when the partners have reciprocal contacts rather than nonreciprocal ones. Managerial summary This article explains one of the reasons why rival firms can be good partners to each other for technology cooperation. Managers might conjecture that firms tend to avoid partnering with rival firms for R&D because they may be more opportunistic than those without product market overlap. However, our theory suggests a counter-intuitive argument that market overlap between partners rather deters them from engaging in opportunistic behaviors because market overlap enables them to broadly retaliate against such behaviors across the shared product markets. Consistent with this idea, our empirical results show that global top 200 biopharmaceutical companies are more likely to choose each other for technology cooperation as they share more product markets and this tendency is reinforced when their important markets are different.","['multimarket contact', 'mutual forbearance', 'opportunism', 'partner selection', 'technology cooperation', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'INTERFIRM COOPERATION', 'MARKET COMPETITION', 'GOVERNANCE', 'SIMILARITY', 'ESTIMATOR', 'CHOICE', 'COMPLEMENTARITY', 'COLLABORATION']","['multimarket contact', 'mutual forbearance', 'opportunism', 'partner selection', 'technology cooperation', 'market competition']","['multimarket contact', 'technology cooperation', 'multimarket competition', 'mutual forbearance', 'opportunism', 'markets', 'firms']",0.5714285714285714,0.6666666666666666
"Recent findings on the brain's anatomy suggest that there are modality-specific resources for the processing of language.

Three experiments compare unimodal to multimedia messages containing either a mix of modalities or information presented bimodally. The results provide qualified support far the model in the realm of item-specific Versus relational memory and elaboration.

Furthermore, a simultaneous bimodal presentation format increases recognition memory but does not appear to affect relational processing or item-specific elaboration.","['nan', 'MODALITY', 'MEMORY', 'RECALL', 'ITEM', 'INTERFERENCE']","['modality', 'memory', 'item', 'interference']","['multimedia', 'memory']",0.5,0.25
"A new model of managerial problem formulation is introduced and developed to answer the question: 'What kinds of problems do strategic managers engage in solving and why?' The article proposes that a key decision metric for choosing among alternative problem statements is the computational complexity of the solution algorithm of alternative statements. Managerial problem statements are grouped into two classes on the basis of their computational complexity: P-type problems (canonically easy ones) and NP-type problems (hard ones). The new model of managerial cognitive choice posits that managers prefer to engage with and solve P-type problems over solving NP-type problems. The model explains common patterns of managerial reasoning and decision making, including many documented 'biases' and simplifying heuristics, and points the way to new, effects and novel empirical investigations of problem solving-oriented thinking in strategic management and types of generic strategies, driven by predictions about the kinds of market- and industry-level changes that managers will or will not respond to.

"Purpose - The purpose of this article is to explore themes and challenges in making supply chains environmentally sustainable. Design/methodology/approach - The study began with a systematic review, and content analysis of articles in top-ranking related journals from logistics, transport, sustainability and environmental areas, and ended with research propositions contributing to the further advancement of supply chain management. Findings - The findings illustrate the major themes published in 18 journals concentrating on sustainable supply chains with special focus on environmental issues. From the systematic review five major areas of challenges for supply chain management are derived: costs, complexity, operationalisation, mindset and cultural changes, and uncertainties. From all of these areas synthesising discussions are provided and research propositions suggested. It is concluded that there is a great need for models and frameworks that consider the complexity involved, take holistic perspectives, and challenge the basic assumptions underlying most of the research published (i.e. reductionism, positivism and economic growth). Research limitations/implications - Sustainability in this article is mainly related to environmental issues. Analysis of complex interactions between environmental, social and economic aspects might provide opportunities for future research. Practical implications - The results presented in this paper provide a systematic structure for classifying issues related to logistics sustainability; something which will be beneficial for managers and policy-makers when they approach sustainable supply chain management challenges. Originality/value - This paper provides propositions for research based on the emergent outcome of challenges that can guide research, industry and policy-makers in future sustainability efforts.","['Environment', 'Logistics', 'Transport operations', 'Supply chain management', 'Sustainability', 'Research', 'Sustainable development', 'CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK', 'AIR-POLLUTION', 'TRANSPORT', 'MANAGEMENT', 'IMPACTS', 'POLICY', 'PROCUREMENT', 'SCENARIOS', 'PROGRESS', 'ISSUES']","['environment', 'logistics', 'supply chain management', 'sustainability', 'research', 'transport', 'management', 'policy', 'issues']","['sustainability', 'supply chain management']",1.0,0.2222222222222222

"Emerging market firms (EMFs) are increasingly relying on innovation to find their competitive advantage, but our understanding of how institutional change affects firm innovation has been limited. We analyzed Korean manufacturing firms from 1994 to 2006 to test the proposition that market-oriented institutional change in an emerging economy alleviates firms' financing constraints and monitoring problems and improves the effectiveness of their innovation activities. Institutional evolution in the economy was found to affect Korean business groups and independent firms differently. Institutional change reduced the financing constraints on independent firms more than for business group affiliates in R&D investment. Independent firms, however, appeared less capable than group affiliates of translating the benefits of improved institutional environments into efficient R&D investment. This asymmetry may lead to a wider gap in the efficiency of R&D investment between business group affiliates and independent firms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc..

Our results suggest need rules are generally preferred by allocators, although rule preferences were affected by both the type of resource and whether the resource was being distributed rather than recovered. In particular the preference for equality rules was stronger when resources were recovered Our findings also suggest that managers may find recovery decisions more difficult than distribution decisions, and that monetary and affiliative resources are among the most difficult to allocate.

"This paper critically reviews existing contributions from the field of cultural leadership studies with a view to highlighting the conceptual and methodological limitations of the dominant etic, cross-cultural approach in leadership studies and illuminating implications of the relative dominance and unreflective use of the English language as the academic and business lingua franca within this field. It subsequently outlines the negative implications of overlooking cultural and linguistic multiplicity for an understanding of culturally sensitive leadership practices. In drawing on lessons from this critical review and the emergent fields of emic, non-positivist cultural leadership studies, this analysis argues that the field of cultural leadership studies requires an alternative research agenda focused on language multiplicity, which enables the field to move towards emic, qualitative research that helps to empower individual cultural voices and explore cultural intra- and interrelationships, tensions and paradoxes embedded in leadership processes. The paper concludes by offering suggestions on methodological approaches for emic cultural leadership studies that are centred on the exploration of language as a cultural voice.","['nan', 'ARTS-BASED METHODS', 'QUALITATIVE RESEARCH', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION', 'AFRICAN LEADERSHIP', 'PUBLIC-SECTOR', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATION', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'PERFORMANCE']",['qualitative research'],[],0,0.0
"Marketing planners often use geographical information systems (GISs) to help identify suitable retail locations, regionally distribute advertising campaigns, and target direct marketing activities. Geographical information systems thematic maps facilitate the visual assessment of map regions. A broad set of alternative symbolizations, such as circles, bars, or shading, can be used to visually represent quantitative geospatial data on such maps. However, there is little knowledge on which kind of symbolization is the most adequate in which problem situation. In a large-scale experimental study, the authors show that the type of symbolization strongly influences decision performance. The findings indicate that graduated circles are appropriate symbolizations for geographical information systems thematic maps, and their successful utilization seems to be virtually independent of personal characteristics, such as spatial ability and map experience. This makes circle symbolizations particularly suitable for effective decision making and cross-functional communication.","['data visualization', 'spatial marketing decisions', 'symbolization', 'geographical information systems thematic maps', 'cartograms', 'SUPPORT SYSTEMS', 'TASK COMPLEXITY', 'TIME PRESSURE', 'COGNITIVE FIT', 'DETERMINANTS', 'SEARCH', 'TABLES']","['symbolization', 'geographical information systems thematic maps']","['maps', 'performance']",0.0,0.0

"In this paper, we compare two alternative financing strategies that capital-constrained entrepreneurs can adopt: they can either wait until they raised enough money to complete their project (the more conservative strategy) or use limited resources to achieve some intermediate milestone before contacting large outside investors such as venture capitalists (the more adventurous strategy). We examine how the choice of financing strategy is affected by entrepreneurial types (life-style, serial and pure profit-maximizing entrepreneur). We show that specific entrepreneurial characteristics may ultimately affect the shape of firms as they may pursue different strategies to achieve similar goals. The paper generates a number of empirical predictions on security design, the interplay between angel and venture capital finance, and the professionalization of the venture capital market.

"Visual appeal is an important consideration in the design of brand packages because attractiveness guides behavior. The visual complexity of a context (i.e., the quantity, irregularity, detail, and dissimilarity of objects) in which a retailer displays a package may impact its attractiveness by influencing attention and processing fluency. Employing consumer samples, and stimuli ranging from the abstract to the realistic, three studies provide evidence that people process a package more fluently, thus increasing its attractiveness, when it is presented in a low rather than high complexity context. This effect is more pronounced with inherently appealing packages, and with people who are more field-dependent or pursuing utilitarian shopping goals. Study 1 establishes effects by employing psychometric measures and abstract stimuli; study 2 corroborates findings with another product category and realistic stimuli; and study 3 complements psychometric measures with eye tracking data to demonstrate that visually more complex contexts divert viewer attention, hereby lowering processing fluency and target attractiveness. The authors discuss the theoretical contribution and strategic insights the research provides for retailers, brand managers, and designers. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"We explore the conditions under which firms are likely to pursue equity investment in new ventures as a way to source innovative ideas. We find that firms invest more in new ventures-commonly referred to as 'corporate venture capital'-in industries with weak intellectual property protection and, to some extent, in industries with high technological ferment and where complementary distribution capability is important. Furthermore, we find that the greater a firm's cash flow and absorptive capacity, the more likely it is to invest.

"When a company operates outside of its home country, it may suffer a `liability of foreignness.' Does this a priori theoretical expectation hold in the global banking industry? Banks increasingly compete outside of their home countries, and operating environments often differ sharply across countries, both in terms of financial markets and credit risk. In this paper, we report the results of an empirical test of the liability of foreignness in the global banking industry, using Fitch-IBCA BankScope data for the period 1989-96. Our findings strongly support the liability of foreignness hypothesis. Further, the data show some evidence that the X-efficiency of a foreign-owned bank is strongly influenced by the competitiveness of its home country and the host country in which it operates. Lastly, we find that in some environments U.S.-owned banks are more X-efficient than other foreign-owned banks in some environments, but less X-efficient in others.

"Despite the rapid and dramatic changes in the structure of the American family over the past 30 years (e.g., divorce, single parenting), consumer researchers have largely neglected the issue of how alternative family forms influence consumer behavior, Our initial inquiry into this area finds that young adults reared in disrupted families are more materialistic and exhibit higher levels of compulsive consumption than young adults reared in intact families. Furthermore, we show that the relationship between family structure and compulsive consumption is partially mediated by both the amount of resources available within the family and the degree of family stress. We also find that the impact of family disruption on family stress is moderated by socioeconomic status. We conclude by proposing an agenda for future research that considers the antecedents, processes, and consequences of alternative family structures as they relate to consumer behavior.","['nan', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'ADJUSTMENT', 'CHILDREN', 'DIVORCE', 'PARENTS', 'POSSESSIONS', 'CHILDHOOD', 'STRESS', 'VALUES', 'IMPACT']","['divorce', 'stress', 'impact']","['consumption', 'family stress']",0.0,0.0
"Research summary: Exploiting opportunities is critical to a firm's competitive advantage. Not surprisingly, there has been considerable interest in the processes by which top managers allocate attention to potential opportunities. Although such investigations have largely focused on top-down processes for allocating attention to the environment, some studies have explored bottom-up processes. In this article, we consider both top-down and bottom-up processing to develop a model by which top managers form opportunity beliefs for strategic action depending on the allocation of transient and sustained attention. Specifically, this attentional model provides insights into how a top manager's attention is allocated to identify potential opportunities from environmental change and explores how different modes of attentional engagement impact the likelihood of forming beliefs about radical and incremental opportunities requiring strategic action. Managerial summary: Managers are interested in noticing and exploiting opportunities because the exploitation of an opportunity represents an important strategic action. Noticing and exploiting opportunities depends on how and where top managers allocate their attention. Managers can focus attention based on their knowledge and experience or as a result of something in the environment capturing their attention. In this paper, we consider both knowledge-driven and environment-driven processes for allocating attention to form opportunity beliefs. This opportunity belief arises from a two stage process. The first stage explains how a top manager identifies environmental changes as potential opportunities. The second stage explains how the top manager forms a belief that these identified environmental changes represent a radical or incremental opportunity worthy of exploitation.

"This study operationalizes corporate sustainable development and examines its organizational determinants. Data for this project pertain to Canadian firms in the oil and gas, mining, and forestry industries from 1986 to 1995. I find that both resource-based and institutional factors influence corporate sustainable development. By exploring time-related effects, I also find that media pressures were important in early periods and resource-based opportunities endured over time. This finding challenges the assumption that firms first adopt innovations in response to technical rewards which are later institutionalized. These counter-intuitive results may be attributable to the unique characteristics of the dependent variable, corporate sustainable development.

"Due to major structural changes in the service sector many service managers are recognizing the need to continually develop new services that are timely and responsive to user needs. Thus, user input and involvement in new service development are an important area of inquiry. Although there has been a resurgence of academic and practitioner interest in new service development, there is a dearth of research on how users are involved in new service development. This study first combines insights from extant literature and exploratory, interviews with practitioners to identify four key elements of user involvement, including objectives, stages, intensity, and modes of involvement, and then investigates these four elements in 12 service firms. Based on the findings, the author develops an inventory of activities that needs to be carried out in involving users in a new service development project.","['nan', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CUSTOMER', 'INNOVATION', 'SUCCESS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'FIRMS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERSPECTIVE']",['firms'],['service development'],0.0,0.0
"In many business markets, manufacturers seek service-led growth to secure their existing positions and continue to grow in increasingly competitive environments. Using longitudinal data from 513 German mechanical engineering companies and latent growth curve modeling, this study offers a fine-grained view of the financial performance implications of industrial service strategies. By disentangling the revenue and profit implications of industrial service strategies, findings reveal that such strategies increase both the level and the growth of manufacturing firms' revenue streams. In contrast, they reduce the level but improve the growth of manufacturers' profits. Results further suggest that services supporting the clients' actions (SSC) and services supporting the supplier's product (SSP) affect performance outcomes in different ways. SSCs directly affect revenue and profit streams. In turn, SSPs display only indirect effects on financial performance mediated through SSCs. A moderator analysis identifies two organizational contingencies that facilitate service business success: Only companies with decentralized decision-making processes and a high share of loyal customers can expect favorable financial results from industrial service strategies. In summary, this research provides significant insights and managerial guidance for turning service strategies into financial successes.","['industrial service strategies', 'financial performance', ""services supporting the supplier's products (SSPs)"", ""services supporting the clients' actions (SSCs)"", 'latent growth curve modeling', 'MARKETING ORGANIZATION', 'INDIVIDUAL CHANGE', 'BUSINESS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ORIENTATION', 'TRANSITION', 'FRAMEWORK', 'PRODUCT', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'ANTECEDENTS']","['industrial service strategies', 'financial performance', 'latent growth curve modeling', 'business', 'performance', 'product', 'environments']","['growth curve', 'performance', 'industrial service strategies']",0.6666666666666666,0.2857142857142857
"Risks associated with the dissipation of intellectual property rights of foreign firms transferring technology to China have received some attention in the academic and professional, trade-based literature. An innovative Australian manufacturer and designer of large, high-speed catamaran ferries (INCAT) recently entered into a joint venture with a Hong Kong-based partner (AFAI) to manufacture ferries in China, without any formal, institutional protection of its proprietary knowledge. Key findings uncovered through an in-depth analysis of this case include the identification of novel bundles of firm-specific resources and capabilities that sustain a firm's intellectual property and, ultimately, its competitive advantage in the face of dissipation risks, and a combinative competency of the firm in creating these bundles. This study illustrates a case in which the conventional means of protecting intellectual property need not always be followed to best ensure the firm's retaining its competitive positioning in foreign markets.","['nan', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'INTERNATIONALIZATION PROCESS', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'MODEL', 'MANAGEMENT']","['competitive advantage', 'knowledge']","['property', 'china', 'advantage']",0.0,0.0
"We investigate coordination strategies in integrating distributed work. In the context of Business Process Offshoring (BPO), we analyze survey data from 126 offshored processes to understand both the sources of difficulty in integrating distributed work as well as how organizations overcome these difficulties. We find that interdependence between offshored and onshore processes can lower offshored process performance, and investing in coordination mechanisms can ameliorate the performance impact of interdependence. In particular, we outline a distinctive set of coordination mechanisms that rely on tacit coordination-and theoretically articulate and empirically show that tacit coordination mechanisms are distinct from the well-known duo of coordination strategies: building communication channels or modularizing processes to minimize the need for communication.

"Through a series of three inductive and deductive studies, I describe how spokespersons from the California cattle industry constructed and effectively used verbal accounts to manage perceptions of organizational legitimacy following controversial events. Findings of Study 1 suggest that organizational accounts are constructed by linking two forms of accounts: acknowledgments or denials, with two contents of accounts: references to institutional or technical characteristics of the organization. Findings of Studies 2 and 3 suggest that, in protecting organizational legitimacy (1) acknowledgments are more effective than denials, (2) references to institutionalized characteristics are more effective than references to technical characteristics, and (3) accounts combining acknowledgments with references to institutionalized characteristics are more effective than accounts with only one of these components. Effectiveness appears to depend on audiences' perceptions of the controversy, expertise in the area of controversy, and expectations of organizational responses. Overall, findings suggest that concepts from institutional and impression management theories may be combined to improve our understanding of organizational accounts and thus enhance models of symbolic management.","['nan', 'IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT', 'ATTRIBUTIONS', 'ILLUSIONS', 'CATEGORY', 'IMAGE']",['impression management'],[],0,0.0
"As one of the most common business practices in retailing, exclusive dealing (ED) restrictions are of great importance for business participants, academics and policy makers. Despite the rich theoretical analysis of this type of vertical restraint, evidence on the rationales of ED remains scarce. This paper uses a simple model to survey the vast theoretical literature on ED, and identifies two opposing motivations for ED contracts: anti-competitive versus efficiency-enhancing motivations. The theoretical predictions are subject to empirical investigation using unique French cross-sectional data encompassing diverse retail sectors. Our estimations provide evidence for both types of motivations for ED contracts, manifesting in different contexts. In particular, we find that the efficiency-enhancing motivation is more likely to explain the choice of ED when suppliers are less concentrated, whereas the anti -competitive motivation is present in highly standardized product markets. Moreover, our results reveal a positive linkage of ED and different types of investments, as part of branding strategy, with important retailing and marketing-related implications. In particular, we show that retailers have to be meticulous regarding the conditions of the retail contract before accepting the ED restriction, which may dampen their business efficiency in the long run.

"Business groups are a special type of enterprise system existing in almost every market economy. Member firms do not operate as isolated units in the markets but have institutionalized relationships with each other and work coherently as an entity. Groups play a central role in economies in which they operate. For Taiwan, the largest 100 groups produced one third of the GNP in the past 20 years. Why does this organizational form exist in the first place? This paper reviews three relevant theories, market-centred theories, culturalist perspective, and the institutional approach, and employs the data of 150 Taiwanese groups for the answer. The market-centred theories and the institutional arguments are examined statistically and the latter is supported by the data. Following this evidence, the Boolean comparison of group firms with non-group firms confirms that lacking a coherent core in ownership and management makes firms unable to respond to institutional incentives promptly. Finally, the structure of family ownership network in business groups refutes the cultural perspective which argues that the equal inheritance pattern of family property drives entrepreneurs to establish separate firms rather than single hierarchies. While both markets and culture play a distinct part in the story, it is regulatory institutions tl:lat lead to group formation.","['nan', 'EMERGING MARKETS', 'ECONOMY', 'FAMILY']","['economy', 'family']","['business', 'firms', 'ownership']",0.0,0.0
"Entrepreneurial action is embedded within a variety of complex social structures, not all of which can be as easily defined or measured as macro-institutional or micro-individual characteristics. Nonetheless, these multilayered structures collectively hold rich insights-before now underexamined-into the actual causal mechanisms that affect entrepreneurial actions and outcomes. To address this problem, we call on researchers to broaden their levels of analysis and direct their focus to meso-level structures. Although meso-level social structures are widely studied independently, these intermediate levels are seldom integrated into existing multilevel models. We argue that meso-level structures offer untapped riches for enhancing multilevel entrepreneurial mechanisms and discuss how social groups, associations, and other collectives operating at a meso level can play a more distinct, integrative role between the two ends of the institutional spectrum. To provide practical guidance for pursuing such investigations, we adapt Coleman's bathtub model to form a robust framework that integrates micro, meso, and macro levels of analysis. Our framework helps alleviate the shortcomings produced by an overdependence on either solely macro- or micro-level entrepreneurial mechanisms and offers fresh insights, as the intermediate level is more deeply integrated into this new framework.","['nan', 'SOCIAL-STRUCTURE', 'STARTING BUSINESSES', 'ECONOMIC-ACTION', 'UNITED-STATES', 'NETWORKS', 'FIELDS', 'CAUSAL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INTENTIONS', 'PROTECTION']","['social structure', 'causal']","['social structures', 'multilevel', 'social groups']",0.0,0.0
"This study explores the contingencies relating firm experience to product development capabilities, focusing on experience type (breadth versus depth) and timing (prior versus concurrent). Results from empirical tests in the U.S. mutual fund industry offer two primary findings. First, firms increase proficiency at adapting their processes to address new opportunities as they accumulate experience in entering new niches, but face initial hurdles broadening their experience base. Second, concurrent learning is capacity constrained, as product quality increases in the number of products introduced simultaneously in one niche, but quality decreases as the firm's concurrent portfolio of new products broadens. Jointly, these findings highlight that dynamic capabilities are built through prior adaptation experience and that management of a product development portfolio is an important managerial capability.

"Building on general systems theory, we argue that the multi-system nature of the international joint venture (IJV) drives two distinct but inter-related sets of human resource (HR) issues: a set whose core is mainly within the venture subsystem (within-IJV HR set), producing a detrimental impact on venture performance; and a set associated mainly with the relational tension along the interface between the parent and the venture subsystem (relational/interface HR set). The relational set is detrimental at the system level, but actually has a positive performance impact at the venture subsystem level. Hierarchical regression results from a sample of 265 China-based IJVs offer support for the above hypotheses developed around the two sets of HR issues.

"This project provides insights into how multitasking impacts consumer decision-making. The effect of multitasking on shopping task performance is investigated across three studies. Authors propose that the effect of multitasking on consumers' shopping task performance (e.g., to purchase low calorie snacks for a get together) is moderated by whether the consumer is in a how (implementation) or why (deliberation) mindset. To the benefit of consumers, results from two lab studies and a field experiment in a retail context suggest that shoppers in how-mindsets can multitask without any negative impact on shopping task performance. However, consumers in a why (deliberation) mindset are negatively affected by multitasking and this effect is mediated by task-induced stress. Results demonstrate that intervention to reduce the stress level eliminates the negative impact of multitasking on consumers in why-mindsets. Taken together, the results suggest that interventions to channel consumers to an implementation mindset or strategies to alleviate the stress levels can help consumers avoid negative impact of multitasking on shopping decisions.

"Whereas the determinants of entrepreneurial choice have been thoroughly analyzed in the literature, little is known about the preferred mode of entry into entrepreneurship, such as taking over an existing business or starting a new venture. Using a large international data set, this study reports considerable differences in takeover preferences across 33 countries. Hierarchical (multilevel) regressions are performed to explore individual-level and country-level determinants of the preferred mode of entry. At the individual level, a person's human capital, risk attitude, and inventiveness influence the preference for starting a new venture versus taking over an existing business. At the country level, the culture-inherent level of risk tolerance, the country's level of innovation output, and the administrative difficulty of starting a new business are found to explain the between-country variation in the preferred mode of entry.

"Although network ties are crucial for firm performance, the strategies by which executives actually form ties are relatively unexplored. In this study, we introduce a new construct, tie formation efficiency, and clarify its importance for superior network outcomes. Building on fieldwork in nine Internet security ventures seeking investment ties, we unexpectedly identify two equifinal paths for how executives form ties efficiently. One relies on existing strong direct ties and is only available to privileged firms. The other relies on a second new concept, catalyzing strategies, a means by which executives advantageously shape opportunities and inducements to form ties that is available to many firms. Overall, we add insights to the network and signaling literatures and to the nascent literature on how strategic action, especially by low-power actors such as entrepreneurs, shapes critical network outcomes.","['nan', 'ALLIANCE FORMATION', 'COLLABORATIVE INNOVATION', 'NETWORK POSITIONS', 'STRUCTURAL HOLES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MARKET', 'SYNDICATE', 'INDUSTRY', 'MODEL', 'ORGANIZATIONS']",['performance'],"['network ties', 'firm performance']",0.0,0.0

"We consider the role that gender-stereotyped behaviors play in investors' evaluations of men- and women-owned ventures. Contrary to research suggesting that investors exhibit bias against women, we find that being a woman entrepreneur does not diminish interest by investors. Rather, our findings reveal that investors are biased against the display of feminine-stereotyped behaviors by entrepreneurs, men and women alike. Our study finds that investor decisions are driven in part by observations of gender-stereotyped behaviors and the implicit associations with the entrepreneur's business competency, rather than the entrepreneur's sex.","['women/minority issues', 'start-up', 'new ventures', 'entrepreneurship', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP ADVANCING DEBATE', 'WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS', 'THIN SLICES', 'VENTURE CAPITALISTS', 'BUSINESS OWNERS', 'ROLE CONGRUITY', 'SEX', 'FEMALE', 'LEADERSHIP', 'BEHAVIOR']","['sex', 'behavior']",['women'],0.0,0.0
"Research linking marketing to financial performance has predominantly focused on how marketing assets and actions add value. The authors argue that it is equally important to understand how marketing decisions can reduce firm value. Prior research has indicated that negative events vary greatly in their indirect costs to the firm. On the basis of established theory and in-depth interviews with practitioners, the authors identify a set of factors that can explain the heterogeneity in the magnitude of indirect costs associated with negative marketing-related events. Specifically, they address how the regulatory exposure of deceptive marketing, which carries no direct cost to the firm, affects shareholder value. Using an event study, the analysis shows that incidents of exposed deceptive marketing are associated with significant, negative abnormal returns amounting to a drop of 1%, which translates into a wealth loss of $86 million for the median-sized firm in the sample. In explaining the variation in magnitude of the impact between events, the authors find that, in general, event characteristics are more significant than firm and brand characteristics. When deception is highly egregious or directed at vulnerable populations, firm value is more negatively affected than when the potential to mislead and harm is not readily verifiable. Furthermore, when the cited product has substantial brand market share, the levels of egregiousness and target audience explain substantially more of the variation in event impact than when brand market share is low. The results are robust to alternative stock-portfolio-based measures of abnormal returns, model specification, heteroskedasticity, and examination of risk. The authors' framework and analysis have implications for Wall Street executives, Main Street managers, academic researchers, and public policy makers.","['marketing-finance interface', 'deception', 'pharmaceuticals', 'regulation', 'event study', 'SHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'CAPITAL-MARKETS', 'DRUG', 'INFORMATION', 'ANNOUNCEMENTS', 'EXPENDITURES', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'RELIABILITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'REPUTATION']","['deception', 'event study', 'shareholder value', 'performance']","['financial performance', 'firm value', 'negative events', 'shareholder value', 'event study', 'deception']",0.5,0.75
"Weather is an ever-present force in consumers' daily lives, yet marketing lacks a comprehensive understanding of how and when it affects consumers and businesses. The current research investigates the effect of weather, a ubiquitous environmental cue, on consumers' valuation of products. A large-scale field study and four experiments demonstrate that weather affects product valuation but only under particular conditions. In line with a process account drawing on mental simulation of product use, product valuation increases only if (1) the product is associated (vs. not associated) with a given weather state, as the match of product and weather facilitates mental simulation, and (2) the product is perceived as attractive (vs. unattractive), as mental simulation highlights both positive and negative product characteristics. We test three weather states-sunshine, snowfall, and rain-and find that our effects emerge for sunshine and snowfall but not for rain, as the latter does not enhance mental simulation. The findings advance literature on the effects of environmental cues and mental simulation and guide firms on how to increase consumers' valuation of products by weather-related measures.","['Weather', 'Product valuation', 'Mental simulation', 'Environmental cues', 'Online auctions', 'MENTAL SIMULATION', 'WARM', 'CONSUMPTION', 'SUNSHINE', 'BELIEFS', 'MEMORY', 'MOOD']","['weather', 'product valuation', 'mental simulation', 'environmental cues', 'mental simulation', 'sunshine']","['weather', 'weather', 'mental simulation']",0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
"In this article we draw on goal-setting theory to analyze how and why entrepreneurs perceive the usefulness of policy programs aimed at facilitating the development of academic ventures. Using a conjoint study and data on 3,136 assessments nested within 98 academic entrepreneurs, we find that access to finance offered by a policy program is central and enhances the entrepreneurs' perceived benefits of other policy measures such as providing access to nonfinancial resources (networks, business knowledge) and reducing administrative burdens, but diminishes the perceived benefits of offering tax incentives for new ventures. Our results extend the literature on academic entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs' assessments of government policy measures. For policy makers, our study suggests that the simultaneous launch of policy measures may be perceived by academic entrepreneurs as particularly beneficial for fostering the development of their young ventures.","['nan', 'SPIN-OUT COMPANIES', 'TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'DEVELOPMENT COSTS', 'PUBLIC RESEARCH', 'START-UPS', 'VENTURE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FIRMS', 'RESOURCES']","['venture', 'resources']",['entrepreneurship'],0.0,0.0
"Buy domestic promotions in various countries often urge citizens to help domestic workers whose jobs are threatened by imports. To explain why purchasers might engage in buy domestic purchase activities, the authors develop and test a model that features six explanatory constructs drawn from previous behavioral research about why people help distressed victims. The authors use multiple-group structural equation analysis of survey data from Portugal and the United States to test the model. The results strongly support the model and are quite consistent for both nations. in both nations, supportive purchase-related behavior increases as purchasers feel competent to help; believe that the threat from imports is salient; perceive social influences that support helping; hold values that derogate foreigners but support domestic citizens; and, for the United States only, perceive lower personal costs of helping, These findings suggest implications for buy domestic promotions.","['nan', 'HELPING-BEHAVIOR', 'MODEL', 'CONSTRUCTS']","['model', 'constructs']","['domestic promotions', 'domestic workers']",0.0,0.0
"This research proposes a mechanism to develop long-term donor relationships, a major challenge in the nonprofit industry. The authors propose a metric, donation variety, which captures a donor's breadth of donations with a given nonprofit organization, controlling for the distribution of donations to different initiatives. Using donation data spanning 20 years from a major U.S. public university, the authors find that improvements in donation variety increase the likelihood that the donor will make a subsequent donation, increase the donation amount, and reduce the sensitivity of donations to negative macroeconomic shocks. In the acquisition phase, most donors give to a single initiative, and these decisions are more influenced by a donor's intrinsic motivations. In contrast, as the donor-nonprofit organization relationship develops over time, nonprofit marketing efforts have a more significant influence on a donor's decision to give to multiple initiatives. Finally, the authors conduct a field study that validates the econometric analysis and provides causal evidence that marketing efforts by nonprofit organizations can encourage donors to spread donations across multiple initiatives.","['donation variety', 'field study', 'cross-buying', 'donor relationship management', 'DYNAMIC-MODEL', 'CUSTOMER', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'IMPACT', 'PREFERENCES', 'NETWORKS', 'PROVIDER', 'STRATEGY', 'BEHAVIOR']","['donation variety', 'field study']","['donor relationships', 'donation variety', 'intrinsic motivations', 'marketing efforts', 'across multiple initiatives']",0.2,0.5
"Recent research shows that forecasting ability is an organizational distinctive competence. We propose and test a model accounting for interfirm differences in forecasting ability. After controlling for reciprocal effects, we find that two principal firm-level factors (i.e., organizational illusion of control and organizational attention) influence both bias and magnitude of errors in estimates. High organizational illusion of control increases positive forecast bias. As for organizational attention, higher relative investments in market information appear to reduce positive forecast bias and magnitude of errors; they also moderate forecast bias due to illusion of control. Finally, higher relative investments in employee capability increase both negative forecast bias and, unexpectedly, magnitude of errors for the majority of observed cases.

"Traditional research on corporate governance has viewed the contribution of corporate directors to strategy making as Limited by their lack of independence or firm-specific knowledge. To the degree that directors contribute to strategy, most previous research has viewed their role primarily as dealing with the conflict resulting from divergent preferences of agents and principles. The cognitive perspective this paper proposes suggests that directors contribute to dealing with the complexity and uncertainty associated with strategic decisions. It argues that directors possess valuable problem-solving expertise, which they can apply to a variety of contexts. Directors make their cognitive contributions to strategic decision making by performing along with a firm's managers a set of cognitive tasks: scanning, interpretation and choice.","['nan', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'AGENCY THEORY', 'TOP MANAGERS', 'DIRECTORS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'MODEL', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'INFORMATION']","['decision making', 'directors']",['corporate governance'],0.0,0.0
"The present research investigates the manner in which product form communicates functional performance, and examines how the form of a product can alter judgments about feature function. In a series of experiments, product form is pitted against objective information about feature function to understand how conflicting visual and verbal cues are reconciled. The findings indicate that when a product's form suggests a particular level of functional performance, consumers naturally incorporate that information into judgments of feature performance, even when presented with conflicting feature information from an objective source. The role of consumer attention in the process is also explored. The results suggest that product developers may be able to improve perceived performance by focusing design efforts and marketing communications on specific features that visually communicate functionality.","['nan', 'DESIGN', 'INFERENCES', 'DISTORTION', 'QUALITY', 'BEAUTY', 'FACES']",['design'],['attention'],0.0,0.0
"A comprehensive model of political behavior and its influence on career growth was presented and tested via a Chinese sample of 283 employee-supervisor dyads. Need for achievement and need for power were found to be positively related to political behavior, and perceptions of organizational politics strengthened the relationship between these personal needs and political behavior. Furthermore, for individuals high in political skill, increases in political behavior were associated with greater career growth potential rated by supervisors, whereas for individuals low in political skill, increases in political behavior were associated with lower ratings of career growth potential.

"This paper advances understanding of corporate governance relationships with a longitudinal study of multiple antitakeover options. Prior analyses have been primarily cross-sectional, focused exclusively on a single provision ignoring provisions which require subsequent stockholder approval. The current study uses agency theory, and broadens this perspective by examining the differential impact of institutional investors' stockholding, managerial stock ownership, and corporate board characteristics on the rate of adoption of six provisions, including provisions which do and do not require stockholder approval. Results of hazard analyses of the rate of amendment adoption of 185 firms between 1984 and 1988 indicate that the impact of governance variables on antitakeover provisions differ depending on whether these actions require stockholder approval or not. The pattern of differences indicates that institutional investors use their voting power when they are given an opportunity to vote and that substitution between direct shareholder control and managerial stock ownership exists.","['antitakeover provisions', 'agency theory', 'boards of directors', 'governance mechanisms', 'POISON PILL SECURITIES', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'CHARTER AMENDMENTS', 'STOCKHOLDER WEALTH', 'GOLDEN PARACHUTES', 'BOARD COMPOSITION', 'LARGE SHAREHOLDERS', 'VOTING-RIGHTS', 'AGENCY THEORY', 'STOCK-PRICES']","['antitakeover provisions', 'agency theory', 'agency theory']","['corporate governance', 'firms']",0.0,0.0
"Purpose This paper aims to strive to close the current research gap pertaining to potential implications of the blockchain for supply chain management (SCM) by presenting a framework built on four established economic theories, namely, principal agent theory (PAT), transaction cost analysis (TCA), resource-based view (RBV) and network theory (NT). These theories can be used to derive research questions that are theory-based as well as relevant for the industry. This paper is intended to initiate and stimulate an academic discussion on the potential impact of the blockchain and introduces a framework for middle-range theorizing together with several research questions. Design/methodology/approach This paper builds on previous theories that are frequently used in SCM research and shows how they can be adapted to blockchain-related questions. Findings This paper introduces a framework for middle-range theorizing together with several research questions. Research limitations/implications The paper presents blockchain-related research questions derived from four frequently used theories, namely, PAT, TCA, RBV and (NT). These questions will guide future research pertaining to structural (PAT, TCA) and managerial issues (RBV, NT) and will foster middle-range theory development in SCM research. Practical implications Blockchain technology has the potential to significantly change SCM. Given the huge investments by industry, academic research is needed which investigates potential implications and supports companies. In this paper, various research questions are introduced that illustrate how the implications of blockchain on SCM can be investigated from different perspectives. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, no academic papers are published in leading academic journals that investigate the relationship between SCM and blockchain from a theory-based perspective.","['Information systems', 'Business strategy', 'Disruption', 'Value chain', 'Global value chain', 'Management strategy', 'Blockchain', 'Middle-range theorizing', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'TRANSACTION COST ECONOMICS', 'AGENCY THEORY', 'THEORETICAL FOUNDATION', 'COMPLEMENTARY THEORIES', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'THEORY PERSPECTIVE', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'MIDDLE-RANGE', 'MANAGEMENT']","['blockchain', 'middle range theorizing', 'resource based view', 'middle range', 'management']","['supply chain management', 'resource based view', 'technology']",0.3333333333333333,0.2
"A firm's ability to acquire and exploit external knowledge is often critical to achieving and sustaining a competitive advantage. In this study, we adopt a multi-dimensional view of absorptive capacity and focus specifically on the application of external knowledge that has been obtained via university-firm collaborations. We examine various organizational conditions that we propose influence a firm's ability to apply external knowledge for explorative and exploitative innovations. We collected data by a survey of firms in industries that frequently work with university research centres (URCs) and from publicly available sources. Results show that predictors of exploration and exploitation of the application of external knowledge differ. Surprisingly, technological relatedness, a common measure of absorptive capacity, is negatively associated with the application of external knowledge to explorative innovations, indicating that knowledge from more distant sources is applied more to exploration. Results also indicate that the effects of two external learning capabilities (prior experience with URCs and technological capability) on knowledge application are moderated in such a way by the tacitness of the knowledge transferred that experience is a stronger predictor when the knowledge is more explicit and technological capability is a stronger predictor when the knowledge is more tacit. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on the application of external knowledge.","['nan', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'INNOVATION', 'MODEL', 'FIRM', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'NETWORKS', 'COLLABORATION', 'CAPABILITIES']","['absorptive capacity', 'innovation', 'firm', 'collaboration', 'capabilities']","['exploration', 'learning capabilities', 'experience']",0.0,0.0
"Consumer research largely examines television advertising effects using conventional psychological accounts of message processing. Consequently, there is an emphasis on the influence of textual content at the expense of the everyday interpersonal viewing contexts surrounding advertising audiences. To help restore this theoretical imbalance an ethnographic study was conducted in eight Australian homes to explore the influence of everyday viewing contexts on advertising audiences. This article examines how the everyday advertising contexts of social interaction, viewing space, media technology use, and time impact consumer responses to television advertising texts. Advertising viewing behavior in the family living room is framed within broader household activity and around cultural ideas regarding family life, and can enhance consumer and family identity value. Our theoretical framework details how television advertisements, everyday viewing contexts, household discourse, and viewer practices intersect to produce processes of advertising response and engagement not explicated in previous studies of consumer behavior.","['nan', 'MEDIA MULTITASKING', 'TELEVISION', 'MATERIALISM', 'CONSUMPTION', 'EXPOSURE', 'CHILDREN', 'IDENTITY', 'TIME']","['television', 'identity', 'time']",['television advertising'],0.0,0.0

"As a living association of scholars from across the globe, the Academy of Management changes over time. My experience supports this, given that the Academy is quite different today than it was in 1976 when I attended my first annual meeting. Herein I argue that the challenges the Academy is now facing challenges that will bring about additional change arise primarily from increasing expectations of us as scholars as we complete our work, the increased scrutiny from stakeholders that affects our work, and a set of external realities (e.g., declining revenue streams from sources that historically have supported academic institutions and reputational contests through which universities seek to be seen positively relative to their peers) and conditions within academic institutions (e.g., changing compositions of management faculties). I offer a value proposition that might serve as a foundation for determining actions the Academy can take to deal with the constant challenge of a changing world. While the proposed proposition (Supporting Scholars, Producing Scholarship) requires thorough analysis, it may be able to serve as a starting point for productive discussions among Academy members. These discussions are appropriate in that, as members, we are the Academy of Management, and we have the opportunity and responsibility to shape its future.","['nan', 'PRESIDENTIAL-ADDRESS', 'MANAGEMENT EDUCATION', 'QUEST', 'SCHOLARSHIP']",['scholarship'],"['reputational', 'universities']",0.0,0.0
"Edith Penrose's (1959) book, The Theory of the Growth of the Firm, is considered by many, scholars in the strategy field to be the seminal work that provided the intellectual foundations for the modem, resource-based theory of the firm. However, the present paper suggests that Penrose's direct or intended contribution to resource-based thinking has been misinterpreted. Penrose never aimed to provide useful strategy prescriptions for managers to create a sustainable stream of rents; rather, she tried to rigorously describe the processes through which firms grow. In her theory, rents were generally assumed not to occur. If they arose this reflected an inefficient macro-level outcome of an otherwise efficient micro-level growth process. Nevertheless, her ideas have undoubtedly stimulated 'good conversation' within the strategy field in the spirit of Mahoney and Pandian (1992); their emerging use by some scholars as building blocks in models that show how sustainable competitive advantage and rents can be achieved is undeniable, although such use was never intended by Edith Penrose herself Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.","['Penrose', 'resource-based view', 'multinationals', 'rents', 'SUSTAINED COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISES', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'USEFUL PERSPECTIVE', 'PUBLIC-POLICY', 'FIRM', 'INVESTMENT', 'FRAMEWORK']","['penrose', 'rents', 'firm']","['strategy field', 'rents', 'competitive advantage']",0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333

"Combining primary survey data collected from a probability sample of U.S. advertising agencies and semi-structured interviews with advertising practitioners, I tested a novel link from class background to creative employment through a cultural process of matching people to jobs. Qualitative data show that shared culture, specifically omnivorous-diverse and inclusive-taste and socialization, signals creative potential to employers and motivates people to pursue creative positions. Structural equation modeling reveals that omnivorous socialization and taste mediate the relationship between class background and creative employment: when middle-class parents expose their children to diverse leisure activities, this exposure has a positive indirect effect on creative employment. It may not actually make those children more creative, but such exposure makes them more likely to enter fields in which they will be viewed as creative. The findings highlight a new direction for research on creativity, contribute to the debate on the role of cultural capital in occupational attainment, and extend knowledge on the early origins of career choice.","['Creative employment', 'cultural capital', 'occupational attainment', 'labor markets', 'cultural omnivores', 'hiring', 'career choice', 'social class', 'EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT', 'SOCIAL NETWORKS', 'WORK', 'TASTE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MEDIATION', 'ORGANIZATION', 'TRAJECTORIES', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'EXPERIENCES']","['creative employment', 'cultural capital', 'occupational attainment', 'career choice', 'taste']","['culture', 'taste', 'socialization', 'structural equation modeling']",0.25,0.2
"Family-supportive supervision benefits employees in many ways. But what are the implications for the supervisors themselves, particularly when this support is not extended? Drawing on social exchange theory, we frame family-supportive supervision as a desirable resource that when withheld may trigger negative social responses from employees. We hypothesize that workplace ostracism is a mechanism through which employees sanction supervisors who fail to be family-supportive, thereby harming supervisor well-being. Study 1 captured the employee perspective and utilized an experimental design to understand whether employees engage in ostracism in response to a lack of family-supportive supervision. In Study 2, we captured the supervisor perspective with multisource data to examine whether supervisors report ostracism and in turn lower subjective well-being when employees report a lack of family-supportive supervision. Consistent findings were observed across studies, suggesting negative outcomes for supervisors who fail to be family-supportive. In Study 2, we also examined moderators of the relationship between failing to be family-supportive and workplace ostracism and potential conditional indirect effects. However, we did not find evidence of such effects.

"Prior research has suggested that many consumers prefer domestic to foreign products, even when the quality is lower and the price is higher. Such bias is attributed to consumer ethnocentrism. This study critically examines the current conceptualizations of consumer ethnocentrism and proposes an extension of its conceptual boundaries and measurement. It determines that consumer ethnocentrism is a multidimensional construct that encompasses five dimensions: prosociality, cognition, insecurity, reflexiveness, and habituation. Empirical evidence from the United Kingdom and the United States demonstrates that the extended measurement instrument better predicts consumers' preferences for local brands at the expense of foreign brands.","['consumer ethnocentrism', 'dimensions', 'conceptualization', 'measurement', 'COUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN', 'NATIONAL IDENTITY', 'ANIMOSITY MODEL', 'BRAND ORIGIN', 'FOREIGN', 'ATTITUDES', 'PRODUCTS', 'STEREOTYPES', 'BIAS', 'IDENTIFICATION']","['consumer ethnocentrism', 'dimensions', 'conceptualization', 'measurement', 'foreign', 'products', 'bias']",['consumer ethnocentrism'],1.0,0.14285714285714285
"Traditional customer satisfaction research considers satisfaction judgments invariant to temporal distance. We conduct two experiments and a field study to show that the amount of time elapsed between a service consumption experience and its evaluation influences satisfaction judgments. We show that consumers rely on concrete attributes to represent near-past (NP) experiences and on abstract attributes to represent distant-past (DP) experiences (i.e., different construal levels). The findings indicate that construal mechanisms generate intertemporal shifts in the importance of the attributes driving satisfaction over time (Study 1), in the weights assigned to abstract and concrete attributes of a past service experience (Study 2), and in overall satisfaction judgments when abstract and concrete attributes perform differently (Study 3). Overall, the results provide support for the idea that satisfaction judgments shift over time as a result of the different psychological mechanisms that are activated as a function of the time elapsing between the service experience and its evaluation. Managers are advised to adopt longitudinal approaches to customer satisfaction measurement: An immediate assessment to capture customers' evaluations of the performance of the concrete details of the experience and a delayed assessment to measure customer satisfaction with more abstract and goal-related features of the experience.","['customer satisfaction', 'construal-level theory', 'temporal distance', 'services', 'experimental design', 'ATTRIBUTE-LEVEL PERFORMANCE', 'TIME', 'EXPERIENCE', 'VALUATION', 'RESPONSES', 'DISTANCE', 'EVALUATE', 'ONLINE', 'MODEL']","['customer satisfaction', 'temporal distance', 'time', 'experience', 'valuation', 'distance']","['satisfaction', 'distance', 'consumption', 'concrete attributes', 'construal levels']",0.2,0.16666666666666666
"Our paper elaborates the effects of resource relatedness on value of a multibusiness firm. We emphasize that value results from interplay of benefits of synergy and redeployability. This view, considering how synergy and redeployability interact in determining value, extends prior separate considerations of the two benefits. We also diagnose that the value effect of resource relatedness is contingent on uncertainty and specify this contingent relationship. We use the real option valuation approach and formally evaluate the impacts of the two effects of relatedness. This explication enables us to demonstrate how redeployability contributes to value beyond synergy, and how they contribute in tandem. In this sense, we illuminate previously undiagnosed value in multibusiness firms. Beyond theoretical implications, our results have important empirical and managerial implications.

"To learn more about the role of line managers in the implementation of HR practices, we propose and test a model of line managers' perceptions of enabling HR practices on the one hand and employee outcomes on the other. In a field study of 89 line managers and 631 employees, we observed that the relationship between line managers' perceptions of enabling HR practices and employees' intrinsic motivation, affective organizational commitment, and turnover intention was mediated by employees' perceived supervisor support. Line managers' perceptions of enabling HR practices, in turn, were predicted by line managers' perceived quality of the HR training they received. Theoretical and practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.","['affective commitment', 'HR implementation', 'intrinsic motivation', 'line managers', 'perceived supervisor support', 'turnover intention', 'PERCEIVED SUPERVISOR SUPPORT', 'HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT', 'LEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'PERFORMANCE-APPRAISAL', 'INTRINSIC MOTIVATION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT', 'MIDDLE-MANAGERS', 'NORMATIVE COMMITMENT', 'SELF-DETERMINATION', 'WORK']","['intrinsic motivation', 'line managers', 'perceived supervisor support', 'turnover intention', 'perceived supervisor support', 'intrinsic motivation']","['intrinsic motivation', 'commitment', 'turnover']",0.3333333333333333,0.16666666666666666
"In industries that produce high-technology products or are reliant on technology for administrative or manufacturing processes, it is essential appropriately to link technologies to markets in order to increase shareholder value and to build future cash flows. Research and development (R&D) allocations in such industries are greatly dependent on forecasts of the R&D project's estimated potential contribution to future cash flows, which is related to the project's ability to satisfy current or future customer needs. The resource allocation decisions are difficult, however, since both markets and technology are likely to be highly uncertain. Although the innovation literature ably has addressed specific relationships between certain factors and new product development outcomes, less attention has been given to obstacles faced in linking technology to markets. Grounded in a literature-based discussion of technology and market opportunity, the authors develop a conceptual framework for identifying and understanding the barriers facing managers in the process of matching technologies to market opportunities. Technology and market barriers include technology-market linkage, technology availability, technology and market capabilities of competitors, and business model feasibility. Strategy and structure barriers include competition for limited resources, technology capabilities, technology portfolio goals, current market strategies, and competition for control of market charters. Social and cultural barriers include interpretive and communication barriers between functional units and language and cultural barriers within the technology workforce. The article concludes with implications for researchers and managers. The conceptual framework presented here can encourage the development of a stream of research in the area of technology strategy and planning processes, allowing researchers to improve our understanding of the process of technology innovation. Managers can use the framework as a guide for addressing a wide range of issues related to the process of matching technologies to market opportunities. For example, rather than relying strictly on cash flow projections for estimating the value of a new technology, managers also should consider how the technology could create new market opportunities or could reshape existing ones.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT INNOVATION', 'PROJECT PERFORMANCE', 'DEVELOPMENT TEAMS', 'SHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'STRATEGY', 'CAPABILITIES', 'CHAMPIONS', 'FRAMEWORK', 'ORGANIZATION']","['research and development', 'shareholder value', 'strategy', 'capabilities', 'framework']","['innovation', 'product development']",0.0,0.0
"Despite the consensus on the negative country-level implications of corruption, its consequences for firms are less understood. This study examines the effect of bribery on the innovative performance of firms in emerging markets as reflected by new product introductions. I argue that bribery may help innovators in these markets to introduce new products by overcoming bureaucratic obstacles, compensating for the lack of kinship or political affiliations, and hedging against political risk. I also propose that the relationship between firm bribery and new product introduction will be negatively moderated (i.e., weakened) by the quality of the formal and informal institutions in place. Employing data from over 6,000 firms in 30 emerging markets and a wide range of empirical tests, my results support these hypotheses. These findings extend transaction costs economics by showing that bureaucratic obstacles and uncertainty can drive firms into illegal cost minimization strategies. Moreover, they augment institutional theory by expounding upon the ways that norms and informal practices moderate the efficiency of firm strategies in emerging markets.","['corruption', 'innovation', 'institutions', 'new products', 'emerging economies', 'NATIONAL INNOVATION', 'PAY BRIBES', 'CORRUPTION', 'FIRM', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CAPABILITY', 'STRATEGY', 'ENTRY', 'TRUST', 'TIME']","['corruption', 'institutions', 'new products', 'corruption', 'firm', 'performance']","['corruption', 'transaction costs']",0.5,0.16666666666666666
"Multinational enterprises (MNEs) play a pivotal role in the development of many emerging economies. In consequence, they became the focus of scholarly research by economists and policy analysts. In contrast, international business scholars have been comparatively uninterested in analysing this role of MNEs. Yet they could make important contributions to these debates. First, studies taking the individual firms as starting point would enhance understanding of the interaction between MNEs and the local environment. Second, theories and research methodologies developed in international business research could provide new insights into the dynamics of MNEs in emerging economies. The objective of this paper is to motivate more international business scholars to engage in research on positive and negative spillovers from foreign direct investment (FDI) in emerging economy societies. To advance this research agenda, scholars need to analyse the specific activities and capabilities of the firms involved, and the impact of FDI on the broader social and environmental context. For management, this agenda raises the ethical question: To what extent ought businesses to care about their local stakeholders?","['multinational enterprises', 'emerging economies', 'business in society', 'FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL TRANSFORMATION', 'PRODUCTIVITY SPILLOVERS', 'INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'LABOR STANDARDS', 'DOMESTIC FIRMS', 'PANEL-DATA']","['multinational enterprises', 'emerging economies', 'foreign direct investment', 'international business']","['multinational', 'emerging economies', 'foreign direct investment']",0.6666666666666666,0.5
"B v identifying the possibility that technologies with inferior performance can displace established incumbents, the notion of disruptive technologies, pioneered by Christensen (1997), has had a profound effet on the way in which scholars and managers approach technology competition. While the phenomenon of disruptive technologies has been well documented, the underlying theoretical drivers of technology disruption are less well understood. This article identifies the demand conditions that enable disruptive dynamics. By examining how consumers evaluate technology, and how this evaluation changes as performance improves, it offers new theoretical insight into the impact of the structure of the demand environment on competitive dynamics. Two new constructs-preference overlap and preference symmetry-are introduced to characterize the relationships among the preferences of different market segments. The article presents a,formal model that examines how these relationships lead to the emergence of different competitive regimes. The model is analyzed using computer simulation. The theory and model results hold implications for understanding the dynamics of disruptive technologies and suggest new indicators for assessing disruptive threats.

"Companies with international linkages often find if necessary to use expatriates for a variety of reasons, and the success of these expatriates is frequently critical to the success of the project on which they are working. Many of these companies could potentially benefit from including the spouse in the expatriation process. For example, about 15% of expatriate candidates were reported to have rejected a foreign assignment because of their spouse's career, and this is expected to be a growing reason for rejection, especially in North America and Western Europe. This may also be true in other parts of the world because of an increasing number of working women, and women with careers, in all parts of the world. Substantial research has indicated that spouses are particularly important to the success of the expatriate process, but, surprisingly, there is little research that looks at the expatriate process from the spouse's viewpoint. This is especially true for spouses with a career and with male spouses; little is known of their situation and concerns. This paper draws on a ser-ies of research projects that do address the spouse's viewpoint to suggest practical means by which companies can improve the expatriation process by including the spouse.","['nan', 'UNITED-STATES', 'ADJUSTMENT', 'SELECTION', 'SUCCESS']",['success'],"['working women', 'women']",0.0,0.0
"More and more resources are becoming available on the Web, and there is a growing need for infrastructures that, based on advertised descriptions, can match demands with supplies in an electronic marketplace. Several matchmakers rely on simple keyword matching, but significant matching results can only be obtained by exploiting the semantics inherent in structured descriptions. To this end, a novel knowledge representation, approach is proposed, based on description logics, that is superior to both keyword- and basic subsumption-based matchmaking. The properties a matchmaker should have am formalized, and a matchmaking facilitator, compliant with the desired properties, is presented. The system embeds a NeoClassic reasoner whose structural subsumption algorithm has been modified to allow match categorization into potential and partial, and ranking of matches within categories.

"In this paper we argue that unobservable constructs lie at the core of a number of influential theories used in the strategic management literature-including agency theory, transaction cost theory, and the resource-based view of the firm. The debate over how best to deal with the problem of unobservables has raged in the philosophy of science literature for the best parr of the current century. On the one hand there are the positivists, who believe that theories containing unobservable constructs are only useful as tools for making predictions. According to positivists, such theories do not inform us about the deep structure of reality. On the other hand, there are the realists, who believe that our theories can give us knowledge about unobservables. Herein we review this debate, we argue for adopting a realist position, and we draw out the implications for strategic management research.","['PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE', 'RESEARCH METHODOLOGY', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'GAME-THEORY', 'FIRM', 'INDUSTRY']","['philosophy of science', 'resource based view', 'firm']","['constructs', 'resource based view']",0.5,0.3333333333333333

"Leader-member exchange (LMX) theory proposes that leaders develop different quality relationships with those they manage and this is predictive of work performance. While LMX quality has been viewed as univalent (ranging from low to high quality), this paper proposes that it can also be bivalent in nature (i.e., coexisting positive and negative thoughts towards the relationship), which we refer to as LMX ambivalence. A survey measure of LMX ambivalence is developed, and through three validation and two main studies, it is shown to have construct, discriminant, and incremental predictive validity beyond that of LMX quality. Hypotheses concerning LMX ambivalence and task performance are tested in two main studies and show that (1) LMX ambivalence is negatively related to performance regardless of LMX quality, (2) high levels of perceived support from the organization (Study 1) or coworkers (Study 2) nullify the negative association between LMX ambivalence and performance, and (3) high LMX ambivalence leads to more negative affect and in turn lower task performance, but only when coworker support is low (Study 2). These results show the importance of viewing LMX quality not only in terms of its absolute level (low vs. high quality) but also as a bivalent construct where both positive and negative cognitions can coexist. They also demonstrate the value of social support in buffering the negative effects of LMX ambivalence. Furthermore, our findings extend a central tenet of LMX theory by implying that LMX quality varies not only within groups (i.e., LMX differentiation) but also within leader-follower dyads.","['leader-member exchange', 'LMX', 'ambivalence', 'performance', 'negative affect', 'workplace relationships', 'social support', 'variability', 'PERCEIVED ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'NEGATIVE AFFECT', 'ATTITUDINAL AMBIVALENCE', 'ABUSIVE SUPERVISION', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'RELATIONSHIP QUALITY', 'MODERATED MEDIATION', 'CUSTOMER SERVICE', 'MODEL']","['leader member exchange', 'lmx', 'ambivalence', 'performance', 'negative affect', 'social support', 'negative affect']","['work performance', 'ambivalence']",0.5,0.14285714285714285

"Many online retailers make sales and stock level information live available to customers on their websites and offline retailers also increasingly can display this information. Yet it is unclear how consumers perceive such information and how it influences consumer choice. High sales and low stock may both signal popularity and quality, which will stimulate further sales. We however argue that sales level is more diagnostic than stock level as a cue and hence the effect of sales level on consumer choice will be stronger than that of stock level. Also, when both cues are available, the effect of sales level is expected to dominate. In addition, brand familiarity is expected to moderate these effects. These hypotheses are tested in two scenario-based online experiments in which participants choose between competing products for which information about either sales levels, stock levels, or both sales and stock levels is displayed. Results support the hypotheses and also show that sales level is indeed a more diagnostic cue than stock level. Analyses further reveal how perceptions of the popularity and quality of a product mediate the effects of sales and stock levels on consumer choice. The findings imply that retailers can successfully use sales and stock level information to induce quality perceptions and influence consumer choices. (C) 2017 New York University.

"Relative to the volume of research into internationalization, inward operations have received much less attention than outward operations. This study addresses this imbalance by focusing on the degree to which firms import, how imports started relative to exports, and what import-related factors affect exporting. Findings from a survey of Finnish SMEs suggest that responding firms rate management interest, limited domestic market, and inquiries from buyers as the most significant incentives to start exporting. Import- experienced exporters assign higher ratings on nearly all export incentives, while pure-exporters consider themselves more dependent on governmental support. Importing per se has a comparatively modest, yet statistically signifi cant, influence on exporting.","['exporting', 'Finland', 'importing', 'importing-exporting', 'internationalization', 'inward', 'inward-outward', 'outward', 'SME', 'BUSINESS NETWORKS', 'FIRMS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'VENTURES']","['exporting', 'importing', 'internationalization', 'inward', 'outward', 'sme', 'firms']","['internationalization', 'firms', 'smes']",0.6666666666666666,0.2857142857142857
"This paper explains how research and development (R&D) collaborations impact process innovation; given the differences in innovation mechanisms, prior insights from studies of product innovation do not necessarily apply to process innovation. Extending the knowledge-based view of the firm, this paper classifies four types of R&D collaborationswith universities, suppliers, competitors, and customersin terms of two knowledge dimensions: position in the knowledge chain and contextual knowledge distance. Position in the knowledge chain is the position of the R&D collaboration partner in the knowledge chain of the industrythe input-output sequence of activities that result in the transformation of raw materials into products that are used by end customers. Based on this knowledge chain, this paper considers universities and suppliers as upstream R&D collaborators, and competitors and customers as downstream R&D collaborators. Contextual knowledge distance is the difference in industry-related contexts of operation of the R&D collaboration partners and the firm. Based on this, this paper views R&D collaborators that are suppliers and competitors as having low contextual knowledge distance to the firm, and R&D collaborators that are customers and universities as having high contextual knowledge distance to the firm. Using this classification, this paper proposes a ranking of R&D collaborations in terms of their impact on process innovation: R&D collaborations with suppliers have the highest impact, followed by R&D collaborations with universities, then R&D collaborations with competitors, and finally R&D collaborations with customers. These arguments are tested on a four-year panel of 781 manufacturing firms. The results of the analyses indicate that R&D collaborations with suppliers and universities appear to have a positive impact on process innovation, R&D collaborations with customers appear to have no impact, and R&D collaborations with competitors appear to have a negative impact. As a consequence, the main driver of the impact of R&D collaborations on process innovation appears to be position in the knowledge chain rather than contextual knowledge distance. These novel ideas and findings contribute to the literature on process innovation. Even though process innovation tends to be internal and tacit to the firm, it can still benefit from external R&D collaborations; this paper is the first to analyze this relationship and provide a theoretical framework for understanding why this would be the case. This study also has important managerial implications. It suggests that managers need to be careful in choosing the partners for their firms' R&D collaborations. Engaging in R&D collaborations with universities and suppliers appears to be helpful for process innovation, whereas conducting R&D collaborations with competitors may potentially harm process innovation.","['nan', 'DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION', 'SUPPLIER INVOLVEMENT', 'PRODUCT INNOVATION', 'DYNAMIC THEORY', 'FIRM', 'INTEGRATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'INTERFIRM', 'COMPLEMENTARITY', 'ACCUMULATION']","['product innovation', 'firm']",[],0,0.0
"Purpose - There is an acknowledged need to advance the supply chain management (SCM) learning agenda, with an emphasis on integration. This paper discuss an Australian university-industry collaboration aimed at accelerating SCM learning and offers some insight into models for building a forward-looking SCM. Design/methodology/approach - The research is an exploratory case study of the industry-university collaboration, using grounded theory procedures. The primary data involved 25 interviews with key participants from the university and industry partners, and from the first cohort of students in the undergraduate program developed within the collaboration. Findings - A theoretical framework for accelerating SCM learning was developed from the case study data; it comprises six constructs that influence, at strategic and operational levels, the acceleration of SCM learning. Four cross-construct concepts from the framework that form the cornerstones of accelerated learning are discussed in some detail. Research limitations/implications - The framework facilitates an examination of successes and shortfalls in the case study collaboration and generates a deeper understanding of critical elements for progressing the SCM learning agenda, and expanding SCM education. As with all qualitative research, the results may not be generalisable; testing the relevance and usefulness of the framework with the field will be an important next step. Practical implications - As the framework identifies conditions, characteristics and capacities of organisations and individuals that support the acceleration of SCM learning, it can provide assistance in designing future university-industry collaborations for advancing SCM learning. Originality/value - The framework identifies critical success factors for alliances and partnerships aimed at accelerating learning in an emerging body of knowledge such as SCM.","['Australia', 'Supply chain management', 'Learning', 'Education', 'Collaboration', 'LOGISTICS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ALLIANCES', 'FUTURE', 'IMPACT', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'EVOLUTION', 'EVALUATE', 'SYSTEMS', 'SUCCESS']","['australia', 'supply chain management', 'learning', 'education', 'collaboration', 'alliances', 'future', 'success']","['supply chain management', 'australian university', 'accelerated learning', 'education']",0.5,0.25

In addition, it was hypothesized that individual underreward would lead to less cooperative and more selfish behavior. Regression models of performance were run, controlling for prior career performance.

Furthermore, underrewarded individuals behaved less cooperatively and more selfishly, while overrewarded individuals behaved more cooperatively.","['nan', 'PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYERS', 'MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL', 'EQUALITY', 'JUSTICE', 'EQUITY']",['equity'],"['inequity', 'performance']",0.0,0.0
"This article explores the important role of liking in the development of the buyer's trust in the sales rep. The authors argue that liking's role is richer and qualitatively different from that of the more cognitive antecedents of trust. They posit that many cognitive antecedents of trust operate mainly through liking. They argue that as the buyer-sales rep relationship matures, liking plays an even more important role in influencing trust. The authors empirically testa model delineating the mediating role of liking in developing trust. They find that when the relationship between the buyer and the sales rep is young, liking partially mediates the effect of similarity of business values and fully mediates the influence of frequency of personal interaction on trust. Moreover as the buyer's relationship with the rep ages, liking takes the foreground in trust development, while more cognitive antecedents recede into the background.","['nan', 'COOPERATION', 'COMMITMENT', 'MODEL']",['model'],"['liking', 'buyer s trust']",0.0,0.0
"A considerable amount of literature deals with the influence of institutions on entrepreneurship. But for all that, little is known about the interplay between institutions and personal determinants of entrepreneurship. In this paper, the empirical evidence that older people in transition economies have low engagement in entrepreneurial activity is the starting point for analyzing how institutions moderate the relationship between individual characteristics and entrepreneurial choice. The results show that the socioeconomic heritage of being exposed to socialism deters entrepreneurship, an effect that is more pronounced for (high)-impact entrepreneurship. Detailed analyses reveal that the effect is driven by devaluation of socialist work experience and the influence of socialism on mindset. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"This paper demonstrates that prospect theory's (PT) predictions differ dramatically from what strategy scholars have inferred. PT's value function predicts negative risk-return associations for high performers and positive for low performers, directly contrary to the strategy literature. In addition, PT's isolation assumption means most firm choices should appear as mixed gambles. Prior PT-based theorizing in strategy implicitly assumed that the firm faced unmixed gambles. Finally, it demonstrates that PT does not make the general predictions most strategy researchers have assumed, but rather PT's predictions depend on a full range of parametric and choice characteristics that strategy scholars have ignored.

"Dispositional positive affect (DPA) - the stable tendency to experience positive moods and emotions - has been found to be related to several beneficial outcomes (e.g., enhanced career success, development of high quality social relationships, improved personal health). Evidence on this issue is not entirely consistent, however, and high levels of dispositional positive affect have sometimes been found to also be associated with detrimental outcomes (e.g., reduced task performance, biased recall of information, increased impulsivity). A framework is proposed for integrating these seemingly inconsistent findings and applying the result to entrepreneurs. Briefly, this model suggests that there are discrete limits to the benefits conferred by DPA because at very high levels, processes that interfere with specific aspects of cognition, perception, motivation, and self-regulation, operate. The overall result is a curvilinear relationship between entrepreneurs' level of DPA and their performance of tasks closely related to new venture development and growth (e.g., opportunity recognition and evaluation, effective decision making). Factors that make entrepreneurs especially susceptible to negative effects of high levels of DPA are described, and theoretical and practical implications of the proposed model are discussed.

"Empowerment has become a widely used management term in the last decade or so, though, in practical terms, it shares the ambiguity of its predecessors in the HRM tradition. This paper sets out to unravel the web of meaning surrounding empowerment to show what a contested concept it is, and hence why its application in organizational settings is fraught with misunderstanding and tension. It does so by taking an approach that contributes to the examination of HRM discourse and management rhetoric. To demonstrate the ambiguity of empowerment as a concept, the paper reviews the various ways in which the term has been used across non-management disciplines (women, minority groups, education, community care, politics), culminating with a review of the use of empowerment in contemporary management theory. The paper concludes that organizations and managers have chosen to coin a phrase which is open to different, sometimes contradictory, meanings and which, when applied, evokes both subjective attitudes and objective behaviour, means different things in varying contexts, and is affected fundamentally by individual differences in perception and experience. Unless organizations offer clear operational definitions when using empowerment, instead of purely acquiescing to a vague and seductive version of the concept, they are abdicating responsibility for the unpredictable consequences that result.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'CULTURE', 'VALUES']",['organizations'],[],0,0.0

"The authors extend the conceptual work of Anderson and Oliver (1987) and Jaworski (1988) on control in three ways. First, they account for the independent effects of the reinforcement dimension of control, in addition to the information dimension traditionally studied. Second, to reflect the varied behaviors that supervisors attempt to control, they disaggregate behavior control into activity control and capability control. Third, they delineate the direct and mediated effects of control on salespeople. Their proposed framework was tested with data collected from 270 salespeople in five industrial product divisions of two Fortune 500 companies. The findings suggest that managers must carefully match controls-in-use with desired results. Overall, the results show that information and reinforcement effects vary, which suggests the need to distinguish between the information provided and the actual reinforcements administered to salespeople.

"Visual appeal is an important consideration in the design of interior service environments because attractiveness influences consumer behavior. Employing both an experiment and a field study, we show that visual complexity reduces a service environment's attractiveness. Furthermore, we find that the complexity-attractiveness relationship is mediated by processing fluency and its instantaneous affective companion, pleasure. Our findings provide novel insights into the underlying process mechanism involved in channeling the effect of visual complexity on attractiveness. Furthermore, both studies confirm that customers' field dependence moderates the complexity-fluency relationship and that shopping motivation (i.e., hedonic vs. utilitarian shopping goals) moderates the fluency-pleasure relationship. Our findings suggest that it is generally better to reduce the complexity of interior service environments. To achieve this, service firms should reduce the number of objects in the environment, enhance the visual organization and symmetry of their arrangement, and use fewer colors, textures, and materials.","['interior design', 'complexity', 'affect', 'processing fluency', 'field dependence', 'shopping motivation', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'PERCEPTUAL FLUENCY', 'DESIGN', 'PREFERENCE', 'AROUSAL', 'MALL', 'SATISFACTION', 'ARCHITECTURE', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'CONGRUENCY']","['complexity', 'affect', 'processing fluency', 'field dependence', 'shopping motivation', 'design']","['visual appeal', 'service environments', 'visual complexity', 'processing fluency', 'shopping']",0.2,0.16666666666666666

"This research investigates how consumers respond to food-related temptations as a function of recalling their own behavior when faced with a similar temptation in the recent past. Bringing together different streams of relevant research, we propose and find that chronically nonimpulsive individuals display behavioral consistency over time-resisting (succumbing) when they recall having resisted (succumbed) earlier. In contrast, impulsive individuals show a switching pattern, resisting current temptations if they recall having succumbed, and vice versa. These propositions are supported by convergent results across four experiments involving real eating behaviors, response latencies, and hypothetical choices.

"The literature suggests that established firms need to balance their exploration and exploitation activities in order to achieve superior performance. Yet, previous empirical research has modeled this balance as the interaction of orthogonal activities. In this study, we show that there is a trade-off between exploration and exploitation and that the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation depends upon environmental conditions. Using a novel methodology to measure the relative exploration versus exploitation orientation, we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between the relative share of explorative orientation and financial performance. This relationship is positively, moderated by the R&D intensity of the industry in which the firm operates.

"The strategic group concept provides an attractive middle ground between firm and industry for both theory development and empirical analysis. To date, this concept has been defined by researchers in terms of secondary accounting and financial data, and a number of critics have questioned the validity of this work. Our research shows that industry participants share perceptions about strategic commonalities among firms, and that participants cluster competitors in subtle ways not reflected in extant academic research on strategic groups.

They are of research interest as an additional source of data on firm commonalities which helps address concerns about previous strategic group research.","['STRATEGIC GROUPS', 'MANAGERIAL COGNITION', 'COGNITIVE MAPS', 'INDUSTRY EVOLUTION', 'REPERTORY GRID TECHNIQUE', 'MOBILITY BARRIERS', 'GROUP MEMBERS', 'GENERIC STRATEGIES', 'BREWING INDUSTRY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LINKAGE', 'MODELS']","['strategic groups', 'industry evolution']","['strategic commonalities', 'evolution']",0.0,0.0
"Strategic alliance building has proliferated in many industries in recent years. This research focuses on the dynamic aspects of the alliance building process that have been neglected in previous research. The study examines how organizations process information during strategic alliance building and how the effective management of uncertainty and equivocality is linked to alliance success. Analysis of qualitative and quantitative data from a multi-case study leads to a proposed model of information processing in strategic alliance building and research propositions. The research propositions suggest that strategic alliance success is facilitated or impeded by a number of factors including the selection of information-processing mechanisms, the management of alliance building momentum, political activity, and information-processing structure. These factors collectively form information-processing environments that are linked to the success or failure of the alliance. Successful alliance building efforts seem to require adaptive information-processing environments that alter information-processing mechanisms to match information-processing needs.","['nan', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'INTERPRETATION SYSTEMS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN', 'MEDIA RICHNESS', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'HOSPITALS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'PERFORMANCE', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'ISSUES']",['uncertainty'],[],0,0.0

Smith was a system builder; his theory of knowledge underpinned his entire oeuvre, and understanding his systematic approach can help current international business to achieve a similarly coherent body of theory.

"There is a widely held view that the performance affirms depends not only on the ability of managers to exploit economic markets but also on their ability to succeed in political markets. To test the value of political activism, recent scholarship has probed the impact of corporate political activity (CPA) on firm performance. However, mixed findings and the fragmented nature of the field raise more questions than answers as to the nature of this relationship. This systematic review examines scholarly articles for evidence of the impact of CPA on firm value. The findings suggest that CPA is more valuable in emerging countries and that relational CPA strategies are more common in emerging (versus developed) countries where social capital underlies political and economic exchange. We also document the paucity of research on informational CPA strategies and policy outcomes in the emerging country context. We consider the implications of these findings and others for local and multinational enterprises, and offer suggestions for further research. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.

First, we focus on the pay-for-performance sensitivity (PPS), review recent evidence (mainly UK) and outline a methodology for calculating the PPS itself. Secondly, we review the evidence on tournament theory. Tournament models predict that career concerns generate incentives for executives and can explain observed variations in pay outcomes in the boardroom. Thirdly, we provide evidence on the distribution of the PPS for 532 executives within 100 large UK stock market companies for 1997. Unlike prior work, we include non-CEO executives in the analysis. We show that the PPS increases through organizational levels. Also the statistic is not constant across firms. Finally, we consider the relationship between corporate performance and incentives.

Using data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor survey for the UK, this research note explores the characteristics of those self-employed women who operate their businesses from home. Results indicate that a greater proportion of women with poor levels of entrepreneurial resources are more likely to operate home-based businesses, suggesting this decision is shaped by circumstance. The research also finds that such home-based businesses are more likely to operate part time, thus contributing further to their marginality.","['female self-employment', 'home-based', 'home working', 'liquidity constraints', 'SELF-EMPLOYMENT', 'WORK', 'TELEWORKING', 'MEDIA']",['home based'],[],0,0.0
"This study examines how philanthropy can mitigate liability of foreignness (LOF) in the aftermath of a national disaster. A major disaster restructures the social landscape, creating an avenue for corporate contributions to play a role in recovery and relief efforts. This social restructuring offers a valuable opportunity for multinational enterprises (MNEs) to establish strong local ties. In turn, MNE contributions at such times have a stronger impact on their local acceptance. Thus, MNEs can use these events to strengthen their position in the community and mitigate LOF. Using the context of a national disaster in India, I test these arguments with a sample of 190 MNEs and 660 domestic firms. I found that in the aftermath of the disaster, the increase in MNE contributions was much larger and less strongly tied to promotional activities than the increase in contributions from domestic firms, and this difference persisted over time. Moreover, the performance implication of post-disaster philanthropy was stronger for MNEs than for domestic firms. These findings suggest that philanthropy plays a more strategic role for MNEs in the aftermath of a disaster and it has a pronounced effect on mitigating LOF.","['natural disaster', 'philanthropy', 'multinational enterprises', 'social restructuring', 'liability of foreignness', 'India', 'SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'NATIONAL DISASTER', 'GROUP AFFILIATION', 'EMPIRICAL-TEST', 'BUSINESS', 'FIRM', 'IMPACT']","['philanthropy', 'multinational enterprises', 'social restructuring', 'liability of foreignness', 'india', 'national disaster', 'firm', 'impact']","['philanthropy', 'liability of foreignness', 'firms']",0.6666666666666666,0.25
"This paper describes a strategy for actively replicating and updating content for electronic commerce. Active replication and updating of content is achieved by intelligent agents (IA) using a time-invariant fragmentation approach to partitioning and replicating data in a distributed computing environment. Taking into account the time-sensitivity property of data, IAs derive time-invariant fragments for their respective nodes from the query history. A time-invariant fragment (TIF) is that portion of the database whose values do not change during a specified time interval. The algorithm that IAs use in creating TIFs for each node, for a given time interval, is presented. The active replication approach is compared with three other approaches, Full-replication, nonreplication, and materialized view, in terms of data transmission costs. Results indicate that the active approach can be most effective for electronic commerce because of the high percentage of modification queries, the large sire of the network, and the greet number of transactions.","['client-server computing', 'distributed systems', 'electronic commerce', 'intelligent agents', 'DISTRIBUTED DATABASE-SYSTEMS', 'FILE ALLOCATION']","['electronic commerce', 'intelligent agents']","['electronic commerce', 'replication', 'intelligent agents', 'time invariant fragmentation', 'time']",0.4,1.0
"The debate over whether and how thought worlds of different departments (especially marketing and research and development [R&D]) affect managers' decision-making behavior in new product development (NPD) is ongoing. A key challenge of these decisions is to deal with deteriorating NPD projects, which are often subject to escalation of commitment (EoC), with many firms wasting billions of dollars by throwing good money after bad NPD projects. However, understanding departmental thought worlds and their role for EoC in NPD could help firms stop this profusion. Thus, this research provides answers to the question of how thought worlds affect managers' tendency toward EoC in NPD decision-making-both in general and under certain project characteristics. To do so, we conducted four studies based on real-life scenarios with 460 highly experienced NPD managers from marketing and R&D, thus ensuring high validity and reliability. Our research is the first to explore the impact of thought worlds on EoC, thereby detecting that the importance of managers' thought worlds for shaping EoC varies with the NPD project's characteristics. Thus, depending on the specific project situation, different types of managers may be more or less capable of making proper NPD decisions. Moreover, results show that belief updating serves as a respective key mediator. Doing so enriches the theory by showing that managers' thought worlds can substantially influence a major mechanism (i.e., belief updating) of coping with cognitive dissonance. Finally, post hoc tests reveal departmental differences in EoC behavior between marketing and R&D that vary with a project's characteristics. These results imply that firms need to carefully consider who is in charge of making decisions on NPD project continuance in different project situations.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'HIGH-TECHNOLOGY FIRMS', 'CROSS-FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION', 'D-MARKETING INTERFACE', 'RESOURCE-ALLOCATION', 'INTERDEPARTMENTAL INTEGRATION', 'SELECTIVE PERCEPTION', 'RADICAL INNOVATION', 'BELIEF STRUCTURES', 'SUNK COSTS']",['research and development'],"['research and development', 'decision', 'product development', 'firms']",0.25,1.0
"We review the literature that links institutions, entrepreneurship, and economic growth outcomes, focusing in particular on empirical research. Most of the literature has an economics orientation, but we also review relevant literature from other social sciences, including management research. The review helps identify a number of conceptual, theoretical, and empirical gaps, calling for further research. For example, the literature narrowly identifies entrepreneurship with start-ups and self-employment; does not theorize many potentially relevant inter-level links and mechanisms; and suffers from sample limitations, omitted variable biases, causality issues, and response heterogeneity. We argue that theories in management research, such as the resource-based view, transaction cost economics, and strategic entrepreneurship theory, can fill some of the conceptual and theoretical gaps.","['nan', 'SELF-EMPLOYMENT', 'MARKET PROCESS', 'JOB CREATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'DISCOVERY', 'DECISION', 'FREEDOM', 'DETERMINANTS', 'INTEGRATION', 'CORRUPTION']",['self employment'],"['entrepreneurship', 'self employment', 'resource', 'view']",0.25,1.0
"This article links up with recent discussions of the strategy/economics nexus. In contrast to most of the proponents and opponents of economics in strategy thinking, a balanced pluralist perspective is adopted. According to this, a discipline should strike a balance between the generation of new theoretical alternatives and the selection among them. Applying this general idea, I argue that the strategy field is too pluralistic, and that the unfortunate consequences of excessive pluralism and eclecticism may be remedied by economics playing a larger role in the conversation of strategy researchers. This does not necessarily mean standard neoclassical economics or new industrial organization economics; evolutionary economis, for example, is a serious contender, too. The evolution of Michael Porter's thinking is used as a case for demonstrating some of the advantages and some of the dangers of economicsin the strategy field, and for illustrating points about eclecticism and pluralism.","['nan', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'ORGANIZATIONAL ECONOMICS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'FIRM', 'CONVERSATION', 'DECISIONS']",['conversation'],[],0,0.0
"Performance, in the context of organization, is not only a broad concept which has been used synonymously with productivity, efficiency, effectiveness and, more recently competitiveness, it has also been a subject of study for social scientists from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives. More recently, efforts have been made by human resource management (HRM) theorists to try to establish a causal link between HRM and performance. This has led to a growing number of studies which examine the potential contribution that good human resource policy can make to improving organizational performance. This paper is not concerned with the conceptual debate of HRM and performance. Rather, it explores whether adopting good HR practices to improve performance is a practicable approach to organizations in the UK. Drawing on existing empirical evidence from other studies, the paper reviews the strategies British firms deploy to improve labour productivity. In particular, the issue of whether they use the 'high-road' HRM or 'low-road' HRM strategy to enhance performance is investigated. This paper concludes by suggesting that high-road HRM may lead to better organizational performance, but it may not be a strategy that firms opt for, given the historical, social and institutional context of employment relationships in Britain.","['nan', 'WORKPLACE INDUSTRIAL-RELATIONS', 'HIGH COMMITMENT MANAGEMENT', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'UK', 'IMPACT', 'WAGES', 'WORK']","['productivity', 'uk']","['productivity', 'management']",0.5,0.5
"The present research builds theory regarding how use of flexible work practices (FWPs) affects employees' career success.

Managers' perceptions of employees' commitment, in turn, shape employees' career success. Field- and laboratory-based studies provide strong support for the hypothesis that FWP use results in career premiums when managers make productivity attributions and some support for the hypothesis that FWP use results in career penalties when managers make personal life attributions.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'LEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'MONTE-CARLO ANALYSIS', 'FAMILY POLICIES', 'MANAGERIAL PERCEPTIONS', 'IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT', 'EMPLOYEE COMMITMENT', 'ATTRIBUTION THEORY', 'CONFLICT', 'SUCCESS']",['success'],"['work practices', 'organizational commitment']",0.0,0.0

However, this article demonstrates important differences between corporate culture discourse and the Durkheimian concept of morality. Durkheim's views on moral autonomy, his diagnosis of the problematic nature of modern utilitarian values and his insistence on society as the source and the goal of morality are applied as a frame of reference that allows an identification, analysis and discussion of problematic assumptions about man, organization and society in corporate culture discourses.

"This study evaluates the relationship between service performance and customer loyalty intentions in a business-to-business context. Specifically, the third-party logistics industry is used as a contextual setting for the research. A conceptual model is developed based on literature in social exchange theory and business buying behavior. The model suggests that service performance directly influences both social (i.e., trust) and economic (i.e., value) relationship outcomes and that these outcomes positively influence customer loyalty intentions. However, in contrast to existing business-to-consumer research, mediation analysis supports the hypothesis that the relationship between service performance and customer loyalty intention is fully mediated by relationship outcomes. Further analyses indicate that characteristics specific to business customers-organizational relationship norms and industry competitive intensity-have important moderating influences. Collectively, the findings imply that business-to-business service managers should move beyond simply tracking the performance of their services. Customer perceptions of relationship trust and perceived facilitation of economic outcomes also should be measured, since these are more proximal to loyalty outcomes. Further, service managers should leverage customer knowledge to optimize service delivery. Different service strategies should be implemented based on customers' relational orientation and industry competitive dynamics. The article concludes with logical directions for future research.","['trust', 'economic value', 'competitive intensity', 'relationship norms', 'LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'SWITCHING COSTS', 'PERCEIVED VALUE', 'TRUST', 'SATISFACTION', 'QUALITY', 'COMMITMENT', 'MODEL', 'CAPABILITIES']","['trust', 'competitive intensity', 'relationship norms', 'trust', 'model']","['service performance', 'customer loyalty intentions', 'trust', 'organizational relationship']",0.25,0.2
"Purpose - This paper seeks to provide a tool for decision makers to make more informed decisions regarding their outsourcing decisions and selection of the appropriate supplier. Design/methodology/approach - The method uses the Taguchi loss function for the inclusion of intangibles in the evaluation and selection of suppliers. Intangibles are defined as factors that have an impact on the selection of an appropriate supplier but are not easily quantified to be included in the financial evaluation. These intangibles are classified as the benefits and risks of using a supplier to perform the outsourcing function. A decision maker has certain expectations regarding these intangibles and a loss occurs when a supplier's performance does not meet the decision maker's expectations. The Taguchi loss function has been selected as a means of measuring the loss. The decision maker defines the target value and the specification limits for each benefit and risk category. The weighted loss scores are calculated where the weights are the importance ratings assigned to benefit/risk categories by the decision maker. Based on this analysis each supplier will receive a weighted loss score for all the pertinent benefit categories and one weighted loss score for all the risk categories. To achieve a single measure, the aforementioned weighted loss scores are combined to determine a single aggregate loss score for each supplier, which is then used to rank them. The supplier who receives the highest ranking (minimum loss score) will be selected to perform the outsourcing function. Findings - The procedure proposed here can help companies to identify the best supplier to perform an outsourcing function. Originality/value - The paper presents a phased decision model that begins with economic evaluation and then uses Taguchi functions to measure the impact of intangibles.","['Intangible assets', 'Taguchi methods', 'Outsourcing', 'Supplier evaluation', 'SERVICE', 'SYSTEM', 'MODEL']","['outsourcing', 'model']","['outsourcing', 'intangibles', 'performance']",0.3333333333333333,0.5

"Research Summary: Although partnerships have been conceptualized as vehicles for value creation, less is known about which partners appropriate more value out of them, especially among public organizations. We theorize how politics and procedural rationality in decisionmaking respectively are associated with value creation and value appropriation from partnerships between public organizations. Analysis of data from the Dutch water authority sector (2008-2014) shows that organizations employing more politics in decision-making appropriate more value from horizontal partnerships, whereas procedural rationality in decision-making may enhance combined value creation but limits partner-level value appropriation. Also as theorized, the collective decision-making context constrains value appropriation by partners using a discrepant decision-making approach. We discuss implications for research on public organizations, alliances, and strategic decision-making. Managerial Summary: Although much is known about how partnerships can create value for firms, we know relatively less about which of the partners can appropriate more value from them. In this paper, we theorize and find that (public) organizations that employ more politics in decision-making can generally appropriate more value from partnerships. Organizations that are more procedurally rational, which entails the extensive collection and analysis of information to make decisions, are able to create more value for the partnership, but generally appropriate less value from the partnership. Moreover, an organization that has a different decision-making approach than its partners' end up appropriating less value from the partnership. Thus, when forming partnerships, managers should carefully consider the way their potential partners make decisions.","['organizational politics', 'procedural rationality', 'public partnership', 'value appropriation', 'value creation', 'PROCEDURAL RATIONALITY', 'FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'COOPERATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'EFFICIENCY', 'POLITICS', 'MATTER', 'COSTS']","['procedural rationality', 'value appropriation', 'value creation', 'procedural rationality', 'politics']","['value creation', 'rationality', 'decisionmaking', 'alliances', 'strategic decision making']",0.2,0.2

"Auction sellers usually must set a reserve, which is the lowest auction price that they will accept. I propose that anticipated regret and rejoicing affect reserves. Regret occurs when the highest bid exceeds the seller's value for the property but is still below the reserve. Rejoicing occurs when the reserve forces the winning bidder to pay a higher price. The impact of regret and rejoicing can be observed by examining sellers' learning over sequential auctions, particularly when they use a frequency heuristic. Results from an auction experiment with simulated bidders support the impact of anticipated regret and rejoicing on reserves.","['nan', 'NORMAL-FORM GAMES', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'RESPONSIBILITY', 'FREQUENCY', 'CHOICE', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'MECHANISM', 'BEHAVIOR', 'FEEDBACK']",['frequency'],['auctions'],0.0,0.0

"This study theorizes about the behavioral and knowledge creation implications of betting on the losing technology in a competing technology situation and focuses on three main outcomes. First, in a situation with competing technological options, firms that invest initially in the losing technology will be less successful subsequently in building new knowledge in the winning technology because their experience with failure will lead them to update their expectations of the industry and choose to pursue less risky alternatives. Second, two classic risk-reducing strategies investing in both technologies or entering after uncertainty is resolved will not be completely effective. Firms investing in both technologies are likely to suffer the incentive and coordination-driven innovation penalties of generalists, while late entrants will suffer learning disadvantages. Third, the possession of key and relevant complementary assets-upstream and downstream will positively moderate the observed inertial effect on firms that backed the failed technology and generalists that backed both technologies, as these complementary assets will increase incentives to adapt to the winning technology. I find empirical support for my hypotheses using a novel data set on the evolution of the global flat panel display industry from 1964 to 2003 to investigate the technological competition between plasma and liquid crystal displays. Results show that firms initially pursuing plasma generated less subsequent knowledge in liquid crystal displays, and that firms betting on both technologies were also slow to build knowledge in liquid crystal displays.

"Research Summary To examine whether firms use corporate social responsibility (CSR) to insure against stock price risk, we exploit an exogenous shock in stock price risk associated with Regulation SHO whereby the SEC randomly selected pilot firms for which the uptick restriction on short sales no longer applied. A difference-in-differences test reveals that pilot firms increased CSR more than nonpilot firms and that in particular they reduced CSR concerns and increased CSR that impacts stakeholders involved in direct resource exchange. We also find that pilot firm CSR reduced short positions against them and that the effect is stronger for CSR concerns and CSR that impacts directly connected stakeholders. Overall, we document a causal effect of stock price risk on managerial incentives to invest in CSR for risk management. Managerial Summary Corporate social responsibility has many purported benefits, one of which is that it can insure against the adverse stock price effects of negative events. But do managers purposefully use CSR in this way and do such investments provide intended insurance-like benefits? By taking advantage of a natural experiment where a randomly selected set of pilot firms were exposed to elevated short-sale risk unleashed by the SEC regulation, we find evidence that they do. Once the SEC initiated the regulatory change, firms that faced greater risk increased CSR more than firms that did not. In addition, increased CSR lowered short interests in pilot firms' stocks and this reduction is attributable to the insurance-like effect of CSR rather than simply prevention of adverse events.","['CSR', 'insurance-like effect', 'resource allocation', 'short selling', 'stock price risk', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'SHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'EMPIRICAL-TEST', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PHILANTHROPY', 'CSR']","['csr', 'insurance like effect', 'stock price risk', 'management', 'csr']","['corporate social responsibility', 'risk management']",0.0,0.0
"Service delivery often involves a series of events or stages of exchange between a service provider and its customer. At each stage, performance can meet, exceed, or fall below the customer's expectations. This article contributes to the literature by examining how the patterns of distribution (frequency, timing, proximity, and sequence) of service failures and delights affect customers' perceptions of service quality. The authors propose a conceptual model based on mental accounting principles derived from prospect theory and develop a series of research propositions to explicate the links between distribution patterns of service failures/delights and service quality perceptions. The study integrates prospect theory with service encounter research and provides a comprehensive theory-driven platform for exploring the impact of various service failure and delight distribution patterns. In addition, it offers important managerial implications for service design and resource allocation regarding when, how often, how close, and in what order delights and failures should take place to maximize gains from delights and minimize losses from failures.","['service quality', 'service failure', 'service delight', 'prospect theory', 'mental accounting', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'RECOVERY STRATEGIES', 'MODEL', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'FOUNDATIONS', 'EXPERIENCES', 'EXPECTANCY', 'ADJUSTMENT']","['service quality', 'service failure', 'prospect theory', 'mental accounting', 'model', 'expectations']","['service failures', 'delights', 'service quality', 'prospect theory', 'service failures delights', 'service quality', 'service encounter']",0.2857142857142857,0.3333333333333333
"Significant contemporary challenges face an internationalizing firm, including the non-ergodic nature of investment, and the liability of outsidership. Recent revisions to the Uppsala internationalization process model reflect these challenges, whereby insidership is represented as realized, successful foreign market entry. Drawing upon socio-spatial concepts from international business and economic geography, this paper demonstrates the endogeneity of subnational institutions in shaping foreign market insidership within an advanced economy. Employing a multi-method research design with almost 60 subnational actors, the role and interaction of subnational institutions within the internationalization process are explored. Our findings illustrate how customized coalitions of subnational institutions effectively initiate, negotiate and accelerate insidership of inward investment within the foreign market both prior to and during formal entry. Key aspects of this dynamic include communicating tangible and intangible locational resources, initiating functional and relevant business relationships, and facilitating access to codified and tacit knowledge. This paper embellishes the Uppsala internationalization process model by demonstrating the capacity of subnational institutions to participate actively with foreign market insidership, and in so doing advances understanding of how the risk and uncertainty associated with foreign market entry are currently navigated.","['internationalization theories and foreign market entry', 'subnational region', 'multinational corporations (MNCs) and enterprises (MNEs)', 'economic geography', 'social network analysis', 'SUB-NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS', 'INTERNATIONALIZATION PROCESS', 'DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'INWARD INVESTMENT', 'REGION MATTER', 'LOCATION', 'BUSINESS', 'ENTERPRISE', 'PLACE', 'MODEL']","['economic geography', 'internationalization process', 'inward investment', 'location', 'business', 'model']",['foreign market entry'],0.0,0.0
"Research summary: Raters of firms play an important role in assessing domains ranging from sustainability to corporate governance to best places to work. Managers, investors, and scholars increasingly rely on these ratings to make strategic decisions, invest trillions of dollars in capital, and study corporate social responsibility (CSR), guided by the implicit assumption that the ratings are valid. We document the surprising lack of agreement across social ratings from six well-established raters. These differences remain even when we adjust for explicit differences in the definition of CSR held by different raters, implying the ratings have low validity. Our results suggest that users of social ratings should exercise caution in interpreting their connection to actual CSR and that raters should conduct regular evaluations of their ratings.Managerial summary: Ratings of corporate social responsibility (CSR) guide trillions of dollars of investment, but managers, investors, and researchers know little about whether these ratings accurately measure CSR. In practice, there are examples of highly rated firms becoming embroiled in scandals and the same firm receiving sharply different ratings from different rating agencies. We evaluate six of the leading raters and find little overlap in their assessments of CSR. This lack of consensus suggests that social responsibility is challenging to measure reliably and that users of these ratings should be cautious in drawing conclusions about firms based on this data. We encourage the rating agencies to regularly validate their data in an effort to improve the measurement of CSR.

"This study proposes and empirically tests a comprehensive service-profit chain (SPC) framework that links survey-based customer satisfaction (CS), service quality (SQ), and share-of-wallet (SOW) measures to longitudinal data on two outcome variables-customer retention and customer profitability-gathered from a financial services company's internal records. The framework also incorporates other potential determinants of customers' actual behavior and offers several important insights. First, it demonstrates that an interactive customer segment (replacing current offerings with newer ones) is more profitable than are other segments. Second, it augments current knowledge about the SOW-profitability link by revealing that (a) different levels of SOW generate different levels of customer profitability (cross-sectional effect) and different profitability trajectories through time (longitudinal effect), with the high-SOW segment outperforming full- and low-SOW segments, and (b) the longitudinal relationship between SOW and profitability is nonlinear, with heterogeneity in profitability across customers significantly higher than the variability of the observed profitability values over time.","['service-profit chain', 'share of wallet', 'retention behavior', 'multiperiod customer profitability', 'financial services', 'DYNAMIC-MODEL', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS', 'SWITCHING BARRIERS', 'MARKET SHARE', 'SATISFACTION', 'QUALITY', 'IMPACT', 'INTENTIONS', 'RETENTION']","['service profit chain', 'share of wallet', 'financial services', 'satisfaction', 'quality', 'retention']","['service profit chain', 'customer satisfaction', 'service quality', 'of wallet', 'customer retention', 'customer profitability', 'profitability']",0.14285714285714285,0.16666666666666666

"Stories, and their ability to transport their audience, constitute a central part of human life and consumption experience. Integrating previous literature derived from fields as diverse as anthropology, marketing, psychology, communication, consumer, and literary studies, this article offers a review of two decades worth of research on narrative transportation, the phenomenon in which consumers mentally enter a world that a story evokes. Despite the relevance of narrative transportation for storytelling and narrative persuasion, extant contributions seem to lack systematization. The authors conceive the extended transportation-imagery model, which provides not only a comprehensive model that includes the antecedents and consequences of narrative transportation but also a multidisciplinary framework in which cognitive psychology and consumer culture theory cross-fertilize this field of inquiry. The authors test the model using a quantitative meta-analysis of 132 effect sizes of narrative transportation from 76 published and unpublished articles and identify fruitful directions for further research.","['nan', 'ENTERTAINMENT-EDUCATION', 'STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS', 'AFFECTIVE RESPONSES', 'MEDIA ENJOYMENT', 'PERSUASION', 'CONSUMPTION', 'TELEVISION', 'FICTION', 'POWER', 'EMPATHY']","['persuasion', 'consumption']","['narrative transportation', 'storytelling', 'consumer culture', 'meta analysis']",0.0,0.0
"In this paper we draw on work in behavioral learning theory and risk taking to examine whether firms desperate for growth overpay for acquisitions, and we develop a theory of desperation in the context of growth. We suggest two key drivers of such desperation: (1) when a firm's organic growth is low, paying handsomely for acquisitions may be one of the few options for growth, and (2) when a firm becomes dependent on acquisitions for continuing growth, it is vulnerable to overpaying for acquisitions. Although pressures to grow via acquisition can be intense, we also test whether the benefits of acquisition experience-from both acquirers and their advisors-help to prevent overpayment caused by desperation. We test these ideas in a sample of firms in the banking industry between 1994 and 2005. Consistent with this theory of desperation, our results showed that firms desperate for growth are more likely to pay high acquisition premiums. Our findings on the moderating role of acquisition experience showed that advisors' acquisition experience is more helpful than acquirers' own acquisition experience in preventing desperate acquirers from overpaying for a target.","['nan', 'COMMERCIAL BANKING INDUSTRY', 'CORPORATE ACQUISITIONS', 'RISK-TAKING', 'POSTACQUISITION PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL SELECTION', 'THREAT-RIGIDITY', 'MERGERS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'MANAGEMENT']",['risk taking'],"['behavioral', 'risk', 'desperate for growth', 'acquisition experience']",0.0,0.0
"This study examines the emotion blends and the subsequent customer reactions that occur in advantaged price inequality situations, that is, when consumers learn that retailers charged them a lower price than what the same retailers charged another customer. Drawing on the appraisal theories of emotion and on social comparison theory, an experiment (n=272) and a field study (n=261) are conducted. The results reveal that in advantaged price inequality situations, customers experience a host of positive and negative emotions depending on two factors: the quality of relationship that the customer has with a disadvantaged other customer (neutral, positive, or negative) and the attribution of agency for the price advantage (situational attribution to competition, external attribution to store policies, or internal attribution to customer abilities). Positive emotions include happiness, gratitude, pride, and malicious joy; while negative emotions include pity, outrage, and guilt. These emotions are shown to mediate the occurrence of customer reactions (i.e., customer satisfaction, loyalty, WOM referral, and WOM activity). The article concludes with theoretical implications and recommendations for retail practitioners on how to use dynamic pricing. (C) 2011 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"In this paper, three points are argued. The first is that Ronald Coase, best known as the forefather of transaction cost theory, foresaw many of the critical questions that proponents of the resource-based vie v are concerned with today. The second is that resource-based theory plays a potentially much more critical role in economic theory and in explaining the institutional structure of production than even many resource-based scholars recognize. The last point is that a more complete understanding of the organization of economic activity requires a greater sensitivity to the interdependence of production and exchange relations. The arguments presented in this paper highlight important, but relatively ignored, elements in Coase's work that inform strategy research. Afore importantly, this paper makes the case for a triangular alignment between the triumvirate of governance structure, transaction, and resource attributes and demonstrates how the identity and strategy of a particular firm influences how its resources interact with the transaction and how the firm chooses to govern it. The general argument is then applied to the context of interfirm collaborative relations, where the key focus is broadened from just cost to also include skills/knowledge and the interdependence between cost and skills with respect to firm boundaries, both in terms of choice and nature. Such a broadening of focus enables its to additionally examine the transacting process as a productive endeavor, which underpins the co-evolution of the competencies of partner firms.

"Hostile takeover attempts are considered a key external governance mechanism aimed at addressing perceived managerial underperformance in a target firm. Studies show that target chief executive officers (CEOs) are usually dismissed shortly after a takeover attempt, regardless of whether the bidder actually completes the acquisition. Yet, little is known about the investment behaviors of target CEOs who actually retain their positions in the wake of an unsuccessful hostile takeover attempt. Engaging with this underexplored governance context, we advance a behaviorally informed model of CEO investment behaviors in response to external governance as a function of the negative performance feedback event of the takeover attempt and the timing of the market's attempt in terms of the stage of the target CEO's tenure. Based on a matched-pair study of 71 failed takeover attempts from 1995 to 2006, we find evidence of a nonlinear relation between target CEO tenure and degree of uncertainty of expected returns in subsequent strategic investments in the wake of a failed hostile takeover attempt. We discuss the implications for research on external governance, behavioral agency, and executives' influences on firm processes and outcomes.","['external corporate governance', 'CEO tenure', 'investment behaviors', 'hostile takeovers', 'R & D', 'CAPEX', 'matched-pair', 'CAREER CONCERNS', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT TURNOVER', 'SYMBOLIC MANAGEMENT', 'DISCIPLINARY ROLE', 'STATUS-QUO', 'OWNERSHIP', 'FIRM', 'TOP']","['ceo tenure', 'investment behaviors', 'matched pair', 'firm']","['performance', 'tenure']",0.0,0.0
"Across the many studies of motion picture box office success, unresolved debates and untested assumptions about the contributing factors persist. Using an accessibility-diagnosticity framework and a meta-analysis of 634 effect sizes from 150 studies, the current article seeks to clarify the relationships of star brand equity and product reviews (from consumers and critics) with box office success. The popularity of stars (market and media appeals) exerts a stronger impact on box office success than their artistic recognition (as per award nominations and wins) at the moment of a movie's release but not over its extended theatrical run. Whereas the impact of popular stars on box office success decreases over time, the influence of artistically recognized stars remains steady. The findings also identify a dual role for critics, who influence consumers' movie choice and predict box office performance by merely reflecting moviegoers' tastes. Finally, this study refutes the assumption that the impact of users' reviews strengthens over time, relative to critics' reviews.","['Cinema', 'Meta-analysis', 'Star brand equity', 'Product reviews', ""Critics' reviews"", ""Users' reviews"", 'Cue diagnosticity', 'WORD-OF-MOUTH', 'FILE-DRAWER PROBLEM', 'PUBLICATION BIAS', 'STAR POWER', 'CRITICAL REVIEWS', 'CRITICS REVIEWS', 'PRODUCT REVIEWS', 'MOVIE STARS', 'ONLINE', 'SUCCESS']","['meta analysis', 'star brand equity', 'product reviews', 'critics reviews', 'users reviews', 'critics reviews', 'product reviews', 'success']","['meta analysis', 'star brand equity', 'product reviews', 'consumers', 'critics', 'artistic recognition', 'reviews']",0.42857142857142855,0.375

"Given the benefits of generalized trust, its determinants receive growing attention in international/cross-cultural management/psychology. This research proposed a gene-dependent climatoeconomic model, integrating multiple types of determinants parsimoniously. Across 53 societies, generalized trust is a multiplicative function not only of climatic demands and wealth (climatoeconomic contextualization), but also of climatic demands, wealth, and the 5-HTTLER S-allele prevalence (gene-dependent climatoeconomic contextualization), mediated by uncertainty avoidance. The climatoeconomic contextualization is present only in societies possessing a low level of the 5-HITLER S-allele prevalence.

The results of our field experiment, and subsequent follow-up interviews and focus groups, collectively suggest that competitive goal structures generally lead to higher levels of motivation within a resource scarce environment. However, our results also suggest that cooperative goal structures can be highly motivating when groups are unfamiliar with one another, as cooperating with unfamiliar groups can provide access to valuable and rare knowledge within such settings.","['nan', 'THE-PYRAMID MARKETS', 'INTERGROUP COMPETITION', 'ACHIEVEMENT ORIENTATION', 'INTERRATER RELIABILITY', 'INTRINSIC MOTIVATION', 'WORKING HARDER', 'OUT-GROUP', 'IN-GROUP', 'IMPACT', 'BASE']",['base'],"['goal structures', 'field experiment', 'motivation']",0.0,0.0

The authors then extend the model by incorporating a measure of the impact of the quality of the knowledge produced by the network ties using the prominence and inertia perspectives, which lead to the incorporation of competing hypotheses and moderating relationships in the model of scientific network evolution. The authors then test the model using longitudinal analysis of 367 U.S. biotechnology firms over a span of 17 years.

"Using a sample of 96 acquisitions that occurred between 1980 and 1984, this study concludes that the departure of executives from acquired firms is harmful to post acquisition performance. The negative effects of departures of the highest ranking executives (such as CEOs, Presidents, and Chairmen) appear to be most severe. Acquisition relatedness, contrary to hypothesis, did not moderate the departure-performance relationship. Finally we find that providing one or more executives with top management team status in the newly combined firm leads to better postacquisition performance. Our study implies that executives from acquired firms are an intrinsic component of the acquired firm's resource base, and that their retention is an important determinant of postacquisition performance.

"This paper systematically reviews previous studies of trust from social, economic and technological perspectives and develops a holistic framework for trust, which can be used to analyse the establishment and maintenance of trust in online transactions, and identify the mechanisms that can be used to increase trust. Trust plays a crucial role in the formation of dependent relationships represented by online transactions, and a holistic treatment of trust is necessary because of the gap that exists between the developments in information systems and our understanding of their social and economic implications, and the impact on the perceived trust of the transacting parties. This review enables us to depict an online transaction through its attributes and context, and systematically map these to identified trust antecedents. The key components and processes of the framework are outlined, and three strands of empirical work are discussed to develop it further. The framework highlights the critical role of institutions in the establishment and maintenance of trust in online transactions, which informs the development of e-commerce and e-business platforms and the underpinning information systems, and facilitates the establishment of mechanisms to induce additional institutions to increase trust in online transactions.","['nan', 'ELECTRONIC MARKETS', 'E-COMMERCE', 'REPUTATION SYSTEMS', 'MODEL', 'BUSINESS', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'MARKETPLACES', 'COOPERATION', 'EXPERIENCE', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['e commerce', 'business']",[],0,0.0
"This research develops the argument that four types of market imperfections (i.e., inefficient firms, externalities, flawed pricing mechanisms and information asymmetries) at once contribute to environmental degradation and that they also provide significant opportunities for the creation of radical technologies and innovative business models. We show that these opportunities establish the foundations for an emerging model of sustainable entrepreneurship, one which enables founders to obtain entregreneurial rents while simultaneously improving local and global social and environmental conditions. To advance this new field, we offer suggestions for a research agenda focusing on two areas: the relationship between market imperfections and entrepreneurial opportunities, and the emerging field of sustainable entrepreneurship.

"Many firms are transforming themselves from vertically integrated organizations into digitally enabled organizations. As firms become more innovative in their technical infrastructures and more competitive in their respective industries/verticals, their extended enterprise models include using their previous enterprise resource planning (ERP) investments as foundations for prioritizing additions and for longer-term strategies. The key issue for many firms is how to leverage their ERP implementation to become better partners and collaborators by enabling digital options to exploit business opportunities. This paper ascertains the contextual conditions under which ERP system implementations have the greatest impact on intention to adopt digital options. Using empirical data, it finds that the impact of ERP implementation on digital-options adoption intention is moderated by a firm's digital-resource readiness. For information systems (IS) practice, the study suggests that firms should view ERP divisibility as an option value generator for supporting new customers and revenue opportunities. For IS research, it relates digital-options theory to specific measurable constructs and to the firm's digital-resource readiness. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","['Customer-relationship management', 'digitally enabled extended enterprise', 'extent of ERP implementation', 'knowledge reach/richness', 'process reach/richness', 'resource readiness', 'supply-chain management', 'INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY', 'REAL OPTIONS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'SUPPLY CHAINS', 'MONTE-CARLO', 'ENTERPRISE', 'ASSIMILATION', 'INTEGRATION', 'MODELS']","['resource readiness', 'enterprise', 'models']","['digital options', 'information systems']",0.0,0.0
"There are two competing hypotheses explaining how innovativeness influences the survival of startups: On the one hand, innovativeness is argued to foster survival-enhancing attributes (e.g., market power and cost efficiency) and capabilities (e.g., absorptive capacity). On the other hand, an innovative startup faces (and bears the associated risks of) liabilities of newness and smallness that exceed those of its non-innovative counterparts. The available empirical literature addressing this theoretical tension mostly supports the former hypothesis; we suggest that this finding is, in part, driven by the common practice of employing an ex post measure that already embodies a degree of success in innovativeness. We use an ex ante measure and find that a startup's innovativeness is negatively associated with its subsequent survival. We also find that entrepreneurs' greater appetite for risk magnifies this negative association. These findings imply that pursuing innovations is not necessarily associated with survival during the early stages of firm development and entails a more complicated start-up process.

"This article contributes to the growing body of research concerning the dynamics and impact of conscious and nonconscious cognitive processes on individual and collective behavior in the workplace. Dual-process theories have occupied the center ground of this literature. However, in recent years, the field of psychology, in which these theories originated, has differentiated two fundamentally different categories of dual-process theory: default-interventionist and parallel-competitive. These alternative conceptions are predicated on incommensurable assumptions, but management and organization studies (MOS) researchers are seemingly oblivious to this important distinction, risking the development of a body of work that is fundamentally incoherent because it is predicated on psychological foundations that are untenable. Whereas default-interventionist accounts have tended to dominate MOS, we argue that parallel-competitive formulations offer a more nuanced and realistic depiction of organizational decision makers as thinking and feeling beings, as reliant on inspiration and the skillful management of emotion and intuition as on cold, calculative cognition. We explore the implications of our arguments for multiple streams of research, spanning strategic management, entrepreneurship, organizational behavior, and human resource management, united by the desire to explicate more comprehensively the behavioral microfoundations and neural substrates of managerial and organizational decision making.","['nan', 'SOCIAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE', 'DUAL-PROCESS THEORIES', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS', 'GUT FEEL', 'CAPABILITIES', 'BIASES', 'MICROFOUNDATIONS', 'INFORMATION', 'MODELS']","['dual process theories', 'psychological foundations', 'microfoundations']",['decision making'],0.0,0.0
"Research SummaryWhy do incumbent firms frequently reject nonincremental innovations? Beyond technical, structural, or economic factors, we propose an additional factor: the degree of the top management team's (TMT) frame flexibility, i.e., their capability to cognitively expand an innovation's categorical boundaries and to cast the innovation as emotionally resonant with the organization's identity, competencies, and competitive boundaries. We argue that inertial forces generally constrict how TMTs perceive innovations, but that frame flexibility can overcome these constraints, increasing the likelihood of adoption and broadening the organization's innovation practices. We advance a theoretical model that relaxes the assumption that cognitive frames are static, showing how they become flexible via categorical positioning, and introduce a role for emotional frames that appeal to organizational members' sentiments and aspirations in innovation adoption. Managerial SummaryConfronting a technological change is one of the most difficult challenges facing any incumbent firm. Technological transitions create pressure for leaders to reframe their mental models while continuing to develop existing capabilities and product category variants. Yet at key junctures in a product class and during technological change, a concrete definition of the firm's innovation boundaries and identity hold a firm hostage to its past. We show how a flexible cognitive frame-coupled with emotional framing-helps leaders and organization members become emotionally engaged in transformation efforts and, in turn, learn about executing nonincremental innovation over time. At technological transitions, perhaps there is no more important role for leaders than to expand their cognitive frames and to infuse these expanded frames with emotion.","['cognition', 'emotion', 'framing', 'incumbent inertia', 'innovation adoption', 'ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY', 'TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY', 'SELF-CATEGORIZATION', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITY', 'PROCESS MANAGEMENT', 'SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS', 'STRATEGIC ACTION', 'AMBIDEXTERITY']","['emotion', 'framing', 'innovation adoption', 'technological change']","['nonincremental innovations', 'management', 'flexibility', 'identity', 'technological change']",0.2,0.25
"Organizations cannot function effectively if their employees do not follow organizational rules and policies. In this paper, we explore why and how employees in two high-tech organizations often broke or bent rules designed to protect their employers' confidential information (CI). The CI protection rules sometimes imposed requirements that disrupted employees' work, forcing employees to choose between CI rule compliance and doing their work effectively and efficiently. Employees in these situations often broke the rules or bent them in ways that enabled employees to meet some of the rules' requirements, while also satisfying other expectations that they faced.

"Research summary: The formation of interorganizational ties is a consequential phenomenon examined in strategic management research. Beckman, Haunschild, and Phillips (2004) is one of the first studies to comprehensively consider interorganizational network change by exploring factors that affect both alliance and board interlock formation. They find that firm-specific uncertainty relates to broadening actions, whereas market-level uncertainty causes firms to reinforce current structures. Our replication considers whether these relationships operate similarly in a differing temporal context. Building from the framework of the original study, we suggest our findings offer intriguing new empirical evidence highlighting the importance of time as a boundary condition in understanding embedded firm actions. Managerial summary: The development of interorganizational relationships, such as alliances and ties between boards of directors, has an important impact on innovation, strategic actions, and firm performance. This study examines whether the dynamics of interorganizational relationship formation remain consistent over time. We replicate earlier work by Beckman and colleagues (2004), but with an expanded data set coveringmore than 20 years. Over this broader time horizon, we find a shift in behavior, with companies facing firm-specific uncertainty seeking to reinforce their current relationships and companies facing industry-wide uncertainty seeking to diversify their risk by expanding their network. Our results demonstrate the importance of replication studies in research and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complexity surrounding interorganizational relationships.

"This research documents the friendly taking effect in choosing consumption packages for the self and others, interpersonal closeness leads to a preference for a self-benefiting package when this package also offers greater total benefit to the self-other collective (studies 1 and 2). We propose that a friendly intention (i.e., concern for the total benefit) underlies the friendly taking effect; therefore, people both take more from and give more to a close (vs. distant) other when doing so offers greater benefits in total (study 3), and people are cognitively tuned in to (e.g., acquire, remember) information about the total benefit more when choosing a package for themselves and a close (vs. distant) other (study 4). Moreover, the importance people place on the total benefit mediates the impact of closeness on people's preference for self-benefiting packages (study 5).

"In this article we address the increasingly important yet understudied phenomenon of nonnative accentedness on decision making. In three experimental studies, we investigated whether messages about a company delivered in nonstandard-American-accented speech influenced choice. In Study 1, we found that individuals were more likely to choose a company or a product when a message was read in a standard American English accent than when the message was delivered with a Mandarin Chinese or a French accent. In Study 2, we found that expectations regarding company messages are violated when speakers have accents and that, in turn, expectation violations mediated the relationship between accent and choice. In Study 3, we replicated the findings of the effect of accent on choice using Indian and British accents. We also hypothesized and found support for a conditional indirect effects model such that implicit pro-American bias moderated the indirect relationship between accent and choice as mediated by expectation violations.

"An examination of consumer information search literature reveals that the effects of several antecedents (cost, price dispersion, knowledge, prior experience) on offline information search vary greatly in terms of the directions and magnitudes of the determinants' effect sizes, particularly indicating the possibility of inverted-U shaped relationships. Also, despite a wide range of studies undertaken, there remains a need for identifying an overarching framework for consumer information search. This article synthesizes previous empirical studies on offline information search literature, and attempts to provide and test a framework that advances our understanding of the current state of this literature. The review identifies significant antecedents to offline information search, and also tests the moderating effects of demographic variables and study conditions on the direct effects. In the context of the main effects, findings suggest that the nature of relationships of several antecedents with the central construct is indeed inverted-U shaped. Further, moderator analyses identify the boundary conditions under which specific theories hold. The closing section provides future research directions. (C) 2014 New York University.

A Web survey of Internet banking users collected 502 cases.

"Investigating the factors that influence venture capital decision-making has a long tradition in the management and entrepreneurship literatures. However, few studies have considered the factors that might bias an investment decision in a way that is idiosyncratic to a given investor-entrepreneur dyad. We do so in this study. Specifically, we build from the literature on the 'similarity effect' to investigate the extent to which decision-making process similarity (shared between the investor and the entrepreneur) might bias or otherwise impact the investor's evaluation of a new venture investment opportunity. Our findings suggest venture capitalists evaluate more favourably opportunities represented by entrepreneurs who 'think' in ways similar to their own. Moreover, in the presence of decision-making process similarity, the impacts of other factors that inform the investment decision actually change in counter-intuitive ways.","['nan', 'VENTURE CAPITALISTS EVALUATIONS', 'RELATIONAL DEMOGRAPHY', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'REGULATORY FIT', 'TRADE-OFFS', 'CRITERIA', 'MODEL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONGRUENCE', 'ATTRACTION']",['decision making'],[],0,0.0
"Purpose This paper aims to investigate the way in which blockchain technology is likely to influence future supply chain practices and policies. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of both academic and practitioner literature was conducted. Multiple accounts of blockchain adoption within industry were also consulted to gain further insight. Findings While blockchain technologies remain in their infancy, they are gaining momentum within supply chains, trust being the predominant factor driving their adoption. The value of such technologies for supply chain management lies in four areas: extended visibility and traceability, supply chain digitalisation and disintermediation, improved data security and smart contracts. Several challenges and gaps in understanding and opportunities for further research are identified by this research. How a blockchain-enabled supply chain should be configured has also been explored from a design perspective. Research limitations/implications - This systematic review focuses on the diffusion of blockchain technology within supply chains, and great care was taken in selecting search terms. However, the authors acknowledge that their choice of terms may have excluded certain blockchain articles from this review. Practical implications - This paper offers valuable insight for supply chain practitioners into how blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt existing supply chain provisions as well as a number of challenges to its successful diffusion. Social implications - The paper debates the poential social and economic impact brought by blockchain. Originality/value - This paper is one of the first studies to examine the current state of blockchain diffusion within supply chains. It lays a firm foundation for future research.","['Design', 'Supply-chain management', 'Impact', 'Systematic literature review', 'New technology', 'Information transparency', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL NETWORKS', 'SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'DESIGN SCIENCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'TRUST', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LEVEL', 'BASE']","['design', 'supply chain management', 'impact', 'management', 'trust', 'knowledge']","['blockchain', 'trust', 'supply chain management']",0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
"Effective governance of distributors represents a critical success factor for firms operating in emerging markets such as China. To increase understanding of this issue, the authors adopt a role theory framework to delineate the effect of fit between governance strategies and distributor role orientations on channel outcomes. They also examine the way two contingency factors (relationship stages and market uncertainty) may moderate the impact of this fit. Using a four-industry survey of distributors in China, the authors confirm the salience of strategic fit between the manufacturer's governance strategy and the distributor's role orientation (in short, governance fit), in support of propositions postulated in recent channel governance research. The findings also indicate that the effects of this governance fit are dependent on the stages of the channel relationship (buildup versus mature) but not market uncertainty. This study extends the current literature and suggests the need for finer, phase-oriented dynamic governance strategies in the Chinese market.","['role theory', 'channel management', 'governance strategy', 'Chinese market', 'STRATEGIC FIT', 'PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS', 'CHINA', 'OPPORTUNISM', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'INFORMATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'MECHANISMS', 'GENERATION', 'VARIABLES']","['role theory', 'governance strategy', 'chinese market', 'strategic fit', 'china']","['effective governance', 'china', 'market uncertainty']",0.3333333333333333,0.2
"A firm's strategic investments in knowledge-based assets through research and development (R&D) can generate economic rents for the firm, and thus are expected to affect positively a firm's financial performance. However, weak protection of minority shareholders, weak property rights, and ineffective law enforcement can allow those rents to be appropriated disproportionately by a firm's powerful insiders such as large owners and top managers. Recent data on Chinese publicly listed firms during 2007-2012 were used to demonstrate that the expected positive relationship between knowledge assets and performance is weaker in transition economies when a firm's ownership is highly concentrated and its managers have wide discretion. Moreover, rent appropriation by insiders was shown to vary with the levels of institutional development in which a firm operates. Managerial summary: Investing in knowledge-based intangible assets (e.g., R&D) is an important value-creation activity for the firm. Such value creation process can be facilitated by large shareholders and powerful managers, who can then take an advantageous position with critical insider information on these valuable intangible assets and therefore enjoy more opportunities to appropriate more value from them, leaving less value for other minority shareholders. The value distribution becomes increasingly skewed against minority shareholders when the institutional protection for them is weak. Indeed, in a large sample of Chinese publicly listed firms, we found that R&D investment becomes less positively associated with firm financial performance with the presence of large shareholders, high managerial equity, or CEO/Chairman duality, especially in Chinese provinces with weak institutional development.

"Despite the prevalence of governmental action devised to foster firms and industries, the link between industrial policy (IP) and competitive advantage has received scant attention in strategic management. I propose a model where such a link is mediated by the accumulation and churning of local resources and capabilities. I also introduce the concept of support-adjusted sustainable competitive advantage (SASCA), which occurs if a firm's observed performance is superior to the expected performance of competitors had they received the same array of policies. I argue that achieving SASCA through IP is a difficult endeavor and requires the interplay of three conditions: insertion in global production networks, geographical specificity, and governmental capability.

"The impact of market share on financial firm performance is one of the most widely studied relationships in marketing strategy research. However, since the meta-analysis by Szymanski, Bharadwaj, and Varadarajan (1993), substantial environmental (e.g., digitization) and methodological (e.g., accounting for endogeneity) developments have occurred. The currentwork presents an updated and extended meta-analysis based on all available 863 elasticities drawn from 89 studies and provides the following new empirical generalizations: (1) The average raw market share-financial performance elasticity is.132, which is substantially lower than the effectiveness of other intermediate marketing metrics. This result challenges a widely used strategy that solely focuses on increasing market share. (2) Elasticities differ significantly between contextual settings. For example, they are lower for business-to-business firms than for business-to consumer firms, for service firms than for manufacturing firms, and for U.S. markets than for emerging and Western European markets.

"Although most consumer self-control decisions are made individually, they are rarely made in isolation. Temptations are often simultaneously encountered by multiple members of a group or dyad and thereby susceptible to social influence. However, little is known about these parallel self-control decisions or the resulting social consequences. In a series of studies spanning the domains of money, time management, and food consumption, consumers demonstrated a tendency to bond over matched self-control decisions through coindulgence or coabstinence. The perceived severity of choosing vice over virtue influenced when each of these matched outcomes produced greater affiliation. When indulgence threatened to seriously hinder goal progress, consumers bonded through moral support evidenced by joint abstention. When the consequences were perceived as relatively less severe, consumers found friendship through partnering in crime by both indulging. Throughout, guilt underlies the relationship between self-control behaviors and social outcomes, as peer compliance reduces guilt and thus improves affiliation.","['nan', 'CONSUMER', 'AFFILIATION', 'PREFERENCES', 'ATTITUDES', 'BEHAVIOR', 'PURSUIT', 'OTHERS', 'MODEL', 'GUILT']","['consumer', 'affiliation', 'behavior', 'guilt']","['self control', 'coindulgence']",0.0,0.0
"Despite much academic work and the development of multiple typologies, we are still some way from understanding the HR role. There is a dearth of empirical evidence on HR professionals' work and recent models have been criticized for not adequately reflecting the challenges of trying to balance competing stakeholder interests. We approach this lacuna by focusing on an issue that has not been fully considered in relation to HR work - emotion. Drawing on the findings of a broader study into emotional labour, we highlight the emotive challenges inherent in the day-to-day practice of HR. We explore the disjunctions between felt' emotions and those actually displayed to meet differing stakeholders' expectations. We show how achieving an appropriate emotion display is a challenging pursuit given these competing expectations. Our contribution is to elucidate emotional labour in the under-researched backstage' professional context, and through our emotion focus to extend our understanding of the complexity of the HR role beyond current prescriptive models.","['display rules', 'emotion', 'emotional labour', 'HR role', 'role expectations', 'LABOR', 'SERVICE', 'WORK', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'WORKPLACE', 'IDENTITY', 'SMILE']","['emotion', 'emotional labour', 'hr role', 'work']","['emotion', 'emotional']",0.5,0.25

"Although sustained superior firm performance may arise from skillful management or other valuable, rare, and inimitable resources, it can also result from randomness. Studying U.S. companies from 1965-2008, we benchmark how long a firm must perform at a high level to be confident that it is something other than the outcome of a time-homogeneous stationary Markov chain defined on the state space of percentiles.

"How does market power affect consumer perceptions and purchase behavior? In the theoretically and pragmatically important context of price increases, we theorize that (i) consumer price fairness perceptions decline with market power when a price increase is due to costs; and (ii) this fairness difference arises due to greater perceptions of controllability and, in turn, exploitation by firms with higher market power. Consistent with our theorizing, we further argue that market power does not affect fairness (iii) when prices rise due to demand (which is perceived as equally exploitative and unfair regardless of firm power) or (iv) when price increases are clearly beyond the firm's control (and perceived as equally fair for firms with high and low market power). We provide empirical support for these predictions in a series of behavioral experiments combined with an analysis of retail scanner data. Together, our findings shed light on how market power and pricing actions jointly drive consumer perceptions of unfairness, with implications for firms' pricing strategies, competition in the retail marketplace, and the principle of dual entitlement as a community standard of fairness in pricing.

"Machiavellians are said to be manipulative people who reduce the social capital of the organization. Yet some authors note that Machiavellians are also highly adaptive individuals who are able to contribute, cooperate, and use pro-social strategies when it is advantageous to them. Here we study whether transformational leader behavior can stimulate Machiavellian followers to engage in organizationally desirable behaviors such as challenging organizational citizenship behavior. We hypothesized and found in two multi-source field studies that transformational leadership moderates the relationship between Machiavellianism and challenging organizational citizenship behavior. In Study 2, we hypothesized a moderated mediation model and found that enhanced job autonomy and accompanying intrinsic motivation relating to transformational leadership explain (part of) the relationship between transformational leader behavior and challenging citizenship behavior of Machiavellian followers.","['Machiavellianism', 'challenging organizational citizenship behavior', 'transformational leadership', 'autonomy', 'intrinsic motivation', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP', 'CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'PROACTIVE BEHAVIOR', 'EMPLOYEE VOICE', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'DARK TRIAD', 'PERSONALITY']","['machiavellianism', 'challenging organizational citizenship behavior', 'transformational leadership', 'autonomy', 'intrinsic motivation', 'transformational leadership', 'citizenship behavior']","['machiavellians', 'transformational leadership', 'mediation', 'job autonomy', 'intrinsic motivation']",0.4,0.2857142857142857
"Building long-term, profitable, customer relationships has become a strategic mandate for service firms. In this research, the authors present a modeling framework for understanding the decision of a noncontractual customer to strengthen the relationship with the firm by migrating to a contractual relationship. Drawing upon expected utility theory, the customer migration decision is modeled as a function of expected gains (actual expectations of service usage) and losses (price of the noncontractual service). In addition, the authors investigate the direct and indirect effects of the age of the noncontractual relationship and propose a model to understand the process of expectations formation. The framework is tested empirically in a business-to-consumer context in mobile communications services. The findings provide strong support for the proposed model and they reveal that actual expected service usage and noncontractual price increase the probability of the customer migrating to a contract, and that relationship age has both direct (positive) and indirect (through expected service usage) effects on the studied behavior. The present study also provides new theoretical and empirical insights into the formation of actual customer usage expectations. Finally, the study findings have several important implications for service managers to strengthen their relationships with their current noncontractual customers. For example, they need to proactively manage customers' actual expectations about future service usage in order to increase a customer's probability to migrate to a contract.","['relationship marketing', 'migration to contractual relationships', 'forward-looking focus', 'random effects model', 'services industries', 'mobile communications', 'BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS', 'BRAND CHOICE', 'DYNAMIC-MODEL', 'SERVICE QUALITY', 'TARIFF-CHOICE', 'SATISFACTION', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'RETENTION', 'FRAMEWORK', 'MARKET']","['mobile communications', 'expectations', 'framework']","['expected utility theory', 'customer migration', 'usage']",0.0,0.0

"Guided by insights from cognitive theories, this article explores the links between entrepreneurs' prior business ownership experience and their opportunity identification behavior. Hypotheses were tested using data from 630 entrepreneurs. Experienced entrepreneurs identified more opportunities and exploited more innovative opportunities with greater wealth creation potential. Entrepreneurs that had owned more than 4.5 businesses, however, identified fewer opportunities. The nature of prior business ownership experience also shaped opportunity identification behavior. An inverse U-shaped relationship was detected between the proportion of failed businesses relative to the number of businesses owned and the number of opportunities identified in a given period. Business failure experience was not associated with the innovativeness of exploited opportunities. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We studied regional innovation relays as MNC regional offices that mediate between knowledge generation at the local level and knowledge application at the global level. The significance of the region as a nexus of innovation is illustrated by concrete examples from U.S. and Japanese MNCs. The role of regional management for the MNC's innovation system hinges precisely on the need for linkages between knowledge embedded in locally conducted activities and innovation exploited at the global level by the MNC. A framework of regionally facilitated innovation illuminates this process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

"A substantial body of research has examined the antecedents of innovation in organizational settings, but our current understanding of how social aspects of the work environment influence the innovative behavior of employees remains underdeveloped. One of these social aspects connected to the theme of doing well by doing good concerns organizational care, with scholars examining how actions centered on promoting employee well-being may result in pro-organizational outcomes. The purpose of this study is to present a conceptual analysis of the intricate relationship between organizational care and employees' innovative behavior by detailing key mediating mechanisms and conditional factors. This research will combine insights from multiple theories and literatures, most notably self-determination theory, social exchange theory, and the literatures on organizational care, work motivation, and innovation. The proposed multilevel model clarifies how organizational care affects the creative, complex, and mundane elements of employees' innovative behavior through its effect on the motivational constructs of intrinsic motivation, identified motivation, and introjected obligation feelings, respectively. Moreover, the model highlights the potential dark sides of organizational care that managers must consider when designing and implementing caring policies and practices. Specifically, it clarifies how the effect of organizational care on employees' innovative behavior may depend on their subjective perceptions of care intrusiveness and care insincerity. As such, this study responds to calls for rich and nuanced conceptual research in the innovation field, especially concerning the role of employees' social work environment in motivating their innovative behavior. Important theoretical and practical implications of this conceptual analysis will be discussed, and valuable directions for future research will be outlined.","['nan', 'SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY', 'LEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'AUTHENTIC LEADERSHIP', 'INTRINSIC MOTIVATION', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'WORK-ENVIRONMENT', 'CREATIVITY', 'SUPPORT', 'COMMITMENT', 'MODERATOR']","['self determination theory', 'intrinsic motivation', 'work environment']","['innovation', 'organizational care', 'self determination theory social exchange', 'motivation', 'model', 'intrinsic motivation']",0.16666666666666666,0.3333333333333333

"Researchers have reported a positive, negative, and neutral impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on financial performance. This inconsistency may be due to flawed empirical analysis. In this paper, we demonstrate a particular flaw in existing econometric studies of the relationship between social and financial performance. These studies estimate the effect of CSR by regressing firm performance on corporate social performance, and several control variables. This model is misspecified because it does not control for investment in R&D, which has been shown to be an important determinant of firm performance. This misspecification results in upwardly biased estimates of the financial impact of CSR. When the model is properly specified we find that CSR has a neutral impact on financial performance.

A measure is developed to assess the stability of the top 10 shareholders of 134 leading companies in the six Japanese industrial groups-Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, DKB, Sanwa, and Fuyo-over the 1973-93 period. The results demonstrate the use by these companies of their networks of stable shareholdings as a strategic response to deal with threats to group company governance structures arising from the stock market and property boom of the late 1980s (known in Japan as the 'bubble' economy) and its aftermath.

"This study examines the autonomous goals of state actors and their administrative and cultural capacities to pursue them. Analyzing qualitative and quantitative data from Palestine/Israel during the years 1940-1960, we study the diffusion of joint productivity councils that use scientific management principles (scientific JPCs). We assess explanations for the diffusion of managerial models offered by theories of state autonomy, efficiency, labor control, and professionalization. We demonstrate that the actions of state leaders interested in stabilizing the economy and financing nation-building projects were a necessary condition for the diffusion of scientific JPCs, which were initially rejected by labor, capital, and industrial engineers. State actors used public policy to foster national and plant-level agreements between labor and capital and launched a moral discourse that framed productivity as a precondition for national survival. This case study brings insights from political sociology and the framing literature to organizational research and offers a new set of factors for understanding the nexus between the state, the labor process, and the diffusion of managerial models.","['nan', 'SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS', 'FORMAL-STRUCTURE', 'UNITED-STATES', 'POLITICS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'POLICY', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'LEGISLATION', 'COMPETITION']","['management', 'policy']",[],0,0.0

The purpose is to: (i) develop an understanding when conflict exists; (ii) suggest how the conflict can be structured; and (iii) present conflict design alternatives that maximize the multinational corporations' interest over the interest of the subsidiary. This article proposes that subsidiary self-interest in technology transfer situations may only be detrimental to the overall success of the MNC if products are easy to copy, the host environment has the technological and managerial capabilities to expropriate and the technology represents a competitive advantage. In situations where it is likely that the technology transfer is vulnerable to expropriation headquarters is advised to establish an independent pool of information of expropriation risks, to build trust by starting with small scale technology transfer and to signal career perspectives to subsidiary managers. As a result, the creation of a cooperative climate reduces subsidiary opportunism and information asymmetries.

"Marketing inherited a model of exchange from economics, which had a dominant logic based on the exchange of goods, which usually are manufactured output. The dominant logic focused on tangible resources, embedded value, and transactions. Over the past several decades, new perspectives have emerged that have a revised logic focused on intangible resources, the cocreation of value, and relationships. The authors believe that the new perspectives are converging to form a new dominant logic for marketing, one in which service provision rather than goods is fundamental to economic exchange. The authors explore this evolving logic and the corresponding shift in perspective for marketing scholars, marketing practitioners, and marketing educators.","['nan', 'SERVICES', 'ORIENTATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'EVOLUTION', 'PRODUCTS', 'CHAIN', 'MODEL', 'VIEW']",['model'],"['exchange', 'dominant logic']",0.0,0.0
"Research Summary: This paper explores the stock market performance of acquisitions and divestitures where both, one, or neither of the companies in the transaction are family firms. We find that acquirer shareholder returns are highest when family firms buy businesses from non-family firm divesters, especially when family chief executive officer (CEO) acquirers buy businesses from non-family CEO divesters. Additionally, divester shareholder returns are highest when family firms sell businesses to non-family firm acquirers, especially when family CEO divesters sell businesses to non-family CEO acquirers. These findings reveal that it is important to consider the characteristics of both the acquiring and divesting firms when analyzing acquisition and divestiture performance, and that the expected gains to family firm acquisitions and divestitures are driven by transactions in which the counterparties are non-family firms. Managerial Summary: This paper explores how investors react to acquisitions and divestitures where both, one, or neither of the companies in the deal are family firms. The stock market performance of acquiring firms is highest when family firms buy businesses from non-family firms, relative to the other three possible combinations of family and non-family firm acquirers and divesters. Likewise, the stock market performance of divesting firms is highest when family firms sell businesses to non-family firms, again relative to the other three possible combinations of family and non-family acquirers and divesters. These findings suggest that investors take into consideration the identities of both the acquiring and divesting firms when evaluating acquisitions and divestitures, and that this has significant implications for the expected performance gains of these transactions.","['acquisitions', 'corporate strategy', 'divestitures', 'family firms', 'shareholder returns', 'INTERNAL CAPITAL-MARKETS', 'AGENCY COSTS', 'SOCIOEMOTIONAL WEALTH', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'RISK-TAKING', 'CEO DUALITY', 'CASH FLOW', 'DARK SIDE', 'INVESTMENT']","['acquisitions', 'divestitures', 'family firms', 'shareholder returns']","['acquisitions', 'divestitures', 'family firms']",1.0,0.75

"Through an in-depth, historically embedded study of the craft revolution in Dutch beer brewing that began in the 1970s, we illuminate how organizational fields may experience regenerative change through the reemergence of traditional arrangements. The remarkable resurgence of craft in this context, following the rapid industrialization of the twentieth century that left only industrially produced pilsner in its wake, serves as the basis of our process theory of regenerative institutional change through logic reemergence. The results of our qualitative analysis show that institutional logics that appear dead or decomposed may never truly die, as they leave remnants behind that field actors can rediscover, repurpose, and reuse at later stages. We show how, in the Netherlands, networks of individuals that had access to the remnants of craft brewing were regenerated, in part fueled by increasing exposure to British, Belgian, and German craft brewing, and how these networks ultimately succeeded in reviving traditional prescriptions for beer and brewing, as well as restoring previously abandoned brewery forms and technologies and beer styles. These activities led not only to a sudden proliferation of alternatives to the dominant industrial pilsner but also to fundamental changes in the meaning and organization of beer brewing, as they were associated with the reinvigoration of institutional orders that preceded those of the corporation and the market. Yet we also observe how, on the ground, remnants of traditional craft often needed to be blended with contemporaneous elements from modern industrialism, as well as foreign representations of craft, to facilitate reemergence. We thus argue that regenerative institutional change likely resembles a dualistic process of restoration and transformation.","['regenerative change', 'institutional logics', 'reemergence', 'craft', 'tradition', 'institutional remnants', 'Dutch craft beer brewing', 'ORGANIZATIONAL LEGITIMACY', 'COLLECTIVE MEMORY', 'COMPETING LOGICS', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'MOVEMENT', 'FIELD', 'DYNAMICS', 'INDUSTRY', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'CRAFT']","['regenerative change', 'institutional logics', 'reemergence', 'craft', 'tradition', 'field', 'transformation', 'craft']",['craft revolution'],0.0,0.0
"Purpose - Hyperconnectivity and supercooperation among partners within the mobile value chain are crucial factors for sustainable growth of the mobile ecosystem. This study aims to identify the complex structure of hyperconnectivity and supercooperation underlying revenue sharing practices and the actions and reactions of Chinese mobile video triads. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses the causal loop diagram and system dynamics simulation to demonstrate the feedback causal structure wherein the revenue sharing (RS) rule adjustments trigger interactions among participants (e.g., MNOs, SPs and CPs) in mobile video service triads, leading to fluctuations in the number of mobile video users and total revenue in the mobile video value chain. Findings - Change of RS rules among value chain participants is an incentive for achieving the sustainability of the mobile ecosystem, as examined using a system dynamics (SD) simulation. However, from the perspective of a tri-partite mobile value chain, the accidental adversary system archetype caused by adjustment of RS rules has an unintended negative impact on counterparts in the mobile ecosystem value chain. Originality/value - This study analyzes a complex feedback causal structure based on structural interdependencies among growth, limiting and relaxing loops in the Chinese mobile video ecosystem. The result of SD simulation suggests strategic alternatives such as the growth and underinvestment systems archetype to overcome limits to growth. Moreover, this study explores the accidental adversary archetype in complex and complicated mobile service triads as an impediment to achieving sustainability of the mobile ecosystem.","['Systems analysis', 'Value chain', 'SCM practices', 'Closed loop supply chains', 'Revenue sharing', 'Hyperconnectivity', 'Accidental adversary', 'Chinese mobile video value chain', 'SUPPLY CHAIN', 'WHOLESALE-PRICE', 'COORDINATION', 'DYNAMICS', 'COMPETITION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'CONTRACTS', 'PRODUCTS', 'STRATEGY', 'INDUSTRY']","['value chain', 'revenue sharing', 'hyperconnectivity', 'accidental adversary', 'dynamics']","['purpose hyperconnectivity', 'value chain', 'ecosystem', 'revenue sharing', 'chinese mobile video triads', 'causal loop diagram', 'system dynamics simulation', 'impact']",0.25,0.4
"Increasingly, strategy scholars are exploring the relationships between innovation, competition, and the persistence of superior profits. Sustained high profitability may result when a firm repeatedly introduces valuable innovations that service previously unmet consumer demands. While the returns to the firm from each innovation may erode over time, innovation ensures that, overall, the firm maintains a high performance position. At the same time, sustained high profitability may also accrue to firms that innovate less often, but effectively avoid the competition that otherwise erodes high returns. This paper elaborates these relationships before presenting an empirical analysis of the effects of differential innovative propensities and differential rates of competition on pharmaceutical firms' abilities to sustain profit outcomes that are above those earned by competing firms. The analysis, which is situated within the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, finds support for the expected relationship between high innovative propensity and sustained superior profitability but no support for a link between persistence and the ability to avoid competition.

"We develop a socioemotional wealth explanation for the differences in earnings quality between family firms. We argue that the process by which families obtain ownership of firms is a key contingency affecting earnings quality.

Acquired family firms benefit with respect to their earnings quality from having a nonfamily CEO while nonacquired family firms benefit from having a family CEO.","['identity', 'earnings quality', 'acquired family firms', 'nonacquired family firms', 'socioemotional wealth', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'AGENCY', 'STEWARDSHIP', 'REFORMS', 'BOARD']","['earnings quality', 'acquired family firms', 'nonacquired family firms', 'socioemotional wealth', 'ownership']","['socioemotional wealth', 'earnings quality', 'family firms']",0.6666666666666666,0.4
"While much is understood about the general pattern of industry dynamics, a critical element underlying these dynamics, the rate of the expansion of individual firms, has been largely overlooked. We argue that the rate at which firms can reliably increase their scale of operations is a critical factor in understanding the structure of industries. Further, success at scaling-up the firm's operations provides a dynamic-isolating mechanism that insulates established firms from new competition. We show that the bases of profitability in the industry (monopoly-like profits stemming from the restriction of output, efficiency rents based on firm-specific productivity differences, or transitory Schumpeterian profits) can be traced to the scale adjustment process. We explore these issues in a computational model of industry dynamics.

"It can be argued that job evaluation and a high performance work strategy are either conflictual or compatible. On the one hand, job evaluation might be expected to introduce a greater degree of rigidity and top-down orientation to the pay and job structure, potentially yielding a conflict with the flexibility and employee involvement inherent in the high performance approach. On the other hand, job evaluation can be important in generating a feeling of equity in the workplace and thereby in promoting the high level of trust and commitment on which the success of the high performance strategy is seen to depend. This paper indicates that those workplaces in which the high performance approach has been most fully implemented are less likely to have the more formal, analytical type of job evaluation. Furthermore, those with both analytical job evaluation and a high performance work system are less likely to have above-average financial performance than those with either of these on a single basis. The results therefore suggest that there is a potential incompatibility between some types of job evaluation and the high performance approach and that managers need to take this into account in their human resource strategies.","['nan', 'HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'INDUSTRIAL-RELATIONS', 'PAY', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'SYSTEMS', 'UNIONS', 'IMPACT']","['financial performance', 'pay']",[],0,0.0
"Consumers' existing habits are a key driver of resistance to new product use. In an initial survey to identify this role of habit, consumers reported on products that they had purchased intending to use. They also reported whether or not they actually used them. For one-quarter of the products they failed to use, consumers slipped back into old habits despite their favorable intentions. However, consumers effectively used new products when integrating them into existing habits. A four-week experiment with a new fabric refresher confirmed that habit slips impeded product use, especially when participants thought minimally about their laundry and thus were vulnerable to habit cues. However, slips were minimized when the new product was integrated into existing laundry habits. Thus, in launching new products, managers will want to consider consumer habits that conflict with product use as well as ways to embed products into existing habits.","['Habits', 'Resistance', 'Action slip', 'Implementation intentions', 'IMPLEMENTATION INTENTIONS', 'INNOVATION RESISTANCE', 'PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'METAANALYSIS', 'ADOPTION', 'COMPLEX']","['habits', 'resistance']",['laundry'],0.0,0.0
"Despite the centrality of fields as a concept in organizational research, the processes by which fields form and change have not been studied in great depth. By situating action in time and space, field-configuring events (FCEs) offer valuable settings for researchers seeking insight into such processes. This paper develops a theory of accounts as a way to understand a mechanism by which institutional entrepreneurs seek to shape fields and influence the institutions that govern them. Actors produce and distribute justified accounts - narratives that describe the way work in the field ought to be done - and attempt to persuade powerful actors in the field to adopt them as conventions. FCEs can thus be understood as loci for conventionalizing accounts. The theory of accounts and field-level change is illustrated with a case study of a turning point FCE during which competing institutional entrepreneurs in the field of 'non-profit technology assistance providers' present alternative accounts. Successful institutional entrepreneurship comes from recognizing political opportunities to align one's account with the dominant orders of worth in the field, thereby convincing powerful actors to accept one's account as convention.","['nan', 'INSTITUTIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'TOURNAMENT RITUALS', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'SOCIOLOGY', 'NONPROFIT', 'INDUSTRY', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'ETHNOGRAPHY', 'EMERGENCE', 'DYNAMICS']",['institutional entrepreneurship'],"['fields', 'theory', 'accounts', 'institutional entrepreneurship']",0.25,1.0

The negative effect on global market leadership of excessive loan-acquiring capability is amplified under business-friendly market institutions that ease access to credit. Managerial capability to utilize resources productively positively moderates the relationship between loan-acquiring capability and global market leadership.

Questioning the field's ontological dualism between individualism and societism, we engage with practice theory's relational ontology and its main conceptual and methodological ideas. From this we develop a practice-based theory of diversity, arguing that practices and their connections, not individuals or discourses, are the unit of analysis to best study and understand the social life of a diverse organization. We apply this theoretical lens to (in)equality through two research examples, showing how the practicing of career mentoring is connected to other inequality-(re)producing practices and how the equal social order of a dance organization is accomplished through the situated practice of mixing. In the discussion we highlight the value of a practice theory for diversity. A practice-based theory of diversity renews the research agenda of diversity studies, forwarding post-dualistic forms of theorizing, reconceptualizing diversity practices along the theoretical logic of practice, and conceiving of diversity-related phenomena as the net effect of social order-producing practices.","['nan', 'MENTORING RELATIONSHIPS', 'CREATIVE INDUSTRIES', 'MANAGING DIVERSITY', 'AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION', 'WORK', 'GENDER', 'DIFFERENCE', 'DISCOURSE', 'CONTEXT', 'WOMEN']",['discourse'],"['practice', 'diversity']",0.0,0.0

"Purpose - This paper aims to analyse available multimodal transport route variations for iron ore shipments from northwest Australia to northeast China, focusing on a major iron and steel manufacturer. Design/methodology/approach - The research is focused on a case study and uses an established cost model as a framework, for the first time, in the context of heavy bulk cargo shipments. Field interviews and a questionnaire form the principal methods of primary data collection. The characteristics of bulk iron ore transport flow are analysed against traditional criteria and an appraisal of the transport infrastructure in north east China is made, considering both road and rail options, and various possible combinations for transport being evaluated. All factors affecting modal choice in the region are examined, including cargo volume, weight, and value, transport distance, transit time, transport costs and schedule reliability. Findings - The volumes of iron ore moved are large, with a high weight-to-volume ratio, and shipments are regular. The research initially confirms that sea and rail transport combinations are the most appropriate for the movement of iron ore. However, where rail transport corridors are congested, provided that the transport distances are not too great, road haulage appears to be an effective substitute and the most competitive multimodal transport route, at least in the short to medium term, is found to be a rail-sea-road combination via Port Bayuquan in China. Research limitations/implications - The research focuses on the delivery of iron ore to one major steel manufacturer in northeast China; so findings may not be transferable to other companies or circumstances. Practical implications - The paper first demonstrates that, for heavy, high volume cargoes concentration of flows on to one corridor, perhaps under the control of one service provider, maximises scale economies, but works against competition and route/mode choice. Second, it demonstrates that, for long haul shipments of iron ore, port variations and modal differences for inland transport yield only marginal differences in overall logistics costs. Originality/value - An assessment of high volume/heavy/low value cargoes such as iron ore has not previously been undertaken using this cost model. This paper therefore provides an original analysis of such supply chains.","['Transportation', 'Australia', 'China', 'Costs', 'Iron', 'nan']","['australia', 'china', 'costs', 'iron']",[],0,0.0
"Drawing from the foundation of positive psychology and the recently emerging positive organizational behavior two studies (N = 1, 032 and N = 232) test hypotheses on the impact that the selected positive psychological resource capacities of hope, optimism, and resilience have on desired work-related employee outcomes. These outcomes include performance (self-reported in Study I and organizational performance appraisals in Study 2), job satisfaction, work happiness, and organizational commitment. The findings generally support that employees' positive psychological resource capacities relate to, and contribute unique variance to, the outcomes.

"The authors explored the validity of two perspectives as to how managers evaluate subordinates who resist downward influence attempts: a uniformly dysfunctional perspective (i.e., managers regard all manifestations of resistance as indicators of ineffective influence and rate subordinates unfavorably when they resist) and a multifunctional perspective (i.e., managers regard some manifestations of resistance as more constructive than others and rate subordinates more favorably when they employ constructive resistance tactics). The results of two studies provided support for an interactive model, which predicts that the uniformly dysfunctional perspective is characteristic of lower quality, leader-member exchange (LMX) relationships and that the multifunctional perspective is characteristic of higher quality leader-member exchanges.","['resistance behavior', 'leader-member exchange', 'downward influence', 'performance evaluations', 'LEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'INFLUENCE TACTICS', 'PERCEIVED EFFECTIVENESS', 'MODERATORS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'CONFLICT', 'PURSUIT']","['leader member exchange', 'downward influence', 'leader member exchange']","['constructive resistance tactics', 'leader member']",0.0,0.0
"An increasing number of firms are hosting virtual customer environments (VCEs) to involve their customers in product development and product support activities. While the benefits to companies from hosting such VCEs are clear, another closely related issue has received far less attention: Why do customers participate voluntarily in value cocreation (here, product support) activities in such virtual customer environments? This study seeks to answer this question by developing and testing a conceptual model that draws on the uses and gratifications approach to consider an integrated set of four benefits that customers gain from their interactions in VCEs. The research model also incorporates the interaction-based antecedents of these customer benefits. Drawing on concepts and insights from the areas of computer-mediated communication and brand communities, the key characteristics of customers' interactions in the VCE are identified and related to the aforementioned four types of benefits. The study hypotheses are tested using data collected from customer participants of the VCEs of two firms, Microsoft and IBM. The dependent variable, customers' actual participation in the VCE, is operationalized as a time-lagged variable, and the data for this are sourced from the Netscan database. Results offer strong support for the model and indicate that customers' participation in product support activities in a VCE is motivated not just by their citizenship'' or norm-related behavior but stems primarily from their beliefs concerning the benefits of engaging in such activities. Results also show the impact of key interaction characteristics of VCEs on such perceived benefits and imply the need for firms to carefully design their VCEs to enhance customers' perceptions regarding potential benefits. The research model and the findings hold important implications for research and practice in customer coinnovation and product development. The model provides the basis for identifying the appropriate set of VCE design features. Companies can test the efficacy of their VCE design features by focusing on how such features augment the four types of benefits discussed and thereby ensure continued customer participation. The study findings also hold broader implications for practice in the customer relationship management area, particularly with regard to the potential to combine customers' VCE interactions with appropriate offline product-related activities and to view the VCE as an integral element of the firm's overall customer relationship management initiative.","['nan', 'SOCIAL-INFLUENCE', 'COMMUNITIES', 'INTERNET', 'ONLINE', 'COMMUNICATION', 'INNOVATION', 'GRATIFICATIONS', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'DEVELOPERS', 'CONSUMERS']","['communities', 'communication', 'innovation', 'gratifications']","['customer environments', 'value cocreation']",0.0,0.0
"The attraction of blue-chip listings in emerging stock markets is a major policy initiative common across much of the developing world. In many cases however, local blue-chip firms are the result of foreign Multinational Enterprise (MNE) firms engaging with local indigenous partners to form an international joint venture (IJV). These are unique with bilateral governance structures underscoring co-ownership between partners of residual cash flows and assets of the IJV. Using a unique and comprehensive sample of 202 IPO firms from across the emerging African region evidence of both a pronounced internal as well as external role for IJV boards was found. Social and political legitimacy concerns dominate the external role of boards in particular. Increasing proportions of boards drawn from commercial and governmental social elites are associated with IJV IPO firms in high institutional quality while lower proportions of these elites are associated with civil code law jurisdictions rather than common law. Governmental elites are associated with country-level improvements in corruption control and political stability while commercial elites are only marginally associated with improvements in political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law and democratic voice and accountability measures.

"This paper takes a macroperspective of entrepreneurship, and focuses on the issues and events involved in constructing an industrial infrastructure that facilitates and constrains entrepreneurship. This infrastructure includes: (1) institutional arrangements to legitimate, regulate, and standardize a new technology, (2) public resource endowments of basic scientific knowledge, financing mechanisms, and a pool of competent labor, as well as (3) proprietary R&D, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution functions by private entrepreneurial firms to commercialize the innovation for profit. Although extensive research substantiates the importance of these infrastructure components, they have been treated as externalities to entrepreneurship. By incorporating these components within a single framework, one can systematically examine how various actors and functions interact to facilitate and constrain entrepreneurship. The paper makes three contributions to understanding entrepreneurship. First, I believe that the study of entrepreneurship is deficient if it focuses exclusively on the characteristics and behaviors of individual entrepreneurs, on the one hand, and if it treats the social, economic, and political factors influencing entrepreneurship as external demographic statistics, on the other hand. Popular folklore notwithstanding, the process of entrepreneurship is a collective achievement requiring key roles from numerous entrepreneurs in both the public and private sectors. Second, the paper examines how and why this infrastructure for entrepreneurship emerges. I argue that while this infrastructure facilitates and constrains individual entrepreneurs, it is the latter who construct and change the industrial infrastructure. This infrastructure does not emerge and change all at once by the actions of one or even a few key entrepreneurs. Instead, it emerges through the accretion of numerous institutional, resource, and proprietary events that co-produce each other over an extended period. Moreover, the very institutional arrangements and resource endowments created to facilitate industry emergence can become inertial forces that hinder subsequent technological development and adaptation by proprietary firms. This generative process has a dynamic history that is itself important to study systematically if one is to understand how novel forms of technologies, organizations, and institutions emerge. Finally, the paper emphasizes that the process of entrepreneurship is not limited to the for-profit sector; numerous entrepreneurial actors in the public and not-for-profit sectors play crucial roles. It motivates one to examine the different roles played by these actors, and how their joint contributions interact to develop and commercialize a new technology. This in turn makes it possible to understand how the risk, time, and cost to an individual entrepreneur are significantly influenced by developments in the overall infrastructure for entrepreneurship. It also explains why the entrepreneurs who run in packs will be more successful than those that go it alone to develop their innovations.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL MORTALITY', 'INNOVATION', 'PERSPECTIVES', 'ADOLESCENCE', 'POPULATION', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'DYNAMICS', 'NEWNESS']","['innovation', 'technology']",[],0,0.0
"Theory predicts that market and resource orientations can each lead to innovation and financial success. Despite this, no research has examined whether the pursuit of both resource and market orientations is feasible and, if so, the impact of this combined effect on innovative and financial outcomes. This paper aims to address these gaps. Thus, it is the first to examine the interdependent relationship between market orientation (MO) and resource orientation (RO). Additionally, this study responds to calls for (1) cross-disciplinary research, particularly in the areas of marketing and strategic management, and (2) comparative studies of diverse strategic orientations on performance. In doing so, this paper investigates the difference in innovation performance and financial performance between firms adopting a high or low degree of market orientation or a high or low degree of resource orientation. This allows us to observe independent and interdependent effects of these orientations on the firm's performance. Data were collected from 250 senior executives in Australia. Confirmatory factor analysis and related techniques were applied to assess the robustness of the measures used. A two-way between-groups analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the relationships. Results show the emergence of four organizational types: unfocused imitators or followers; market-driven innovators; masters of innovation; and financial champions. From these, financial champions emerge as having the greatest impact on the financial performance of the firm, while masters of innovation are best for maximizing innovation outcomes. In fact, organizations with a high RO in the matrix (masters of innovation and financial champions) achieved a higher impact on innovation relative to the quadrants reflecting a lower MO. Results also demonstrate that pursuing a low degree of resource and market orientations leads to inferior financial performance. Therefore, a balance of resource and market orientations is important. A potential extension of this research is to assess these relationships on an industry-by-industry basis. This would contribute to our knowledge by allowing us to determine if and how these results differ between industries. Managerial and theoretical implications are also discussed.","['nan', 'RESOURCE-BASED THEORY', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'PRODUCT PERFORMANCE', 'FIRM', 'CAPABILITIES']","['market orientation', 'firm']",[],0,0.0
"In spite of the growing interest in sustainable advantages, there has been little effort by strategy researchers to investigate market dominance. In this paper, the extent of dominance by leading firms is linked to the ability to develop and exploit their reputation as a key resource. Results from a wide spectrum of consumer product markets indicate that the advantages that stem from reputation are typically tied to specific industry characteristics. In particular, dominance is more likely to be observed in industries that offer consumer products that are purchased frequently and have lower prices.

The recent waning of scholarly interest in this type of resistance, however, also points to the contemporary relevance of Willmott's analysis.

"Prior literature stresses the importance for manufacturers to use formal and informal controls to coordinate collaborative new product development activities with suppliers. In doing so, the existence of trust between manufacturers and suppliers is believed to play a key role because it enables manufacturers to reduce investments in formal controls and rely more on less costly informal controls. Manufacturers and suppliers don't suddenly trust each other though: trust typically grows over time as the partners get to know each other. Trust may also decrease if manufacturers overuse formal controls or if suppliers underperform. These fluctuations in trust over the course of supplier-manufacturer relationships complicate the so-called trust-control nexus and raise important questions about the impact of trust on the efficiency and effectiveness of formal and informal controls as coordination mechanisms. Therefore, this study examines how manufacturers should balance formal and informal controls over time to reap the full benefits of collaborative product development with suppliers. For that purpose, a conceptual and system dynamics model are developed, which incorporate the links among formal and informal controls, trust, and the supplier's development performance. In an empirical validation in the context of the shipbuilding industry, the results reject the notion that manufacturers must lessen formal controls and increase informal controls with trust. Instead, it is most efficient and effective to invest always in formal controls, particularly process control, to coordinate supplier involvement in new product development. These results have important theoretical and managerial implications: Informal controls are not as profitable as expected.","['nan', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'APPROPRIATION CONCERNS', 'MANAGEMENT CONTROL', 'FORMAL CONTRACTS', 'UNITED-STATES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'COOPERATION', 'COORDINATION', 'INTEGRATION']","['performance', 'coordination']",['development'],0.0,0.0
"Studies have demonstrated the importance of scientific research for innovation and economic performance at the firm and regional levels, and policymakers have extensively supported the commercialization of public science. However, we still lack theoretical and empirical evidence on the link between the commercialization of public science and broader societal impacts. Specifically, despite a large body of evidence on the determinants of science commercialization, mainly addressed in the literature on academic entrepreneurship, the consequences of such activities remain less explored. In this article, we seek to fill this void by viewing science commercialization as a means rather than as a final outcome. Instead of mapping the direct outcomes of the science commercialization process, mostly achieved through entrepreneurial activities, we see science commercialization as an enabler of broader societal impacts. This article outlines a research agenda on the societal impacts of science commercialization by extending current theories, data, and methods and exploring the need to consider ethical concerns and who is benefiting from these impacts.","['nan', 'UNIVERSITY-INDUSTRY COLLABORATION', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'SPIN-OFF COMPANIES', 'BAYH-DOLE ACT', 'TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER', 'ACADEMIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'HIGHER-EDUCATION', 'US UNIVERSITIES', 'UNITED-STATES', 'START-UPS']",['academic entrepreneurship'],"['innovation', 'public science', 'entrepreneurship']",0.0,0.0

"Marketing organization is the interface of the firm with its markets and where the work of marketing gets done. This review of the past 25 years of scholarship on marketing organization examines the individual and integrative roles of four elements of marketing organization-capabilities, configuration (including structure, metrics, and incentives), culture, and the human capital of marketing leadership and talent. The authors indicate that these four elements are mobilized through seven marketing activities (7As) that occur during the marketing strategy process. These activities enable the firm to anticipate market changes, adapt the strategy to stay ahead of competition, align the organization to the strategy and market, activate effective implementation, ensure accountability for results, attract resources, and manage marketing assets. How well the firm manages these seven activities throughout the marketing strategy process determines the performance payoffs from marketing organization. Future research priorities outlined for the elements of marketing organization, their integration, and their impact on the 7As offer directions for the study of organizing for marketing excellence.","['marketing organization', 'capabilities', 'structure', 'culture', 'marketing leaders', 'marketing talent', 'marketing metrics', 'marketing strategy', 'firm performance', 'SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT', 'WORD-OF-MOUTH', 'CONTACT SERVICE EMPLOYEES', 'TRANSACTION COST-ANALYSIS', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITIES', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE']","['marketing organization', 'capabilities', 'structure', 'culture', 'marketing leaders', 'marketing strategy']","['marketing organization', 'marketing strategy']",1.0,0.3333333333333333
"The marketing-manufacturing interface is important to the success of product development. This research investigates the effect of senior management policies on the effectiveness of the marketing-manufacturing interface. Based on existing literature, a conceptual framework is developed that relates senior management policies, marketing-manufacturing involvement, and new product performance. The proposed framework is contingent on the national culture of the country in which product development occurs. Structural equation modeling is used to test the framework with data from a sample of 146 U.S. marketing managers and 185 Japanese marketing managers. The results suggest that a number of senior management policies are effective in promoting joint involvement between the marketing and manufacturing functions during the innovation process. While the use of formal cross-functional integration policies was found to promote marketing-manufacturing involvement both in the United States and Japan, team leader autonomy, team rewards, and job rotation were found to promote marketing involvement in the United States but not in Japan. On the other hand, promoting marketing-manufacturing involvement via goal clarity and promotion of teamwork proved to be effective in Japan. The results have a number of implications for product development practice. Foremost among these is the finding that, despite the fundamental ideological differences separating the marketing and manufacturing functions, senior management policies can enhance the level of marketing-manufacturing involvement, and consequently can improve the likelihood of new product success. The second implication is that the effectiveness of specific senior management policies depends on national culture. Thus, managers wishing to improve the marketing-manufacturing interface should select the policies that match the culture in which the product development project is located.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAMS', 'FUNCTIONAL COOPERATION', 'PROJECT PERFORMANCE', 'INTERFACE', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DETERMINANTS', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'JAPANESE', 'INTEGRATION']","['interface', 'japanese', 'integration']","['performance', 'national culture', 'japanese', 'innovation', 'united']",0.2,0.3333333333333333

This dynamic model brings the importance of the products themselves, supported by vertical chains of activities, into the analysis of resource and knowledge-based competitive advantage.

"This paper aims to deepen the understanding about when and how the mobilization of resources through strong and weak ties in a focal firm's network can affect new product success. It addresses two significant gaps in the literature. While prior research has advanced the understanding of how factors around tie strength, resource mobilization, and environmental characteristics relate to new product development, it has yet to offer a more holistic understanding of the interconnected structures and the interplay among these factors. Furthermore, limited insights exist about how firms could utilize resource mobilization approaches in different environmental contexts to enhance new product success. Building on resource dependence theory, this paper contributes to prior work by adopting configuration theoretical considerations and performing an empirical investigation to identify necessary and sufficient conditions for new product success. Based on data from a survey of 354 managers from manufacturing and services firms in the United Kingdom, the study conducts a configurational comparative study based on fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to examine configurations of strong-tie and weak-tie resource mobilization approaches within particular environmental contexts for new product success. The findings reveal alternative, equifinal configurations for new product success, and add to the existing body of work by connecting the notions of network ties, resource mobilization, and context dependence, as well as by developing an integrative framework to explain the interplay of remote and proximate conditions for new product success. For management practice, this study offers guidance in describing and diagnosing business contexts that enhance new product success, and in identifying resource mobilization action repertoires to capitalize on these contexts.","['nan', 'OPEN INNOVATION', 'STRONG TIES', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CONFIGURATIONS', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'NETWORK STRUCTURE', 'STRUCTURAL HOLES', 'BRIDGING TIES', 'WEAK TIES', 'PERFORMANCE']",['weak ties'],"['resource dependence', 'qualitative comparative analysis']",0.0,0.0
"This study examines the interplay of product development strategy, knowledge utilization, and product innovation performance in the context of Chinese subsidiaries of multinational companies. When firms strive to develop highly innovative products (breakthrough focus), the amount of resources allocated has a U-shaped relationship to subsequent product innovation performance (i.e., market rewards of new products). When the aim of product development activity is to reinforce and maintain moderately innovative products (platform focus), increased resource allocation shows a positive relationship to product innovation performance. The amount of resources allocated to minor revisions (incremental focus) shows no significant relationship to product innovation performance. Knowledge utilization is an important predictor of the benefits of developing highly and moderately innovative products.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the role of procurement in identifying and managing the intra-and inter-organisational issues which impact supply chain resilience. Achieving resilience along the supply chain in today's turbulent business environment requires efforts from both internal and external elements of the extended enterprise. Design/methodology/approach - The systematic literature review was conducted between 2000 and 2013 with the objective being to answer the single research question proposed. To do so, a content analysis based on the literature was applied to 30 selected papers. Findings - The study revealed that procurement activities do make a significant contribution to creating supply chain resilience. Emerging from the literature review, certain intra-and inter-organisational issues were identified that could impact supply chain resilience. Also the possible actions that procurement could take to enable the enhancement of supply chain resilience were identified. Research limitations/implications - This study is limited, in that it is exploratory and focuses only on the body of knowledge presented in two databases over the past 13 years. It has also been restricted to the procurement function and the consequent implications for the upstream supply chain. Originality/value - The originality of this paper lies in the identification of intra-and inter-organisational issues from a procurement perspective specifically as they relate to improving supply chain resilience. This raises further questions on the role of procurement in creating supply chain resilience, which has not been well-explored in the current literature.","['Procurement', 'Supply chain resilience', 'Systematic literature review', 'Disruptions', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PERSPECTIVES', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'FLEXIBILITY', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'DISRUPTIONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'INTEGRATION']","['procurement', 'supply chain resilience', 'systematic literature review', 'environment']","['procurement', 'systematic literature review', 'supply chain resilience']",1.0,0.75
"The technology-sourcing decision traditionally has examined the choice either to innovate internally or to acquire technology from outside sources. The increasing complexity of this decision requires a move beyond the simple make-versus-buy dichotomy. We seek to test factors that influence the technology decision of subsidiaries for product and process technology across the continuum of options from internal development to outsourcing. We also explore concordance between the research streams of new product development and technology sourcing. Regression models are used to analyze data from 187 subsidiaries that suggest product and process technology development decisions sometimes are associated with similar factors and at other times they diverge. In particular, we find that external product and process technology acquisition decisions are associated negatively with differentiation goals and associated positively with product dynamism. While external product acquisition is associated negatively with a low cost goal and positively with increasing distance between primary marketing and R&D operations, external process technology acquisition is associated positively with high competitive intensity. Implications include the following: (1) While external product technology acquisition may provide quicker or even less expensive initial solutions, external reliance makes it difficult to maintain a long-term positional advantage; (2) When greater distances separate key functional activities, external partners may provide solutions that are more responsive to local consumer needs, and the potential for improved communication may allow for quicker adaptation and increased flexibility; (3) In highly dynamic product situations, internal development, while providing greater control, can be expensive and can result in technologies that are not accepted by the marketplace; and (4) As competitive intensity increases, strategic imperatives may reduce the focus on product design and development and may require increasing concentration on manufacturing costs and efficiencies.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'SIGNIFICANT ISSUES', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'COMMUNICATION', 'PATTERNS', 'FUTURE', 'FIRM']",['communication'],[],0,0.0
"The role of product quality in industries influenced by network effects has been the subject of significant debate among management theorists. Some have suggested that network effects can result in inferior products, as consumers value a large cohort of fellow adopters over the technical quality of a given product. Others argue that cases of market domination by inferior products are quite rare and that product quality is an important aspect of network-based competition. Thus, a fundamental question has arisen from this debate: in industries influenced by network effects, does product quality matter? This research uses a sample of product releases in the application software industry from 1986 to 1998 to test the impact of product quality on installed base growth for a given product line. Using software quality measures from archival trade publication reviews, quality is found to have a positive and significant impact on growth, even after controlling for installed base size and other product, firm, and segment characteristics. This finding suggests that the first-mover advantages often ascribed to network industries may be more complex than previously thought. Rather, effective strategy in network competition appears to center on the trade-off between early product releases, with the intent of establishing an early installed base, and later product releases, with the intent of improving the quality of the focal product. Several potential extensions of this work are offered, with a specific focus on (1) the impact of variation in the strength of network effects across industries, and (2) the dueling incentives faced by incumbents in network industries, who may possess greater capabilities to produce high-quality products but limited incentive to do so. Other potential contributions for theory and practice are offered and discussed.","['nan', 'TECHNOLOGY SUCCESS', 'LOCK-IN', 'INNOVATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETITION', 'STRATEGIES', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'FAILURE', 'FIRM']","['competition', 'firm']",['network effects'],0.0,0.0

"We build on the literature on categorization to develop and test a model of input-level spillover effects. Our model predicts that, when one firm suffers an accident with a particular input, investors will punish other users of that input by discounting their stocks, and that the magnitude of this negative spillover can be predicted by the nonresponsible firm's level of input usage. We also hypothesize that the magnitude of the punishment will be moderated by intermediaries' assessments of the input: Ex ante regulatory sanctions on the input will amplify negative spillovers, while the presence of input-level associations will weaken these effects. Finally, we predict that similarity between the responsible and nonresponsible firm in terms of two peripheral attributes input portfolio and geographic location will amplify the negative effect of input usage. We find strong support for our predictions in an event study that examines the stock market valuations of 270 nonresponsible manufacturing firms triggered by 78 industrial accidents involving a toxic chemical. We highlight our study's theoretical and empirical contributions to the categorization and spillover literatures.","['nan', 'INDUSTRY', 'LEGITIMACY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MEDIA', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STANDARDS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'PENALTIES']",['media'],"['categorization', 'input usage']",0.0,0.0
"The role of human capital has received considerable attention in research on small and medium sized firms. However, much uncertainty remains as to how practices that enhance human resources (HR) affect the performance of small and medium sized firms, whether some practices have stronger effects than others, and which contingencies influence these effects. Relying on the framework proposed by Subramony (2009), we propose that small and medium sized firms need to implement HR practices that focus on enhancing skills, motivation, and empowerment. The results of our meta-analysis comprising 56 studies that focused on small and medium sized enterprises (SME) indicated that HR-enhancing practices are correlated with firm performance (r(c) = .228). Moreover, HR-enhancing practices were more relevant for young firms and SME operating in high-tech industries and in country contexts characterized by rigid labor regulations. We compare the results of this meta-analysis with meta-analyses performed in the large firm context. Overall, our results suggest that HR-enhancing practices are important in the SME context in general and, moreover, they specify whether or not these practices have to be adapted to the SME context.

"Buyers in retail chains typically plan promotional markdowns and accompanying advertising for the complete season, subject to budgetary and scheduling constraints. Because of the large number of possible alternatives and the difficulty of predicting the sales responses to novel plans, promotional plans are currently prepared through trial and error, by modifying previous years' plans. This paper proposes a methodology for developing an optimal promotional plan that maximizes total season profit, subject to promotional resource constraints and a set of possible market scenarios, by selecting from a discrete set of candidate ads and markdowns. The benefit of the optimization model is illustrated by applying it to promotional data from a major department store chain and comparing the results to plans previously implemented by the buyers.","['nan', 'SALES', 'PROMOTION', 'DEMAND']","['sales', 'promotion']",[],0,0.0

"Strategic alliances are an important source of resources, learning, and thereby competitive advantage. Few firms have all of the resources needed to compete effectively in the current dynamic landscape. Thus, firms seek access to the necessary resources through alliances. We examine the management of strategic alliances using the theoretical frames of transactions cost, social network theory and the resource-based view. Alliances must be effectively managed for their benefits to be realized. Effective alliance management begins with selecting the right partner Furthermore, alliances must be managed to build social capital and knowledge. TO maximize cooperation among the partners, a trust-based relationship must be developed. Therefore, we conclude that managing alliances is crucial for firms to gain competitive advantage and create value with strategic alliances. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

"It is surprising that, to date, a discussion of exiting fieldwork is absent from the management and organization literature an absence we believe is unjustified. We argue that analyzing exit from fieldwork is important for theorizing. We combine two streams of research ethnography in the broader social sciences and business marketing on dissolving relationships to propose a relational framework for conceptualizing and analyzing exit. The framework represents a first attempt to examine exiting in a systematic and nuanced manner, with the objective of understanding why and how breaking the silence about exiting fieldwork may advance theorizing. We develop a typology of four exit types leading to four different approaches to theorizing. We suggest that exit may bring about a new beginning in theorizing rather than closure and that it is not only high-quality relationships in the field but also those that are disruptive that may lead to interesting theorizing.","['nan', 'QUALITATIVE RESEARCH', 'THEORY CONSTRUCTION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'UNIVERSITY', 'REFLEXIVITY', 'RESEARCHER', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'DIMENSION', 'BUILD', 'TALES']",['management'],"['fieldwork', 'ethnography']",0.0,0.0
"This study examines the relationships among brand identity, brand image, and brand preference in the context of cyber (pure online) and offline-based extension (traditional brick-and-mortar to online) retail brands over time. We test a conceptual model with survey data gathered over three time periods. Our results show that offline-based extension brands have an advantage over cyber brands when it comes to translating a brand identity into a successful brand image, especially in the early Internet stages (i.e., introduction and elaboration stages). Offline-based extension brands gain positive spillover effects from their offline-based counterparts, but such effects take time, and are not evident in the early Internet stage. Both types of brands have to work hard in the introductory stage to create a successful brand image that manifests into consumer preference for the brand. With regards to Internet use, we found that cyber brands have a slight disadvantage when moving from the elaboration stage to the fortification stage.

"With data from a specialty apparel retailer, we present two studies that investigate the impact of an in-store boutique displaying merchandise of a new retail brand on overall performance of the parent stores in which the boutiques are placed, and on customer spending on merchandise offered by each of the two brands. Findings from the two studies generally support that the in-store boutique enhances three key store-level metrics: average customer transaction value per store visit; comparable sales growth from one year to the next; and customer conversion ratio. At the customer-level both studies show that average customer transaction value on merchandise offered by the new brand is negatively related to average customer transaction value on the parent brand, and vice versa. Furthermore, both studies reveal that the relationship between the perceived fit between the two brands and average customer transaction value on the parent brand increases at an increasing rate (positive main and quadratic effects of perceived fit), but that the impact of perceived fit on average customer transaction value on the in-store boutique brand increases at a deceasing rate (positive main effect, but a negative quadratic effect of perceived fit). Implications for retail practice and theory are offered. (C) 2012 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"This study investigates whether anti-dumping statutes are effective at improving the performance of U.S. firms. As international trade grows and competitors increasingly cross national borders to enter new markets, U.S. trade law becomes a potentially important tool for managers as they consider how to create barriers for foreign competitors, The results of this study suggest that the anti-dumping laws significantly increase returns of U.S. firms that pursue anti-dumping protection. The average petitioner between 1980 and 1992 received a $46 million increase in market value as a result of filing an anti-dumping petition. However, no significant change in market value was associated with preliminaty or final determinations of the international Trade Commission, except when petitions received a negative determination at the final stage of the process. A negative determination at the final stage of the process resulted in a loss of market value.

"Although scholars have established that customer satisfaction affects different dimensions of firm financial performance, a managerially important but overlooked aspect is its effect on a firm's future cost of selling (COS), that is, expenditures associated with persuading customers and providing convenience to them. Accordingly, this study presents the first empirical and theoretical examination of the impact of customer satisfaction on future COS. The authors propose that while higher customer satisfaction can lower future COS, the degree to which a firm realizes this benefit depends on its strategy and operating environment. Analyzing almost two decades of data from 128 firms, the authors find that customer satisfaction has a statistically and economically significant negative effect on future COS. While the negative effect of customer satisfaction on future COS is weaker for firms with higher capital intensity and financial leverage, this effect is stronger for more diversified firms and for firms operating in industries with higher growth and labor intensity. The authors also find that these effects may vary across two components of COS, cost of persuasion and convenience.","['capital structure', 'cost of selling', 'customer satisfaction', 'diversification', 'leverage', 'marketing-finance interface', 'strategic flexibility', 'strategic intent', 'SATISFIED CUSTOMERS', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'STOCK-MARKET', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'QUALITY', 'STRATEGIES', 'INDUSTRY', 'PRICE', 'DIVERSIFICATION']","['cost of selling', 'customer satisfaction', 'leverage', 'performance']","['customer satisfaction', 'performance']",1.0,0.5
"The extant literature has studied the effects of a firm's service recovery efforts on the reactions of customers and employees following an individual service failure. However, the impact of recovery efforts on a firm's performance after a public and large service failure-such as a large-scale information breach-has received scant attention. To address this gap, this current research develops a framework and finds support for the impact of service crisis recoveries on a firm's performance, as measured by firm-idiosyncratic risk. Using a unique dataset of service crisis recoveries, the authors find that firms offering compensation (i.e., tangible redresses) or process improvement (i.e., improvements in organizational processes) show more stable performance (less idiosyncratic risk), from two quarters to two calendar years after the announcement of their recovery plan. In line with the documented dual effect of apologies, firms that offer apology-based recoveries display more volatile performance (higher idiosyncratic risk). Of note, this volatility increases with the number of affected individuals, and it remains unaffected even when the apology is expressed with high intensity.","['Service crisis', 'Service crisis recovery', 'Firm risk', 'Shareholder value', 'Marketing-finance interface', 'Information breach', 'MARKET-BASED ASSETS', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'IDIOSYNCRATIC RISK', 'BRAND EQUITY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'EMPLOYEE', 'JUSTICE', 'IMPACT', 'EVENT']","['service crisis', 'information breach', 'idiosyncratic risk', 'employee', 'impact']","['service recovery', 'service failure', 'information', 'service crisis recoveries', 'idiosyncratic risk', 'compensation', 'apology']",0.14285714285714285,0.2
"The increased penetration of mobile devices has a significant impact on customers' online shopping behavior, with customers frequently switching between mobile and fixed devices on the path to purchase. By accounting for the attributes of the devices and the perceived risks related to each product category, the authors develop hypotheses regarding the relationship between device switching and conversion rates. They test the hypotheses by analyzing clickstream data from a large online retailer and apply propensity score matching to account for self-selection in device switching. They find that when customers switch from a more mobile device, such as a smartphone, to a less mobile device, such as a desktop, their conversion rate is significantly higher. This effect is larger when product category-related perceived risk is higher, when the product price is higher, and when the customer's experience with the product category and the online retailer is lower. The findings illustrate the importance of focusing on conversions across the combination of devices used by customers on their path to purchase. Focusing on the conversions on a single device in isolation, as is usually done in practice, significantly overestimates conversions attributed to fixed devices at the expense of those attributed to mobile devices.","['mobile', 'device switching', 'online conversion', 'cross-device', 'perceived risk', 'FIELD EXPERIMENT', 'MOBILE COMMERCE', 'CUSTOMERS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'FRAMEWORK', 'SHOPPERS', 'TABLETS', 'MODEL']","['mobile', 'device switching', 'perceived risk', 'customers', 'behavior']","['impact', 'online', 'device switching', 'conversion', 'product category related', 'risk']",0.16666666666666666,0.2
"Research summary User demand affects the emergence and growth of platform ecosystems through indirect network effects. But how do these effects play out in the strategies of platform providers and complementors as the ecosystem evolves? We study how user preferences for ecosystem innovativeness (complement novelty and quality) and ecosystem size (number of complementors/complements), and demand-based economies of scale, shape the strategic interactions between the platform provider and the complementors in the ecosystem. Using an analytical model, we identify the conditions that give rise to a trade-off between ecosystem innovativeness and size; when (and why) this trade-off generates a tension between value co-creation and appropriation among ecosystem participants; and the strategic implications for ecosystem competitiveness and for the different stages of the ecosystem's evolution. Managerial summary Managing complementors' incentives is critical for the success of a platform ecosystem. Such incentives may be offered not only for joining the platform, but also for contributing high-quality, innovative complements throughout the ecosystem's evolution. In this article, we show that demand-side economies of scale are the driving force of complementors' incentives, and hence the key success factor for platform strategies. The strength of user preferences ultimately determines whether a larger ecosystem can also be more innovative, in which case all ecosystem participants can gain; or if instead there is a trade-off between size and innovativeness, which could also lead to a tension between value co-creation and appropriation among the platform provider and its complementors. The different stages of the evolution of a platform ecosystem call for different strategies that adapt to the evolution of user preferences.","['ecosystem innovativeness', 'indirect network effects', 'platform ecosystems', 'platform evolution', 'user preferences', 'TRADE-OFFS', 'COMPETITION', 'MARKETS', 'SOFTWARE', 'IMPACT', 'DEVELOPERS']","['ecosystem innovativeness', 'indirect network effects', 'platform ecosystems', 'user preferences']","['platform ecosystems', 'value co creation', 'appropriation']",0.3333333333333333,0.25
"Through pleasure, a foundational concept in consumer behavior, we offer an analysis of the history, development, and experience of clubbing, the postcursor of rave and the contextual focus of this article. On the basis of a 5-year study primarily involving participant observation and interviewing, we present an analysis of how the clubbing experience is cocreated by promoters, DJs, and clubbers themselves. We develop and demonstrate a biosocial conceptualization of pleasure and show how the shared experience of music and dance, the organization of space, and the effects of the drug ecstasy combine to produce a highly sought-after, calculated suspension of the rules and norms of everyday life. Further, we suggest that the club, as well as the pleasurable practices and experiences that it supports, has become a site of contained illegality. Here, the illicit, subversive practices of rave have now become shepherded and channeled into more predictable, manageable, and regulated environments facilitated by the knowing wink of club promoters, police, and state authorities.

"Using ethnographic, experimental, and survey data from a handicraft cluster in southern India, this paper reports on a study of when and why people who identify with their work might sacrifice financial rewards in their economic decisions. Based on findings from ethnographic fieldwork, I hypothesize that the monetary value that individuals who identify with their work seek for their output depends on their audience: when they encounter discerning audiences, who are knowledgeable about and appreciative of their work, they underemphasize financial gains; transactions with non-discerning audiences, however, result in a focus on monetary rewards. I propose that the mechanism underlying this behavior is product attachment: people who identify with their work develop affection for the output of their labor and prefer to transact with audiences who will take care of their products beyond the point of sale, even if doing so results in lower monetary rewards. I substantiate this theory with a field experiment by demonstrating that handicraft artisans in India who identify with their work sell their products at different prices to discerning and non-discerning groups of buyers. This paper contributes to our understanding of economic decision making in the context of meaningful work by highlighting the moderating role of audiences and uncovering the mechanism of product attachment.","['markets', 'work', 'economic sociology', 'artisans', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-BEHAVIOR', 'PRODUCT ATTACHMENT', 'REINFORCEMENT', 'MOTIVATION', 'CALLINGS']","['work', 'artisans', 'product attachment']","['product attachment', 'affection', 'decision making']",0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
"Already on its introduction into the international business literature, the concept of 'psychic distance' implied asymmetry in the distance perceptions between country pairs, a characteristic corroborated in subsequent empirical studies. However, predominant empirical operationalizations and their theoretical underpinnings assume psychic distances to be symmetric. Building on insights from psychology and sociology, this paper demonstrates how national factors and cognitive processes interact in the formation of asymmetric distance perceptions. The results suggest that exposure to other countries through emigrants and imports of cultural goods and services have asymmetric effects on psychic distance perceptions. The size of these effects appears to vary with the size of the home country - smaller countries tend, on average, to perceive psychic distances to the rest of the world as smaller than do bigger ones. The reputational status of target countries relative to that of the home country is found to have a non-linear, asymmetric effect on distance perceptions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Research Summary The emerging practice of impact investing optimizes both financial and social outcomes, and thus promises to support hybrid organizations that simultaneously pursue financial and social goals. We argue, however, that impact investing decisions may be prone to behavioral factors that limit their outcome efficiency. In a portfolio allocation task designed to reflect the essential features of an impact investing decision, we find across a range of scenarios that individuals systematically fail to choose investment portfolios that achieve financial and social outcomes efficiently and thereby waste opportunities for value creation. We further show in online and in-person experiments that outcome inefficiency is related to categorical cognition: suppression of categorical labels on investment options increases efficiency. Managerial Summary The impact investing approach promises to encourage greater financial investments in hybrid organizations that pursue a combination of financial and social goals. We experimentally demonstrate a challenge of this approach: People struggle to identify portfolios of investments that simultaneously optimize across financial and social outcomes. This is partly due to categorical cognition: a natural tendency to view investments in terms of known categories rather than the actual outcomes they produce. Our experiments show that removing the labels for-profit company, charity, and social enterprise from investment options-thus making it more difficult to think about them categorically-increases outcome-efficient allocations. We therefore show that realizing the full potential of impact investing will require that investors transcend conventional thinking about business and charity as separate domains.","['behavioral economics', 'categorical cognition', 'hybrid organizations', 'impact investing', 'social enterprise', 'STAKEHOLDER THEORY', 'CATEGORIZATION', 'GOVERNANCE', 'DEMAND', 'MODEL']","['categorical cognition', 'hybrid organizations', 'impact investing', 'social enterprise']","['impact investing', 'hybrid organizations', 'portfolio allocation', 'creation', 'outcome inefficiency', 'cognition']",0.3333333333333333,0.5

"This article studies how workforce composition is related to a firm's success in introducing radical innovations. Previous studies have argued that teams composed of individuals with diverse backgrounds are able to perform more information processing and make deeper use of the information, which is important to accomplish complex tasks. We suggest that this argument can be extended to the level of the aggregate workforce of high-technology firms. In particular, we argue that ethnic and higher education diversity within the workforce is associated with superior performance in radical innovation. Using a sample of 3,888 Swedish firms, this article demonstrates that having greater workforce diversity in terms of both ethnic background and educational disciplinary background is positively correlated to the share of a firm's turnover generated by radical innovation. Having more external collaborations does, however, seem to reduce the importance of educational background diversity. The impact of ethnic diversity is not affected by external collaboration. These findings hold after using alternative measures of dependent and independent variables, alternative sample sizes, and alternative estimation techniques. The research findings presented in this article would seem to have immediate and important practical implications. They would suggest that companies may pursue recruitment policies inspired by greater ethnic and disciplinary diversity as a way to boost the innovativeness of the organization. From a managerial perspective, it may be concluded that workforce disciplinary diversity could be potentially replaced by more external links, while ethnic diversity could not.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'INTERNAL CAPABILITIES', 'KNOWLEDGE SOURCES', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TEAM', 'MOBILITY', 'SEARCH', 'CREATIVITY', 'DEMOGRAPHY']","['performance', 'team', 'search']",['radical innovations'],0.0,0.0
"The back-story of customer rage, that is, what is behind a rage episode, specifically the customer's cognitive appraisal processes that trigger extreme negative emotions, and the customer's background (culture) is not well understood.

Our two country research clearly shows that service failure types are differentially associated with different forms of cognitive appraisals (i.e., perceived threats to resources, self-esteem, justice, control, and physical well-being), irrespective of the customer's home country. However, US and Thai customers appear to place different relative importance on cognitive appraisal types.

"During professional service encounters, integrating customers into the process of service provision is both important and challenging, as the complexity of professional services can impair value creation at the service provider-customer interface. This study addresses this problem by examining how service complexity impacts customer cognitive capacity and finally important marketing outcomes. Through an examination of 310 interactions between service providers and customers of a retail bank, this study shows that customers' cognitive capacity is drastically reduced at moderate levels of perceived complexity. Subsequently, a lack of cognitive capacity decreases customer satisfaction with the encounter and loyalty intentions toward the company, two important drivers of company profitability. Results further show that service providers' ability to adapt to the specific nature of the encounter helps customers to conserve cognitive capacity. This study hence contributes to service literature by emphasizing the central role of perceived service complexity and establishing the importance of customers' cognitive capacity in professional service encounters. From a managerial perspective, this study underlines the importance of decreasing service complexity to avoid the negative consequences of mentally overtaxing customers and shows how service providers can effectively use adaptive selling to manage customers' cognitive capacity at the service provider-customer interface.","['professional services', 'customer cognitive capacity', 'service complexity', 'personal selling', 'sales encounter', 'multilevel modeling', 'adaptive selling', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'INFORMATION LOAD', 'SELF-CONTROL', 'LIMITED-RESOURCE', 'MENTAL FATIGUE', 'SALESPERSON', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LOYALTY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'DEPLETION']","['professional services', 'customer cognitive capacity', 'service complexity', 'adaptive selling', 'customer satisfaction', 'loyalty']","['professional service encounters', 'cognitive capacity', 'perceived complexity', 'customer satisfaction', 'loyalty', 'profitability', 'selling']",0.2857142857142857,0.3333333333333333
"We integrate insights from organization design, economic game theory, and social psychology to examine the role of prior resource allocation and communication in alleviating behavioral uncertainty arising in interunit coordination settings. We use the context of post-acquisition coordination, focusing on the extent to which routines created under one organizational architecture (i.e., interorganizational alliances) may transfer to another organizational architecture (i.e., internal divisional structures via acquisition of alliance partners). Using a randomized experimental design, we find that prior resource allocation decisions in the absence of prior communication lowers post-acquisition performance due to the development and transference of pre-acquisition stage routines that may be inappropriate post-acquisition. Post-acquisition performance is aided, however, by the formation of noncompetitive routines in the pre-acquisition stage in the presence of communication.

It adds to the literature by examining the influence of the parent business system in multinationals. Specifically, it addresses how the dominant institutions and established organizational structures and practices in the home country affect the extent and impact of reverse diffusion of employment practices. Drawing on fresh evidence from American-owned multinationals in the UK we argue that there is considerable potential for reverse diffusion to occur among this group of firms. However, we highlight a number of barriers to reverse diffusion that the American business system presents, demonstrating that these constrain both the prevalence and the impact of it in practice.","['nan', 'HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT', 'JAPANESE', 'UK']",['uk'],['firms'],0.0,0.0
"We examine the relative merits of state (SOE) and private (POE) ownership on firm invention output in emerging as well as developed economies. Firm SOE affords a vehicle by which governments throughout the world encourage risky investment in new technological paths. Yet, from a traditional agency-theoretical standpoint, SOEs are plagued by low-powered incentives and dysfunctional involvement (e.g., wasteful budgets and political meddling), which reduces SOE performance, relative to POEs. To examine this paradox, we build an extended agency model which, rather than overlooking agency cost drivers, entertains a more balanced view, in which these so-called agency liabilities in fact benefit SOEs, particularly in the sphere of inventions. We argue that, given relatively higher levels of managerial autonomy, SOEs may outperform POEs in some types of inventive output. We further propose that key boundary conditions operate to modify this base effect, in that contexts lacking political constraints - a condition found in most emerging economies - increase the risk of political meddling, reducing managerial autonomy so that any SOE inventive advantages wane significantly. We also hypothesize that this negative effect of weak institutions is attenuated in high invention productivity sectors. Empirically, we track the frequency, pioneerism, and impact of patent inventions of 521 SOEs and matched POEs for 16 years, across 43 countries and 22 industries. We find empirical support for our hypotheses based on a robust set of fixed-effects regression analyses, aided by a battery of checks to assess self-selection and omitted variable bias.","['state-owned enterprises', 'agency theory', 'managerial autonomy', 'emerging markets', 'invention performance', 'political constraints', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'INNOVATION STRATEGY', 'INDUSTRIAL-POLICY', 'PATENT CITATIONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INSTITUTIONS', 'OWNERSHIP', 'INCENTIVES', 'MARKET', 'IMPACT']","['managerial autonomy', 'political constraints', 'performance', 'institutions', 'ownership', 'incentives', 'impact']","['agency liabilities', 'political constraints']",0.5,0.14285714285714285
"Recent empirical findings concerning the performance effects of service business model innovation (servitization) and its interplay with product innovation are mixed. Using the lenses of the demand-based view on value creation and complementarity, the performance impact of two key service business models is examined: the product-oriented model and the customer-oriented model, implemented jointly with product innovation. Results indicate that the interplay between service business model innovation and product innovation results in long-term performance benefits coupled with a degree of short-term performance sacrifice. Service business model innovation in isolation from product innovation results in short-term profit gains but long-term knowledge loss and, thus, market performance decline. Our study suggests that firms need to look beyond the evidence on short-term effects in order to achieve superior performance in the long run.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'FIRM', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'STRATEGIES', 'APPROPRIABILITY', 'DEMAND', 'COMPLEMENTARITY', 'ORIENTATION', 'EXPLORATION']","['firm', 'demand', 'complementarity']",['knowledge'],0.0,0.0
"Although strategy formulation has received the lion's share of attention in strategic management research, strategy implementation is widely considered to provide the greatest challenges for top executives. Observers have cited the need for more research on implementation, and thought leaders have called for the use of interdisciplinary approaches. Thus, we explore strategy implementation from the perspective of relational capital and human capital resources (in which relationships are especially important) and the development, bundling, and deployment of these resources to create strategic capabilities. Our discussion of implementation is unique in that we explain how it can be improved when guided by service-dominant logic (SDL) from the marketing field. We show how the emphasis of SDL on the exchange of service (rather than transactional interactions) and the manifestations of a service perspective such as enduring relationships, collaboration, co-creation, open dialogue, trust, and status minimization can facilitate the bundling and deployment of human capital resources for effective strategy implementation. We explain how SDL can facilitate implementation in the context of interdependencies, business ecosystems, and interactions across organizational boundaries. We provide both propositions and suggestions for future research.","['nan', 'MIDDLE MANAGEMENT INVOLVEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE WORK SYSTEMS', 'DOMINANT LOGIC', 'COMBINATIVE CAPABILITIES', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'VALUE CREATION', 'BUSINESS', 'CUSTOMER', 'ORIENTATION', 'INNOVATION']","['dominant logic', 'business']","['strategy implementation', 'human capital resources', 'strategic capabilities', 'service dominant logic']",0.0,0.0
"Research summary: Using a unique database that measures firm-level bribery in Africa and Latin America, we corroborate extant results in the literature that paying bribes deters firm investments in fixed assets. Our contribution is to explore four mechanisms. By adopting a reverse causality approach (Gelman and Imbens, 2013), we find evidence consistent with one of them: short-term oriented firms prefer to bribe rather than invest in fixed assets, while the opposite is true for firms with a long-term orientation. We rule out that bribe payments drain financial resources for investment, that firms that invest do not bribe because fixed assets make them less flexible and more vulnerable to future bribes, and that less efficient firms bribe rather than invest.Managerial summary: We ask whether, along with ethical issues, bribing affects the behavior and performance of firms in Africa and Latin America. Our statistical analysis shows that bribe payments do not reduce the short-term performance of firms, but frustrate investments in fixed assets, which is the foundation of firms' long-term growth. It is like seeking a job via nepotism or education. Nepotism makes it likely to find a job in the short term. However, the solid skills generated by education raise the odds of finding better jobs in the future. We rule out some common explanations for the trade-off between bribing and investment (e.g., bribes drain resources to invest or that less efficient firms bribe and do not invest). Our analysis suggests that firms with short-term orientations are more likely to bribe and firms with long-term orientation are more likely to invest.

"Building on institutional and transaction cost economics, this article proposes that legal enforceability increases the use of contract over relational reliability (e. g., beliefs that the other party acts in a non-opportunistic manner) to safeguard market exchanges characterized by non-trivial hazards. The results of 399 buyer-supplier exchanges in China show that: (1) when managers perceive that the legal system can protect their firm's interests, they tend to use explicit contracts rather than relational reliability to safeguard transactions involving risks (i.e., asset specificity, environmental uncertainty, and behavioral uncertainty); and (2) when managers do not perceive the legal system as credible, they are less likely to use contracts, and instead rely on relational reliability to safeguard transactions associated with specialized assets and environmental uncertainty, but not those involving behavioral uncertainty. We further find that legal enforceability does not moderate the effect of relational reliability on contracts, but does weaken the effect of contracts on relational reliability. These results endorse the importance of prior experience (e. g., relational reliability) in supporting the use of explicit contracts, and alternatively suggest that, under conditions of greater legal enforceability, the contract signals less regarding one's intention to be trustworthy but more about the efficacy of sanctions.

"Consumers frequently engage in sequential decisions. This article explores whether the order of these decisions can influence the manner in which consumers search through the possible choice options. Results from five studies suggest that ordering decisions by increasing (vs. decreasing) choice-set size leads to greater search depth (measured by both sampling count and decision time). Initial, smaller choice sets in increasing sequences appear to initiate a maximizing mind-set, which then persists even as participants encounter later, larger choice sets. These participants report a greater desire to maximize and are less satisfied with their decisions, consistent with research on chronic maximizers. In addition, they continue to exhibit maximizing behavior in subsequent, unrelated tasks, supporting a mind-set account of the differences in search. In sum, decision makers are proposed to be sticky adapters: initial decision strategies seem to constrain the extent to which they adapt to new contexts.","['nan', 'PREFERENCE CONSTRUCTION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'CONTEXT', 'SELF', 'TOO']","['behavior', 'context']",[],0,0.0
"Building on regulatory focus theory and the theory of action phases, we propose that the opportunity seeking of the entrepreneurial mindset is fueled by promotion focus, but transformed from something that liberates individuals from sub-optimal goals into something that traps them in escalation scenarios depending on the stability of environmental conditions faced, the duration of the project, and the specificity of the goal being pursued. Our meta-theoretical process model of escalation of commitment suggests that the decision to persist is set into motion long before individuals engage in the cost-benefit analysis examined in most escalation studies. We argue that, when individuals seek opportunities in a promotion-focused state of goal striving, they are likely to forego contingency planning, which precludes the formation of an exit strategy and leaves them unable to disengage despite an emerging desire to do so. Worse yet, opportunity seeking under the aforementioned conditions delays detection of an action crisis, which increases risk exposure and allows resources, time, and reputation invested to further accumulate, making disengagement that much more difficult once the entrepreneur realizes that a decision is necessary. Using the events of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster made famous by Jon Krakauer's Into Thiri Air, we illustrate our proposed model and discuss its implications for entrepreneurship, escalation, and self-regulation research.

"Intense emotions such as frustration, anger, and dissatisfaction often drive employees to speak up. Yet the very emotions that spur employees to express voice may compromise their ability to do so constructively, preventing managers from reacting favorably. I propose that to speak up frequently and constructively, employees need knowledge about effective strategies for managing emotions. Building on theories of emotion regulation, I develop a theoretical model that explains the role of managing emotions in the incidence and outcomes of voice. In a field study at a health care company, emotion regulation knowledge (1) predicted more frequent voice, (2) mediated by the emotional labor strategies of deep acting and surface acting, and (3) enhanced the contributions of voice to performance evaluations. These results did not generalize to helping behaviors, demonstrating that emotion regulation uniquely affects challenging but not affiliative interpersonal citizenship behaviors. This research introduces emotion regulation as a novel influence on voice and its consequences.","['nan', 'EXTRA-ROLE BEHAVIORS', 'IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT', 'PROACTIVE PERSONALITY', 'SOCIAL-STATUS', 'INTELLIGENCE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL', 'LABOR', 'JOB', 'PERCEPTIONS']","['performance', 'model', 'labor']","['emotions', 'emotional labor strategies', 'consequences']",0.0,0.0
"Impulse buying by consumers has received considerable attention in consumer research. The phenomenon is interesting because it is not only prompted by a variety of internal psychological factors but also influenced by external, market-related stimuli. The meta-analysis reported in this article integrates findings from 231 samples and more than 75,000 consumers to extend understanding of the relationship between impulse buying and its determinants, associated with several internal and external factors. Traits (e.g., sensation-seeking, impulse buying tendency), motives (e.g., utilitarian, hedonic), consumer resources (e.g., time, money), and marketing stimuli emerge as key triggers of impulse buying. Consumers' self-control and mood states mediate and explain the affective and cognitive psychological processes associated with impulse buying. By establishing these pathways and processes, this study helps clarify factors contributing to impulse buying and the role of factors in resisting such impulses. It also explains the inconsistent findings in prior research by highlighting the context-dependency of various determinants. Specifically, the results of a moderator analysis indicate that the impacts of many determinants depend on the consumption context (e.g., product's identity expression, price level in the industry).","['Meta-analysis', 'Impulse buying', 'Impulsivity', 'Self-control', 'Mood states', 'Marketing stimuli', 'SELF-CONTROL', 'VARIETY SEEKING', 'MODEL', 'ATMOSPHERICS', 'CONSUMPTION', 'PERSONALITY', 'IMPACT', 'SIMILARITIES', 'COEFFICIENTS', 'CONGRUENCY']","['meta analysis', 'impulse buying', 'self control', 'mood states', 'marketing stimuli', 'self control', 'consumption', 'impact']","['impulse buying', 'meta analysis', 'sensation seeking', 'self']",0.5,0.25
"Although leader-member exchange (LMX) was identified in the literature nearly 40 years ago, a comprehensive empirical examination of its antecedents and consequences has not been conducted. The authors' examination included 247 studies, containing 290 samples, and 21 antecedents and 16 consequences of LMX quality. Results indicated that while leader behaviors and perceptions, follower characteristics, interpersonal relationship characteristics, and contextual variables represent significant groups of LMX antecedents, leader variables explained the most variance in LMX quality. Moderator analyses revealed that the particular LMX scale, country of participants, and work setting studied did not produce meaningful influences on the relationships in the meta-analysis. However, power distance and individualism did moderate some of these relationships. To provide continuity with the LMX meta-analyses and conceptual reviews that have focused on LMX consequences, the authors tested a number of mediation models. The results demonstrated that LMX frequently plays a mediating role in the relationships where mediation could be tested.","['leader-member exchange', 'LMX', 'meta-analysis', 'leadership', 'VERTICAL DYAD LINKAGE', 'PERCEIVED ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT', 'FEEDBACK-SEEKING BEHAVIOR', 'SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY', 'SOCIAL-EXCHANGE', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'SUBORDINATE PERFORMANCE', 'NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY', 'MEDIATING ROLE']","['leader member exchange', 'lmx', 'meta analysis', 'mediating role']","['leader member exchange lmx', 'behaviors', 'perceptions', 'meta analysis', 'power distance', 'be tested']",0.16666666666666666,0.25
"In the context of price discounts, a special type of price promotion, in which savings depend on the outcome of a gamble and are thus uncertain, has recently achieved some popularity. The question arises as to whether such gambled price discounts (GPDs) incur the negative reference price effect-that is, a downward shift in customers' internal reference price (IRP)-which is often associated with regular price discounts (RPDs). From several studies, including two longitudinal field experiments, the authors find that GPDs indeed alleviate the negative reference price effect: IRPs and actual repurchasing tend to be lower for RPDs than for GPDs and a no-discount control condition. Moreover, the authors explore the psychological underpinnings of these effects and show that the different consequences of GPDs versus RPDs on IRPs are more pronounced if information regarding product quality is limited. The authors demonstrate that findings are robust to variations of GPD discount levels and the probability of winning.","['uncertainty', 'reference price', 'gambled price discounts', 'price promotion', 'marketing innovation', 'CONSUMER PRICE', 'ACCESSIBILITY-DIAGNOSTICITY', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'SEMANTIC CUES', 'BRAND CHOICE', 'PROMOTION', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'WILLINGNESS', 'UNCERTAINTY']","['reference price', 'gambled price discounts', 'price promotion', 'promotion']","['promotion', 'reference']",0.5,0.25
"We explore superstitious beliefs as a basis of product performance expectations and their impact on initial purchase likelihood and subsequent satisfaction. In doing so, we demonstrate instances when superstition-driven expectations cause consumers to make purchase decisions that run counter to economic rationality. In the first set of studies we find that Taiwanese consumers are relatively more likely to purchase a product with positive superstitious associations based on its lucky color, and are more likely to purchase and are willing to pay more money for a product with a smaller but lucky number of units contained in the package (e.g., eight tennis balls compared to ten). In contrast, consumers who do not hold such superstitious beliefs adhere to the more rational choice paradigm. Next, we show that the differences in purchase likelihood are driven by superstition-based performance expectations. We further generalize these findings to product satisfaction, and find support for expectation disconfirmation sensitivity as a moderator of the effect.","['Superstition', 'Consumer behavior', 'Irrational beliefs', 'Performance expectations', 'CONSUMER EVALUATIONS', 'SATISFACTION', 'QUALITY']","['superstition', 'performance expectations', 'satisfaction']",['product performance'],0.0,0.0

"Does related lending have positive or negative effects on the development of banking systems? We analyze a unique cross-country data set covering 74 countries from 1990 to 2007, and find that related lending, on average, does not have any effect on the growth of credit. We do find, however, that there are conditional relationships: related lending tends to retard the growth of banking systems when rule of law is weak, whereas it tends to promote the growth of banking systems when rule of law is strong. We also find that related lending appears to be associated with looting when banks are owned by non-financial firms, but that it does not do so when non-financial firms are owned by banks. Our results indicate that whether related lending is positive or pernicious depends critically on the institutional context in which it takes place; there is no single best policy regarding related lending.

"In countries with secure property rights, corporate transparency improves investment efficiency and increases growth by alleviating information asymmetry. However, in countries with insecure property rights, greater transparency can increase the risk of government expropriation. Therefore some firms that would benefit most from transparency cannot take full advantage of it, as they set sub-optimal transparency levels. Using data from 59 industries in 69 countries, we find that in countries with weak property rights protection, industries that would benefit the most from transparency exhibit worse investment efficiency and grow more slowly than industries that can efficiently operate at minimal levels of transparency.

"The purpose of the study was to investigate power structures and interactions among father-daughter and father-son family business decision teams experiencing management transfer. Analytic induction was the methodology used to test the family FIRO theory. Support was found for the theoretical premise of sequential and developmental relationships among the three dimensions (inclusion, control, and integration). The women in the father-son business experienced feelings of exclusion, incidents of higher conflict among family members, which produced less shared meaning, and lower levels of integration among family members. On the other hand, women in the father-daughter business experienced feelings of inclusion, resulting in lower conflict that created high levels of shared meaning, collaboration, and integration among family members. In management transfer consultations, if the entire family business decision team is not included in information gathering, and if the decision team is not observed interacting as a group, with individuals being allowed to confidentially confirm or refute the group interaction data, biased information may be obtained. For more successful adaptations in management transfers, power structures and interactions need to be reconstructed, failure to do so leads to confusion and conflict, resulting in distrust and lack of fellowship within the management decision team.","['nan', 'CONFLICT', 'FARM']",['conflict'],['power'],0.0,0.0

"Service innovation is a key source of competitive differentiation across firms and markets.

Process-based and output-based archetypes focus on value-adding phases and output value, respectively. Experiential and systemic archetypes have attracted less attention but become central for firms seeking to cocreate phenomenologically determined value within the service ecosystem. The article also contributes to service innovation research and practice by bringing together the existing archetypes, which were previously treated separately. Juxtaposing these archetypes and emphasizing value and value cocreation, the article proposes an integrative view of how novel value cocreation can be enhanced in service innovations.

"Three modes of resistance to persuasion (biased assimilation, relative weighting of attributes, and minimization of impact) were examined in the context of a longitudinal field study of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair and a lab experiment in the consumer setting. Only two of these modes (biased assimilation and relative weighting) were found to be sensitive to the refutability of the persuasive communication; the effectiveness of the remaining one (minimization of impact) was not influenced by this factor. Specifically, committed individuals demonstrated biased assimilation in the face of easy to refute negative information, but this mode of resistance decreased in its effectiveness when the information became difficult to refute. The relative-weighting mode of resistance (decreasing the weight given to attributes influenced by the negative information and increasing the weight given to favorably evaluated attributes), in contrast, emerged only in the face of difficult to refute information, apparently when biased assimilation decreased in its effectiveness. TI-le impact mode of resistance was fairly effective in the face of both easy and difficult to refute information.

Furthermore, when high levels of agency and stewardship governance coexist, family firm performance is the highest. Theoretical implications and future research directions are discussed.","['family firm performance', 'agency theory', 'stewardship theory', 'governance', 'organizational behavior', 'ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR', 'THEORETICAL INTEGRATION', 'DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS', 'EXPLORATORY EVIDENCE', 'CONCEPTUAL ISSUES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'BOARD']","['family firm performance', 'governance', 'performance']","['family firms', 'agency governance']",0.0,0.0
"The article develops a model of regret and tests it via four studies. Study 1 develops a multi-item measure of regret and distinguishes it from satisfaction. It also shows that, while satisfaction directly influences both repurchase and complaint intentions, regret directly influences only repurchase intentions, and its effect on complaint intentions is fully mediated via satisfaction. Study 2 examines the antecedents and moderators of regret. It shows that regret is experienced even in the absence of information on a better-forgone outcome. Furthermore, the moderating effect of three situation-specific characteristics (outcome valence, status quo preservation, and reversibility of the outcome) is examined. Studies 3 and 4 examine the cognitive process underlying the experiencing of regret in the absence of information on a better-forgone outcome. Generation of counterfactuals is identified as the cognitive mechanism that engenders regret. Results show that counterfactuals are most likely to be generated when the chosen outcome is negative and not the status quo.","['nan', 'POST-CHOICE VALUATION', 'COUNTERFACTUAL THINKING', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'RESPONSIBILITY', 'DETERMINANTS', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'EXPERIENCE', 'FEEDBACK']",['experience'],[],0,0.0
"Most EU countries differentiate not only applicable accounting standards between companies but also the filing requirements imposed on them. The main objective of allowing small and medium-sized entities (SMEs) to file abbreviated financial statements is to protect them from disclosing too much information to their competitors. However, so far there is a lack of empirical research on the costs and benefits of statutory filing requirements and the usefulness of available filing concessions. This article begins to explore these issues by analysing the compliance with statutory filing requirements as well as the take-up level of available filing concessions and revealed preferences for filing options of a large sample of Austrian GmbHs, suggestions that some medium-sized GmbHs expect net benefits from voluntary disclosures, whereas small GmbHs in general value costs arising from voluntary disclosures more highly than the benefits associated with them.","['Austria', 'cultural values', 'differential reporting', 'enforcement', 'filing practice', 'financial reporting', 'SMEs', 'VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE', 'CULTURAL-INFLUENCE', 'INFORMATION']","['austria', 'smes', 'voluntary disclosure', 'information']",['voluntary disclosures'],0.0,0.0
"Investor time horizon varies by company, industry and economic system. In this article we explore the importance of this variation by studying the impact of shareholder time horizon on the investment decisions of the firms they own, and externalities on the wider market. We demonstrate theoretically that short-term shareholders cause Boards to care about the path of the stock price, rationalising firms' pursuit of investments for signalling reasons at the expense of long-term value. We demonstrate that short-termism has spillover effects, leading to higher costs of equity capital; bubbles in the price of input assets; and predictable excess returns. We build testable cross-country hypotheses and evaluate these using existing evidence coupled with a new dataset on owner duration of US and Germanic firms.","['investor time-horizons', 'short-term shareholders', 'bubbles', 'cost of capital', 'short-termism', 'signalling', 'shareholder register', 'CORPORATE', 'COST', 'INFORMATION', 'GOVERNANCE', 'DISCLOSURE', 'HORIZONS', 'BUBBLES', 'MARKET']","['short term shareholders', 'bubbles', 'short termism', 'signalling', 'cost', 'bubbles', 'market']","['shareholders', 'short termism']",0.5,0.14285714285714285
"Researchers have analyzed various forms of extraordinary consumption experiences, using Victor Turner's conceptualization of antistructure with a particular focus on their rather romantic and communal aspects. While such a focus contributed greatly to our understanding of these experiences, it also resulted in overlooking much of their individuated characteristics such as boundaries, conflicts, competition, and positional struggles at the interpersonal level. This ethnographic study of commercialized climbing expeditions on Everest provides significant evidence that participants negotiate and manage various marketplace tensions within an individual performance ideology. Our study challenges quixotic use of Turner's antistructure-structure dichotomy and extends it such that extraordinary experiences, when bought in the marketplace, can be very individualistic and competitive as opposed to being conducive to feelings of community and liminal camaraderie.","['nan', 'CONSUMPTION', 'ETHNOGRAPHY', 'POSSESSIONS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'INQUIRY']",['consumption'],['consumption'],1.0,1.0
"As compared to developed countries, a much higher proportion of entrepreneurs within base-of-the-pyramid (BOP) markets operate unregistered businesses. Prior research has suggested that the primacy cause of such informal activity in these settings is the general failure of 'weak' institutions to provide sufficient resources to warrant formalization. We attempt to extend such thinking by deconstructing the discrete and inter-related effects of formal business registration on the level of resources obtained by entrepreneurs from financial, labor, and legal institutions within BOP markets. Using a multi-method approach involving 299 entrepreneurs within Guatemala City, our results suggest that being seen as a 'legitimate', registered business can actually lead to both increased resource provision and resource appropriation. More specifically, adhering to the norms and rules prescribed by regulatory institutions within weak legal environments can convey positive signals of stability and profitability that both attract the desired attention from formal institutional actors, as well as unwanted attention from criminals.

"Consumers often make decisions based on the extremeness of choice alternatives. Prior research has argued that extremeness aversion is a function of the relational properties of choice alternatives and that the middle option, defined such that its attribute values are between the values of the other alternatives, is always viewed as the least extreme, compromise option. The attribute-balance hypothesis advanced in this article extends prior research, demonstrating that extremeness aversion is also a function of the dispersion of attribute values within each alternative. In particular, it is argued that an option with equal attribute ratings will be perceived as the compromise alternative even when it is not the middle option. Data from three studies support this prediction, offering converging evidence for the attribute-balance effect in different decision contexts. Theoretical implications of the findings are discussed in the context of the extant extremeness aversion research.","['nan', 'COMPETITION', 'ATTRACTION', 'CONTEXT', 'SIMILARITY', 'FEATURES']",['context'],['aversion'],0.0,0.0
"Alleviating poverty in the least developed countries (LDCs) requires raising the income level of local workers. We look at the poor as producers and explore drivers of higher employee wages. We focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) because they are a major driver of employment growth and poverty alleviation in these countries. To pay higher wages, SMEs need to increase organizational efficiency. We argue that in LDCs, characterized by substantial formal institutional constraints, SMEs can improve efficiency either by internalizing inefficient formal institutions or by taking advantage of institutional enablers, established not only by local governments, but also by international, non-governmental, non-profit, or social enterprises set up around the world. In a sample of 1273 SMEs from seven LDCs across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, we find support for a mediated model, where SMEs with government contracts, higher exports, or female ownership achieve higher organizational efficiency, and in turn pay higher employee wages. The strongest mediation occurs for female-owned firms and the weakest for exporting firms, while the direct relationships to wages are strongest for exporting SMEs. The data support the idea that SMEs with a government contract are more efficient in transacting with other constituents in the business environment, those with higher exports have a broad base of efficiency sources, and those with female ownership are particularly adept at exploiting local business and societal relationships.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 5G connectivity have been identified as drivers of the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIR). AI and 5G, through emerging technologies such as blockchain, gene editing, Internet of Things sensors, nanotechnology, or 3D printing accelerate a blurring of boundaries between digital, biological, and physical spheres. In this editorial, we introduce the term boundary object, or boundary technology, that can help process more information (syntactic boundary) for enhanced learning (semantic boundary) and that can create a higher-level intelligence (pragmatic boundary). Boundary objects are also a means of representing, learning about, and transforming knowledge at a given boundary. We propose that crossing syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic boundaries is facilitated by three FIR phenomena (big data, machine learning, and AI). Each of these phenomena possesses a unique capability (processing, learning, and adaptation) to help communities learn about their differences and dependences. We also show how the six articles in this special issue are related to boundary and sphere challenges, and we provide an overview of directions for future research. All in all, marketing scholars should focus on enhancing their abilities in knowledge integration across boundaries to sustain their role as cutting-edge scientists.

"Research Summary We explore multinational strategy formation in the context of rising economic nationalism. Specifically, we examine how firms develop strategies to capitalize on the historical and aspirational attributes of national identity. Analyzing the histories of two German multinationals in late colonial India, we find that these firms engaged in geopolitical jockeying to delegitimize rival multinationals and position themselves as complementary to the economic and political goals of the host nation. Toward that end they employed aspirational political practices, addressing the inherently future-oriented character of nationalism, and invested in the development of political capabilities to gather information and shape perceptions of national contexts. The paper contributes to a more robust conceptualization of nations and nationalism and their role in the formation of international competition and strategy. Managerial Summary Rising economic nationalism can create political and economic opportunities as well as threats for multinational firms. Through a historical analysis of the emerging strategy of two German companies-Siemens and Bayer-in late colonial India, we show how firms can engage in geopolitical jockeying to delegitimize rival multinationals and position themselves as complementary to the economic and political goals of host nations. To do so the companies engaged in aspirational political practices, addressing the inherently future or goal-oriented aspects of nations, and created political capabilities designed to both gather intelligence on and shape the nationalist movements. The paper uses history as a mirror for reflecting on the causes and consequences of economic nationalism for international strategy in our own time.","['history', 'international strategy', 'multinational strategy', 'nationalism', 'nonmarket strategy', 'political capabilities', 'BRITISH BUSINESS', 'ORGANIZATION', 'GOVERNMENTS', 'STAKEHOLDER', 'LEGITIMACY', 'INVESTMENT', 'DELIBERATE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'EMERGENT', 'BARODA']","['history', 'international strategy', 'multinational strategy', 'nationalism', 'political capabilities']","['nationalism', 'national identity', 'india', 'capabilities']",0.25,0.2

Results suggest that the effect of PDB depends on the power held by the donor. In low-PDB contexts, people high (vs. low) in psychological power tend to be more self-focused (vs. other-focused), and this leads them to be less charitable.

"This paper examines whether inter-organizational factors influence German biotech firms' propensity to internationalize by forming international research alliances. Inter-organizational factors include dimensions of a firm's embeddedness within its local cluster and within its national research network. We test two sets of hypotheses (local and national network-drivers) on a longitudinal event history dataset of the complete German biotech population for the years 1995-2004. Findings show that location in a local cluster already dense with international linkages, the building of research alliances with local research institutes as well as national partners and central position in the national research network increase the probability of forming international research alliances.

"Research summary: Awards are a valuable strategic resource. Motivation theory and the emerging body of empirical literature suggest that awards can have a significant effect on employee motivation and corporate performance, though not always in the intended direction. Awards can also destroy value. The organizational award literature has so far largely neglected this important issue. We develop a synthesis of the dimensions critical for successful award bestowals, and analyze under which conditions awards generate firm-specific value that is sustained and difficult for competitors to imitate. The process of value creation and capture is contingent on the given firm's organizational characteristics and nature of production. The article concludes by laying out empirical implications. JEL codes: M52, M54, J24, J30.Managerial summary: Awards are widely used in the corporate sector. They fundamentally differ from monetary incentives, which risk crowding out employees' intrinsic motivation. Among the variety of awards, two general types can be distinguished: confirmatory awards based on explicit, pre-determined performance criteria, and discretionary awards, which rely on broad performance evaluations and may be used ex post to honor outstanding performance. Appropriately designed and adjusted to the specific firm's characteristics, awards enhance employees' motivation and corporate performance. They express recognition and support their recipients' perceived competence and social status. Awards help to retain valuable employees and to establish role models. However, awards may also backfire, for instance, when they provoke envy among coworkers. We propose when awards risk destroying value and when they are particularly useful.

"We elaborate theories of indigenous innovation by explaining how internationalization choices help emerging market firms transition from dependence on external knowledge to self-reliance on internal knowledge. Using a 1998-2007 census dataset of Chinese manufacturing firms, we theorize and test the moderation effect of foreign equity and export orientation on the relationship between knowledge and indigenous innovation. We show that foreign equity dis-incentivizes, while export orientation incentivizes, investments in internal knowledge. We contribute by showing that internationalization choices may radically change indigenous innovation outcomes by shifting the locus of problem solving outside or inside the firm. Our study corroborates the negative direct and indirect effects of external knowledge on indigenous innovation at the firm level previously suggested by China-centric scholars but also shows how two types of internationalization choices may gradually relieve firm-level dependence on imported technology. We bridge the gap between Western research and Chinese thought and practice by introducing a do-it-yourself (DIY) explanation of how firms may implement China's indigenous innovation (zizhu chuangxin) policy.

"When social and economic conditions change dramatically, status hierarchies in place for hundreds of years can crumble as marketization destabilizes once rigid boundaries. This study examines such changes in symbolic power through an ethnographic study of a village in North India. Marketization and accompanying privatization do not create an independent sphere where only money matters, but due to a mix of new socioeconomic motives, they produce new social obligations, contests, and solidarities. These findings call into question the emphasis in consumer research on top-down class emulation as an essential characteristic of status hierarchies. This study offers insights into sharing as a means of enacting and reshaping symbolic power within a status hierarchy. A new order based on markets and consumption is disrupting the old order based on caste. As the old moral order dissolves, so do the old status hierarchies, obligations, dispositions, and norms of sharing that held the village together for centuries. In the microcosm of these gains and losses, we may see something of the broader social and economic changes taking place throughout India and other industrializing countries.","['status', 'symbolic power', 'marketization', 'sharing', 'caste', 'CONSUMER CULTURE', 'CONSUMPTION', 'ESCAPE', 'FIELD']","['status', 'symbolic power', 'marketization', 'sharing', 'caste', 'consumption']",[],0,0.0

"Strategy scholars have argued that capabilities can influence firm performance through a variety of means and mechanisms. However, the role of capabilities and their proposed contributions have been narrowly theorized and insufficiently tested. We contribute to resolving these issues by considering the conditions under which ordinary and dynamic capabilities contribute to higher relative firm performance. We do so by examining the positive and negative contributions of capabilities to relative firm performance as well as the effects of environmental dynamism and the degree of capability heterogeneity. We utilize measures of relative firm performance at both the process and firm level within a sample of Chilean firms, which due to a dynamic environment allows for a clearer link between the environment and the use of capabilities. We find that environmental dynamism negatively affects the contribution of ordinary capabilities and positively affects the contribution of dynamic capabilities to relative firm performance. Further, heterogeneity strengthens the contribution of dynamic capabilities to relative firm performance, but is less important for ordinary capabilities. Interestingly, we find support for the direct effects of capabilities to be stronger with a process-level performance measure, whereas the influences of environmental dynamism and heterogeneity are stronger with a firm-level measure.

"Research Summary: In multivariate regression analyses of correlated variables, we sometimes observe pairs of estimated beta coefficients large in absolute magnitude and opposite in sign. T-statistics are also large, suggesting meaningful findings. I found 64 recently published Strategic Management Journal articles with results exhibiting these characteristics. In this article, I demonstrate that such results may be Type 1 errors (false positives): If regressors are correlated via an unobservable common factor, estimated beta coefficients will misleadingly tend toward infinite magnitudes in opposite directions, even if the variables' real effects are small and of the same sign. Diagnostics such as Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) will misleadingly validate Type 1 errors as legitimate results. After establishing general results via mathematical analysis and simulation, I provide guidelines for detection and mitigation. Managerial Summary: This article demonstrates mathematically how regression analyses with correlated independent variables may generate beta coefficients of opposite sign to the variables' true effects. To assess the likelihood of this possibility, I propose that: if (a) absolute correlation of two independent variables is about +/- 0.3 or more (smaller correlations may be problematic for large data sets), (b) the two variables have beta coefficients of opposite sign, if correlated positively, and of the same sign, if correlated negatively, and (c) the bivariate correlation of one independent variable with the dependent variable is of the opposite sign from the beta coefficient, then the beta might be a false positive. To facilitate such analysis, authors should provide complete correlation tables, including dependent variables, interaction terms, and quadratic terms.","['analytic model', 'econometrics', 'multicollinearity', 'multivariate regression', 'research methods', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH']",['multivariate regression'],"['regression', 'correlated variables', 'beta coefficients', 'variance inflation factors', 'mitigation']",0.0,0.0

Results suggested that LGB workers manage their stigmatized identity strategically according to situational characteristics.

"Auctions are receiving increasing attention from both practitioners and researchers in the TV advertising market. This paper studies advertisers' willingness to pay (WTP) in Hong Kong television commercial slot auctions, defined as overlapped, multiple-winner auctions with discrete, ascending, semi-sealed bids. We specify advertisers' WTP as a parametric function of their valuations of slot-specific attributes and the valuations that depend on the context of the focal auction and on the competition from other auctions of similar commercial slots. We extend the two noregret bidding principles (first proposed by Haile and Tamer 2003) to obtain informative boundary conditions for asymptotical identification. The estimation results suggest that advertisers' WTP increases with the TV rating of the program in which the advertisement is embedded and decreases with the bidder's bidding experience and the number of similar slot options available. The WTP also depends on the number of bidders classified into the same product category, as two directly competing advertisers are not allowed to advertise in the same commercial break. In the current practice, advertisers submit discrete bids using price levels set by the TV station. Based on the recovered bidder's WTP, we investigate how the TV station can set adjacent price levels and examine the resulting revenue implications.

"Research Summary Imprinting theory predicts that organizations are imprinted with multiple intersecting imprints that persist. Evidence suggests, however, that imprints are sometimes reprioritized or modified, implying that they can be strategically managed. We draw upon rhetorical history research and an in-depth historical case study of New Zealand's Gallagher Group to describe how one firm managed its imprints. Our inductive theorizing links historically imprinted strategic guideposts to decision-making via two rearranging processes-that is, prioritizing and suspending-wherein managers use narratives to rearrange guideposts' influence and two scope modifying processes-that is, constraining and expanding-wherein managers change where guideposts apply. As a first explanation of how imprints are managed, these processes add nuance to existing theory and open new research avenues regarding additional processes and boundary conditions. Managerial Summary Imprints are elements of culture, strategy, structure, or decision-making that emerge when the firm is founded or during times of turmoil. Imprints resist change and make organizational adaptation difficult. This study explains one way that managers manipulate imprinted decision-making rules so that organizations can adapt. Using an in-depth historical case study of New Zealand's Gallagher Group from 1938 to 2015, we follow four imprinted decision-making rules that we call strategic guideposts and show how managers rhetorically revised these rules to adapt organizational decision-making to changing environments. Managers prioritized some decision-making rules while deemphasizing others or they changed their claims about the kinds of decisions where a decision-rule applied. Knowing these rhetorical processes can help managers leverage their organization's history to facilitate necessary organizational change.","['imprinting theory', 'qualitative study', 'rhetorical history', 'strategic guideposts', 'ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY', 'FAMILY FIRMS', 'IRON CAGE', 'LEGACY', 'BUSINESS', 'IMPACT', 'DETERMINANTS', 'EVOLUTION', 'VENTURE', 'MEMORY']","['imprinting theory', 'rhetorical history', 'strategic guideposts']","['imprinting', 'organizations', 'historical case study', 'new zealand', 'strategic guideposts', 'decision making', 'culture']",0.14285714285714285,0.3333333333333333
"Considerable research has focused on candidate impression management (IM) use in unstructured interviews. However little research has explored candidate IM use in other frequently used assessment methods. This study examines the extent to which candidates, under consideration for a promotion, use verbal IM tactics in two types of structured individual assessment methods: a situational interview and a role-plays Based on a cybernetic model of IM, we predicted that IM use and effectiveness would vary across the two methods. Thus, this study examines the consistency of IM use across assessment methods; an issue that has not previously been explored. As expected, the situational interview resulted in greater use of candidate IM tactics. Additionally, other-focused tactics were used significantly more frequently than self-focused tactics in both assessment methods. IM use in the situational interview predicted assessor ratings and final promotion scores, while IM use in the role-play did not. Overall, these results provide indirect support for the cybernetic model of IM. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

"Social interaction between managers from different units of a multinational enterprise (MNE) has been shown to be an important factor stimulating intra-MNE knowledge-sharing. Face-to-face social interactions form a communication channel particularly conducive to the transfer of tacit, non-codified knowledge. But intensive social interaction also provides opportunities for social construction of knowledge in a learning dialogue. The first explanation (sender-receiver) makes us expect social interaction to moderate positively the effects of the factors giving rise to knowledge flows in the first place, such as differences in capabilities between MNE subsidiaries. The second perspective (social learning) also grants an independent effect to social interaction as a main factor stimulating intra-MNE knowledge flows. We formulate hypotheses based on both perspectives, and test these on data from 169 MNE subsidiaries. Our findings show a considerable main effect of social interaction on all intra-MNE knowledge flows, confirming the expectations based on the social learning model. Interaction effects, based on the predictions of the sender-receiver model, are only partly confirmed. These findings suggest that future research should devote more attention to the social constitution of MNE knowledge.

"Venture investing plays an important role in entrepreneurship not only because financial resources are important to new ventures, but also because early investors help shape the ventures' managerial and strategic destiny. In this study of 121 angel investors who had made 1038 new venture investments, we empirically investigate angel investors' differential use of predictive versus non-predictive control strategies. We show how the use of these strategies affects the outcomes of angel investors. Results show that angels who emphasize prediction make significantly larger venture investments, while those who emphasize non-predictive control experience a reduction in investment failures without a reduction in their number of successes.

"The global factory is a structure through which multinational enterprises integrate their global strategies through a combination of innovation, distribution and production of both goods and services. The global factory is analysed within a Coasean framework with particular attention to ownership and location policies using methods that illustrate its power in the global system. Developing countries are constrained by the existence and power of global factories. Firms in developing countries are frequently constrained to be suppliers of labour intensive manufacturing or services into the global factory system. Breaking into this system is difficult for emerging countries. It requires either a strategy of upgrading or the establishment of new global factories under the control of focal firms from emerging countries. The implementation of these strategies is formidably difficult. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

"The Zobele, located in Trento, Northern Italy, was founded in 1919 by Enrico Zobele Sr., who became famous when he invented his first killer product in 1930-flypaper. After the Second World War, the bombed-out factory was rebuilt by his sons, Luigi and Fulvio, who introduced new products for home hygiene and home care. The company globalized under the joint leaderships of Chief Executive Enrico Jr., son of Luigi, and Franco and Giovanni, sons of Fulvio. In 2001, Zobele Chemical Industries reported sales of US$75 million with profits of US$5.1 million. The company had 700 employees, factories in Italy, Spain, Brazil, Paraguay, India, Hong Kong, Mexico, and Malaysia with continuing expansions in Italy and China. This is a case study of the Zobele family and Zobele Chemical Industries, their past history, and present status. It centers on the challenges they face in ensuring global leadership in their served market niches, while maintaining the continuity of family ownership and control. This case presents the practical implications for family enterprises in their attempts to meet the challenges of a globalized marketplace. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

"Global online platforms match firms with service providers around the world, in services ranging from software development to copywriting and graphic design. Unlike in traditional offshore outsourcing, service providers are predominantly one-person microproviders located in emerging-economy countries not necessarily associated with offshoring and often disadvantaged by negative country images. How do these microproviders survive and thrive? We theorize global platforms through transaction cost economics (TCE), arguing that they are a new technology-enabled offshoring institution that emerges in response to cross-border information asymmetries that hitherto prevented microproviders from participating in offshoring markets. To explain how platforms achieve this, we adapt signaling theory to a TCE-based model and test our hypotheses by analyzing 6 months of transaction records from a leading platform. To help interpret the results and generalize them beyond a single platform, we introduce supplementary data from 107 face-to-face interviews with microproviders in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Individuals choose microprovidership when it provides a better return on their skills and labor than employment at a local (offshoring) firm. The platform acts as a signaling environment that allows microproviders to inform foreign clients of their quality, with platform-generated signals being the most informative signaling type. Platform signaling disproportionately benefits emerging-economy providers, allowing them to partly overcome the effects of negative country images and thus diminishing the importance of home country institutions. Global platforms in other factor and product markets likely promote cross-border microbusiness through similar mechanisms.","['selection/staffing', 'developing countries', 'international management', 'transaction cost economics', 'COUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN', 'STATISTICAL DISCRIMINATION', 'INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS', 'SIGNALING THEORY', 'SHARING ECONOMY', 'LABOR-MARKET', 'GIG ECONOMY', 'SERVICES', 'INFORMATION', 'CHALLENGES']","['transaction cost economics', 'signaling theory', 'services', 'information']","['microproviders', 'offshoring', 'transaction cost economics', 'signaling theory', 'signals']",0.4,0.5
"In order to establish a competitive advantage, firms must acquire or create resources at a price below their value in use. Absent pure lack, this requires managers to exercise foresight about a resource's future value and/or complementarities with pre-existing capabilities. This foresight grants managers the opportunity to exploit information asymmetries for personal gain as well as building organizational capabilities. Nevertheless, there is limited research on the extent Of foresight or how managers use it. In our study of insider trading, we found that managers purchase stock well before breakthrough patents are filed. We argue for further research on the extent of managerial foresight and how it affects rent generation and appropriation.

"Despite the high risk involved, thousands of individuals decide to start ventures. Past research, however, has found that entrepreneurs do not have a high-risk propensity, that is, a great willingness to knowingly take risks. This study, therefore, explores how individuals cope with the risks inherent in their decisions, and suggests that entrepreneurs may not perceive the riskiness of starting ventures. The study's findings suggest that risk perceptions may differ because certain types of cognitive biases lead individuals to perceive less risk. Cognitive biases are common types of mental shortcuts used to make judgments. This study examines three cognitive biases that previous research has suggested may lower risk perception. The first, overconfidence, refers to the failure to know the limits of one's knowledge. The second bias tested, the illusion of control, occurs when individuals overemphasize the extent to which their skill can increase performance in situations where chance plays a large part and skill is not necessarily the deciding factor. Because the individuals believe that they can control largely uncontrollable events, they also think they can accurately predict the outcome of the events. Finally, the third bias, the belief in the law of small numbers occurs when an individual uses a limited number of informational inputs (a small sample of information) to draw firm conclusions. This study's sample consisted of 191 students pursuing a Masters of Business Administration. The students' responses to a survey based on a case study regarding a decision to start a venture were examined. The survey included questions about the students' willingness to start the venture, their perception of the venture's riskiness, and the extent to which they exhibited cognitive biases in their decision processes. The study's findings tentatively suggest that individuals start ventures because they do not perceive the risks involved, and not because they knowingly accept high levels of risks. The belief in the law of small numbers lowered an individual's perceptions of a venture's riskiness, suggesting that some individuals draw firm conclusions from small samples. An illusion of control also decreased risk perception, suggesting that individuals starting ventures might not acknowledge that certain tasks, important to the venture's success, are beyond their control. Some argue that biases might be associated with venture failure. If this is the case, the very processes that increase the likelihood of starting a venture may actually decrease performance Entrepreneurs may choose to minimize their biases by soliciting and paying heed to the advice of outsiders, or by using group decision-making techniques, such as devil's advocacy or dialectical inquiry. Others, however, suggest that early in the decision process, biases may be beneficial because they lower risk perception, which allows entrepreneurs to generate the commitment needed for success. Even if this is mle, entrepreneurs should still institute processes to increase learning so the venture can adjust to unfolding realities and avoid any damage caused by initial misperceptions. Similarly, entrepreneurs need adequate safety nets in case their biases lead them to encounter unforeseen difficulties. The potential positive and negative effects of biases and perceiving low levels of risk suggest the importance of exploring this area further.

"We provide a comprehensive but critical review of research on applicant reactions to selection procedures published since 2000 (n = 145), when the last major review article on applicant reactions appeared in the Journal of Management. We start by addressing the main criticisms levied against the field to determine whether applicant reactions matter to individuals and employers (So what?). This is followed by a consideration of What's new? by conducting a comprehensive and detailed review of applicant reaction research centered upon four areas of growth: expansion of the theoretical lens, incorporation of new technology in the selection arena, internationalization of applicant reactions research, and emerging boundary conditions. Our final section focuses on Where to next? and offers an updated and integrated conceptual model of applicant reactions, four key challenges, and eight specific future research questions. Our conclusion is that the field demonstrates stronger research designs, with studies incorporating greater control, broader constructs, and multiple time points. There is also solid evidence that applicant reactions have significant and meaningful effects on attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. At the same time, we identify some remaining gaps in the literature and a number of critical questions that remain to be explored, particularly in light of technological and societal changes.","['applicant reactions to selection', 'selection/staffing', 'job search', 'justice/fairness', 'recruitment', 'FACE-TO-FACE', 'PERCEIVED JOB DISCRIMINATION', 'SOCIAL NETWORKING WEBSITES', 'CRITERION-RELATED VALIDITY', 'COGNITIVE-ABILITY TEST', 'INTERNET-BASED TESTS', 'PAPER-AND-PENCIL', 'PERSONNEL-SELECTION', 'FAIRNESS REACTIONS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE']",['applicant reactions to selection'],[],0,0.0
"Extending our understanding of family firms and international business research with respect to entry mode decisions, this study explains how entry mode choice is the product of a sequential decision-making process, with an important ownership structure contingency. We propose that firms with a dominant family owner (family-dominant firms) prefer low equity ownership as their entry mode for the purpose of preserving their socioemotional wealth. Their preference is persistent even when the institutional investors are the dominant shareholders in the firm (family-influenced firms). This nuanced examination of the role family values play in the entry mode decision extends our understanding of how family firms enter international markets.","['family firms', 'entry mode decisions', 'institutional investors', 'sequential decision making', 'FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'MARKET ENTRY', 'SOCIOEMOTIONAL WEALTH', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'ACQUISITION ENTRY', 'EQUITY OWNERSHIP', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CHOICE', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'DETERMINANTS']","['family firms', 'entry mode decisions', 'institutional investors', 'sequential decision making', 'socioemotional wealth', 'equity ownership', 'choice']","['family firms', 'entry mode', 'ownership']",0.3333333333333333,0.14285714285714285
"Successful marketing of an IPO issuer depends on the issuer's attractiveness to early stage stakeholders such as underwriters and institutional investors. However, there is limited research on how these stakeholders evaluate IPO issuers. We investigate how a multitude of cues influence underwriter prestige and price shortfall. In addition, we draw on cue utilization theory and the attention-based view of the firm to hypothesize contrasting uses of cues by underwriters and institutional investors. An empirical examination of 119 IPOs using 2SLS identifies cues that help increase underwriter prestige and reduce price shortfall. Furthermore, our estimation reveals important differences between the two early stage stakeholders-whereas underwriters rely more on intrinsic cues to evaluate the attractiveness of IPO issuers, institutional investors rely more on extrinsic cues. These findings have important theoretical implications as well as normative implications for marketing an IPO issuer in early stages of the IPO process.","['IPO marketing', 'Cue utilization', 'Attention-based view', 'INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS', 'PRODUCT-HARM CRISES', 'UNDERWRITER REPUTATION', 'RETAILER REPUTATION', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'PRIOR KNOWLEDGE', 'WALL-STREET', 'BRAND-NAME', 'INFORMATION', 'QUALITY']","['cue utilization', 'attention based view']","['underwriters', 'institutional investors', 'attention based view']",0.3333333333333333,0.5
"With recent legislation mandating that publicly traded corporations submit their CEOs' compensation for a nonbinding shareholder vote, a systematic understanding of shareholder preferences has never been so important. In spite of this, relatively little is known about what impacts shareholders' preferences and, subsequently, their ultimate voting behavior. We integrate two theories to help frame the question and to help predict shareholder behavior. Per agency theory, shareholders, as principals, will disapprove of high CEO rewards and poor firm performance, symmetrically assessing gains and losses. Per prospect theory, shareholders will be loss averse, responding much more strongly to being in a loss position than to being in a gain or neutral position. We combine these theories' predictions in two lab experiments in which we simulate a shareholder say-on-pay vote, hypothesizing that shareholders will be concerned with agency costs, but only when they are in a loss position. The results of these simulated votes suggest that shareholders do value pay for performance, in keeping with agency theory. However, shareholders exhibit this focus on agency-normative prescriptions asymmetrically, showing loss aversion in keeping with prospect theory. This finding has significant implications for both theory and practice as shareholder votes become a regular and high-profile occurrence.","['nan', 'BEHAVIORAL AGENCY MODEL', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'CEO COMPENSATION', 'LOSS AVERSION', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'PROSPECT-THEORY', 'INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS', 'MANAGERIAL COMPENSATION']","['loss aversion', 'firm performance', 'prospect theory']","['agency theory', 'rewards', 'firm performance', 'agency costs']",0.25,0.3333333333333333
"E-commerce offers retailers the opportunity to attract new customers online; however, consumer distrust toward unfamiliar retailers can seriously impede these efforts. Construal Level Theory suggests that such distrust can be partially understood in terms of psychological distance, and that reducing psychological distance using simple website tactics should overcome distrust and encourage first-time purchases. Studies 1 and 2 show a physically distant retail store, or lack of a physical store altogether, contribute to psychological distance, distrust, and reluctance to purchase online. Studies 2 and 3 further show that website images of an office building (increased tangibility), or the owner's name and appearance (social proximity), can improve trust and purchase intentions by specifically reducing the psychological distance otherwise associated with purely virtual or physically distant retailers.

"The present study proposes a trickle-down model of employee empowerment in which empowerment climate at the organization level is positively related to the empowering leadership of team leaders and ultimately to individual task performance. Importantly, we hypothesize that team leaders' and members' narcissism can respectively inhibit and enable the cross-level empowerment process by affecting the intended distribution of decision-making authority and resources between team leaders and members. The analysis of data from 834 team members of 189 teams in 46 organizations reveals that organizational empowerment climate is positively related to team leaders' empowering leadership when they are less narcissistic. Empowering leadership is positively related to individual task performance when team members are highly narcissistic. Finally, we observe that the combination of less narcissistic leaders and more narcissistic members is a condition under which the indirect effect of organizational empowerment climate on individual task performance through empowering leadership is positive.","['empowering leadership', 'narcissism', 'organizational empowerment climate', 'task performance', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL EMPOWERMENT', 'PERSONALITY', 'LEADERSHIP', 'BEHAVIOR', 'MODEL', 'SELF', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'VALIDATION']","['empowering leadership', 'narcissism', 'organizational empowerment climate', 'task performance', 'leadership', 'model']","['trickle down', 'employee empowerment', 'empowering leadership', 'task performance', 'narcissism', 'organizational empowerment']",0.5,0.5
"Although the success of team-based organizations requires innovative behavior within and across teams, little research has considered how to foster both types of activity. This is problematic as strong team attachments such as team identification may have mixed effects on team innovative behavior, and may even negatively impact cross-team innovative behavior. The present research explains these mixed effects through intra- and intergroup aspects of social identity theory and the concept of team reflexivity. Effects of team identification on team innovative behavior were expected to be contingent upon team reflexivity, such that team identification would be positively related to team innovative behavior only when team reflexivity was high. Where a team's innovative behavior involves working across team boundaries with other teams, i.e., cross-team innovative behavior, this interaction between team identification and reflexivity was further expected to be qualified by perceived interdependence with another team. In a sample of 61 Turkish research and development (R&D) teams comprising 305 employees and 61 team leaders, the association between team identity and team innovative behavior was moderated by team reflexivity as predicted. Further, team identity was positively associated with cross-team innovative behavior only when reflexivity and perceived interdependence between teams were both high, and negatively associated when reflexivity was low and perceived interdependence between teams was high.","['nan', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY', 'INDIVIDUALISM-COLLECTIVISM', 'MULTIPLE-REGRESSION', 'INTERGROUP CONTACT', 'GOAL ORIENTATION', 'WORK', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'CREATIVITY', 'BOUNDARY', 'PERFORMANCE']","['social identity', 'work']","['social identity', 'interdependence']",0.5,0.5
"Prosocial work behaviors in a globalized environment do not operate in a cultural vacuum. We assess to what extent voice and helping organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) vary across cultures, depending on employees' perceived level of organizational formalization and national uncertainty. We predict that in contexts of uncertainty, cognitive resources are engaged in coping with this uncertainty. Organizational formalization can provide structure that frees up cognitive resources to engage in OCB. In contrast, in contexts of low uncertainty, organizational formalization is not necessary for providing structure and may increase constraints on discretionary behavior. A three-level hierarchical linear modeling analysis of data from 7,537 employees in 267 organizations across 17 countries provides broad support for our hypothesis: perceived organizational formalization is weakly related to OCB, but where uncertainty is high; formalization facilitates voice significantly, helping OCB to a lesser extent. Our findings contribute to clarifying the dynamics between perceptions of norms at organizational and national levels for understanding when employees may engage in helping and voice behaviors. The key implication is that managers can foster OCB through organizational formalization interventions in uncertain environments that are cognitively demanding.","['organizational citizenship behavior', 'culture', 'uncertainty', 'formalization', 'multilevel analysis', 'EXTRA-ROLE BEHAVIORS', 'INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS', 'JOB-SATISFACTION', 'BUREAUCRACY', 'CONCEPTUALIZATIONS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'CONSTRUCT', 'CULTURES', 'IMPACT', 'LEADER']","['organizational citizenship behavior', 'culture', 'uncertainty', 'formalization', 'cultures']","['work behaviors', 'helping organizational citizenship behaviors', 'organizational formalization']",0.0,0.0

Further, we categorize the firms into state-controlled and privately owned according to majority ownership. We find that the determinants of internationalization differ based on ownership. State-controlled firms are attracted to countries with large sources of natural resources and risky political environments. Private firms are more market seekers. Although all firms have strategic intent, the attraction is commercially viable technology rather than core research content.

"Firms sometimes engage in myopic management (e.g., cutting marketing spending, providing lenient credit to customers to improve short-term results). Although marketing is at the center of such myopic management, there are few insights on whether a marketing department could prevent it. To address this gap, the authors examine the role of powerful marketing departments in preventing myopic marketing spending and revenue management. They hypothesize that there are internal and external enablers of marketing department power (i.e., a chief executive officer with marketing experience, the firm's power over its customers, analyst coverage, and institutional stock ownership) that help a powerful marketing department prevent myopic management. They test the hypotheses using a panel of 781 publicly listed U.S. firms between 2000 and 2015. As hypothesized, when the firm has (1) a chief executive officer with a marketing background and (2) power over its customers, increasing marketing department power decreases the likelihood of both myopic marketing spending and myopic revenue management; increasing marketing department power and analyst coverage decreases the likelihood of myopic marketing spending. The findings highlight powerful marketing leadership as a hitherto overlooked way to prevent myopic management and improve firm performance.","['marketing department power', 'myopic management', 'myopic marketing spending', 'myopic revenue management', 'power over customers', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'EARNINGS MANAGEMENT', 'STOCK-MARKET', 'INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS', 'FIRM INNOVATION', 'REAL ACTIVITIES', 'CUSTOMER POWER', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INVESTMENT', 'OFFICERS']","['marketing department power', 'myopic management', 'myopic marketing spending', 'myopic revenue management', 'performance']","['myopic management', 'institutional stock ownership', 'powerful marketing leadership', 'firm performance']",0.25,0.2

"Purpose - This paper proposes discussing the growing supply chain pressures, both legal and commercial, the background to them and their implications for countries with large consumer markets, such as the UK and for countries, such as the Republic of China, which are suppliers, but themselves increasingly important as consumer markets. Design/methodology/approach - Having regard to the multi disciplinary nature of the readership the paper does not focus too narrowly on legal regulation: nevertheless the legal perspective is important in at least one respect. The imposition of law and penalties provides a powerful incentive to behavioural change, and is very effective in focussing attention. Findings - The paper reveals that plainly it will be a challenge for supplier countries, as it will be for industry in the West, to meet new regulatory standards, particularly those which aim to force technology, like the vehicle emission standards referred to above, or standards relating to supply chain management, which will intervene in the established contractual arrangements between suppliers and their customers. It will also be a challenge to meet consumer demand for greener products as education of consumers in sustainability issues improves. Originality - This paper contributes towards green supply chain management that is emerging to be an important approach for enterprises to improve performance. Managerial implications are also identified.","['Low carbon', 'Green supply chain', 'Supply chain management', 'Environmental management', 'nan']","['green supply chain', 'supply chain management']","['china', 'supply chain management']",0.5,0.5
"This conceptual paper explores the cultural dimensions of corporate political activity (CPA). Concerned that prior research into firms' political actions has been insensitive to culture and its impact on corporate strategising, national culture is introduced as an explanatory factor behind managers' political objectives and the strategies they prefer to use in pursuit of those objectives. The paper adds to existing research by unpacking and examining corporate political action at a deeper, more complex, human level. Understanding that corporate political strategies are affected by culture enables politically-active managers to anticipate, respond to and act on strategies pursued by competitor firms from other countries.

Relying on concepts from the science, technology, and society field of study and actor-network theory, we approach the production of scientific knowledge as a cultural, practical, and material affair. Specifically, we analyze the activities deployed by decision analysts to overcome the challenges of making a discipline built on Bayes' legacy scientifically acceptable, managerially relevant, and long lasting. As a novel contribution to the discussion on the Bayesian revolution, our study goes beyond institutional accounts of the legitimation of Bayesianism to highlight the role of politics and material artifacts in past and current attempts at importing Bayesianism.

In an effort to help resolve this ambiguity, we used meta-analysis to aggregate results from 44 studies containing 140 tests of ten hypotheses. The ten hypotheses reflect two theoretical perspectives-resource scarcity and agency theory.

"The study reported here assessed the impact of managers' philosophies of human nature on their reactions to influential academic claims and counter-claims of when human judgment is likely to stray from rational-actor standards and of how organizations can correct these biases. Managers evaluated scenarios that depicted decision-making processes at micro, meso, and macro levels of analysis: alleged cognitive biases of individuals, strategies of structuring and coping with accountability relationships between supervisors and employees, and strategies that corporate entities use to cope with accountability demands from the broader society. Political ideology and cognitive style emerged as consistent predictors of the value spins that managers placed on decisions at all three levels of analysis. Specifically, conservative managers with strong preferences for cognitive closure were most likely (a) to defend simple heuristic-driven errors such as overattribution and overconfidence and to warn of the mirror-image mistakes of failing to hold people accountable and of diluting sound policies with irrelevant side-objectives; (b) to be skeptical of complex strategies of structuring or coping with accountability and to praise those who lay down clear rules and take decisive stands; (c) to prefer simple philosophies of corporate governance (the shareholder over stakeholder model) and to endorse organizational norms such as hierarchical filtering that reduce cognitive overload on top management by short-circuiting unnecessary argumentation. Intuitive theories of good judgment apparently cut across levels of analysis and are deeply grounded in personal epistemologies and political ideologies.","['nan', 'ACCOUNTABILITY', 'JUDGMENT', 'CHOICE']","['accountability', 'judgment']","['political ideology', 'cognitive style', 'corporate governance']",0.0,0.0
"Relatively little research explores observed differences in pay dispersion across organizations and whether those observed differences have consequences for employee behaviors. Using data from two managerial compensation samples, we found that an organization's context-its environment and diversification strategy-is related to differences in pay dispersion across firms. We also found that pay dispersion within an organization is related to the tenure of managers and the likelihood of their leaving the organization.","['nan', 'INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY SET', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'INCENTIVES', 'DIVIDEND', 'POLICIES', 'JUSTICE', 'COLLEGE']",['environment'],[],0,0.0
"This article Focuses upon innovation and issues in on-line market research. On-line research, on-line consumer behavior, and e-commerce are new areas of academic study in marketing. Most of the early work in these areas was done by practitioners, as illustrated by research reports and case, studies presented at professional conferences. The present article reviews technologies and methods of on-line research and points to various methodological and ethical issues. On-line research is evaluated From two perspectives: orthodox thinking about the! validity of research, and out-of-the-box thinking about how on-line research can increase the impact of market research and develop the core competitive capabilities of firms.

"Previous research on capital investment has identified a tendency in multibusiness firms toward cross-subsidization from well-performing to poorly performing divisions, a phenomenon that has previously been attributed to principal-agent conflicts between headquarters and divisions (Stein, 2003). In this paper, we argue that cross-subsidization reflects a more general tendency toward even allocation over all divisions in multibusiness firms that is driven, at least in part, by the cognitive tendency to naively diversify when making investment decisions (Benartzi and Thaler, 2001). We observe that this tendency also leads to partition dependence in which capital allocations vary systematically with the divisions and subdivisions into which the firm is organized or over which capital is allocated. Our first study uses archival data to show that firms' internal capital allocations are biased toward equality over the number of business units into which the firm is partitioned. Two further experimental studies of experienced managers examine whether this bias persists when participants are asked to allocate capital to various divisions of a hypothetical firm. This methodology eliminates the possibility of agency conflicts. Nevertheless, allocations varied systematically with the divisional and subdivisional structure of the firm and with a centralized or decentralized capital allocation manner.

The findings challenge the presupposition that possession is the ultimate expression of consumer desire and illustrate that contemporary art collectors and visitors choose collection or visits based on different desires.

"How do we, as management researchers, develop novel theoretical contributions and, thereby, potentially break new ground in management studies? To address this question, we review previous methodological work on theorizing and advance a typology of the reasoning processes that underlie theoretical contributions and significant advances in management studies. This typology consists of various types of analogical and counterfactual reasoning, ranging from focused thought experiments aimed at prodding existing theory in the direction of alternative assumptions, constructs, and hypotheses to more expansive efforts for inducing new theoretical models and alternative explanations. Applying this typology, we detail the mechanisms behind the formation of novel theoretical contributions and illustrate the currency of our typology through a review of 24 major theoretical breakthroughs in management studies. We conclude the paper by discussing the implications of this typology for our collective efforts in building, elaborating, and expanding theory in management studies.","['analogy', 'counterfactuals', 'management research', 'theoretical contribution', 'theory', 'COUNTERFACTUAL THINKING', 'BUILDING THEORY', 'OPPORTUNITIES', 'CONSTITUTES', 'RETHINKING', 'METAPHOR', 'FUTURE', 'ISSUES']","['management research', 'theoretical contribution', 'theory']","['researchers', 'experiments', 'breakthroughs']",0.0,0.0
"Firms increasingly use social network sites to reach out to customers and proactively intervene with observed consumer messages. Despite intentions to enhance customer satisfaction by extending customer service, sometimes these interventions are received negatively by consumers. We draw on privacy regulation theory to theorize how proactive customer service interventions with consumer messages on social network sites may evoke feelings of privacy infringement. Subsequently we use privacy calculus theory to propose how these perceptions of privacy infringement, together with the perceived usefulness of the intervention, in turn drive customer satisfaction. In two experiments, we find that feelings of privacy infringement associated with proactive interventions may explain why only reactive interventions enhance customer satisfaction. Moreover, we find that customer satisfaction can be modeled through the calculus of the perceived usefulness and feelings of privacy infringement associated with an intervention. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the impact of privacy concerns on consumer behavior in the context of firm-consumer interactions on social network sites, extend the applicability of privacy calculus theory, and contribute to complaint and compliment management literature. To practitioners, our findings demonstrate that feelings of privacy are an element to consider when handling consumer messages on social media, but also that privacy concerns may be overcome if an intervention is perceived as useful enough.","['Consumer complaints', 'consumer messages', 'customer service', 'eWOM', 'online privacy', 'online service', 'SNS', 'social network sites', 'WORD-OF-MOUTH', 'USER ACCEPTANCE', 'ONLINE', 'SATISFACTION', 'INFORMATION', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DETERMINANTS', 'FRAMEWORK', 'PARADOX', 'IMPACT']","['consumer messages', 'customer service', 'social network sites', 'satisfaction', 'impact']","['social network sites', 'satisfaction', 'privacy infringement', 'privacy calculus theory', 'perceived usefulness']",0.4,0.4
"Assessing the relative importance of predictors has been of historical importance in a variety of disciplines including management, medicine, economics, and psychology. When approaching hypotheses on the relative ordering of the magnitude of predicted effects (e.g., the effects of discrimination from managers and coworkers are larger than that from clients), one quickly runs into problems within a traditional frequentist framework. Null hypothesis significance testing does not allow researchers to directly map research hypotheses on to results and suffers from a multiple testing problem that leads to low statistical power. Furthermore, all traditional structural equation modeling fit indices lose much of their suitability for model comparison, because order hypotheses are not countable in terms of degrees of freedom. To adequately tackle order hypotheses, we advocate a Bayesian method that provides a single internally consistent solution for estimation and inference. The key element in the proposed model comparison approach is the use of the Bayes factor and the incorporation of order constraints by means of a smart formulation of prior distributions. An easy-to-use software package BIEMS (Bayesian inequality and equality constrained model selection) is introduced and two empirical examples in the organizational behavior area are provided to showcase the method, both offering new findings that have implications for theory: the first on the differential impact of discrimination in the workplace from insiders and outsiders to the organization on employees' well-being, and the second on Karasek's stressor-strain theory about how the relative order of magnitude of the effects of job control and demands depends on the specific well-being outcome dimension.","['Bayes factor', 'order hypotheses', 'model comparison', 'workplace discrimination', 'well-being', ""Karasek's job control-demands model"", 'MODEL', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'DISCRIMINATION', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'INEQUALITY', 'HARASSMENT', 'INDEXES', 'MORALE', 'POWER', 'FIT']","['bayes factor', 'order hypotheses', 'model comparison', 'well being', 'model', 'discrimination', 'inequality', 'power', 'fit']","['discrimination', 'structural equation modeling', 'inequality']",0.6666666666666666,0.2222222222222222

"Research summary: We investigate the effects of monitoring by boards of directors and institutional shareholders on merger and acquisition (M&A) performance extremeness using a sample of M&A deals from 1997 to 2006. Both governance research and legal reforms generally have espoused a raise all boats view of monitoring. We instead investigate whether monitoring may serve as a double-edged sword that limits CEO discretion to undertake both value-destroying M&A deals and value-creating ones. Our findings indicate that the relationship between monitoring and M&A performance is more complex than previously believed. Rather than raising all boats in a shift towards better M&A outcomes, monitoring instead is associated with lower M&A losses, but also with lower M&A gains. Managerial summary: Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are a quintessential corporate activity. There were $3.8trillion worth of M&A deals in 2015, despite scholars and practitioners reporting that M&As often perform poorly. We question the widespread belief that more vigilant monitoring by boards of directors and large shareholders will raise M&A performance, overall. Put differently, does monitoring constrain CEOs' discretion to pursue bad deals, while simultaneously encouraging them to pursue good ones? We find that monitoring limits both large M&A losses and large M&A gains. Contrary to widely held beliefs, our results indicate that constraining executives' ability to pursue value-destroying M&A deals does not simultaneously encourage or enable CEOs to pursue value-creating deals.

Findings - Sixteen elements are identified and presented in a framework along with their proposed constituents. The elements capture structures and management principles of supply chains that are important for social responsibility. Research limitations/implications - The elements provide a basis to better understand how social responsibility in supply chains is related to contextual factors. The framework of elements is still only an initial step toward enhanced understanding of how the context affects social responsibility in supply chains. Practical implications - The framework may guide companies to acknowledge elements that are known to improve or deteriorate social responsibility in supply chains.

"Although customized price promotions are increasingly common in the marketplace, relatively little is known about how deal recipients evaluate them. The authors investigate the role of a promotional characteristic that has received little attention in the literature by examining whether consumers' responsiveness to a targeted discount is influenced by their perceptions of the deal's exclusivity (i.e., the degree to which the offer is available only to them or to other consumers as well). The results demonstrate that exclusive promotions may be viewed more, equally, or less favorably than inclusive offers, depending on several factors used in decisions about the delivery of targeted offers (e.g., customer demographics, transactional histories). Specifically, the authors find that exclusive deals are favored over inclusive offers (Study 1), a preference that is pronounced for consumers adopting independent self-construals (Study 2) and for male consumers with a history of purchasing from the marketer providing the offer (Study 3). These exclusivity effects are mediated by the ability of the promotional offer to allow consumers to engage in self-enhancement (Study 3).","['customized price promotions', 'targeted deals', 'self-construal', 'gender', 'customer-company relationships', 'SELF', 'CUSTOMERS', 'FAIRNESS', 'JUSTICE', 'DETERMINANTS', 'INEQUITY', 'LOYALTY', 'GENDER', 'GOALS']","['customized price promotions', 'self construal', 'self']","['price promotions', 'inclusive offers']",0.0,0.0
"This paper investigates how early venture entrepreneurs engage in socially embedded practices to resource their firm. We contribute to an emerging literature that calls for a shift in perspective from resource as an object to resourcing as a practice. This shift entails a focus away from whom entrepreneurs know toward how they engage with their venture's social contexts. Through the analysis of an in-depth longitudinal case study of a life-science venture, we show that social resourcing practices are more reminiscent of a creative coping with ambiguous and ever-changing environments over time than of heroic strategizing. We explore how entrepreneurs mobilize and creatively combine their social resources at hand, seek resources through engaging with other practice nets, negotiate differences between practice nets, and reflectively adapt their resourcing practices toward emerging resource contexts in ways that we describe as riding the practice waves of social resourcing.","['nan', 'NETWORK TIES', 'BRICOLAGE', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LEGITIMACY', 'GROWTH', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'SURVIVAL', 'INDUSTRY', 'CREATION']",['perspective'],[],0,0.0
"Customer experience management research is increasingly concerned with the long-term evolution of customer experience journeys across multiple service cycles. A dominant smooth journey model makes customers' lives easier, with a cyclical pattern of predictable experiences that builds customer loyalty over time, also known as a loyalty loop. An alternate sticky journey model makes customers' lives exciting, with a cyclical pattern of unpredictable experiences that increases customer involvement over time, conceptualized here as an involvement spiral. Whereas the smooth journey model is ideal for instrumental services that facilitate jobs to be done, the sticky journey model is ideal for recreational services that facilitate never-ending adventures. To match the flow of each journey type, firms are advised to encourage purchases during the initial service cycles of smooth journeys, or subsequent service cycles of sticky journeys. In multiservice systems, firms can sustain customer journeys by interlinking loyalty loops and involvement spirals. The article concludes with new journey-centered questions for customer experience management research, as well as branding research, consumer culture theory, consumer psychology, and transformative service research.","['attention economy', 'customer experience management', 'customer involvement', 'customer journey design', 'customer loyalty', 'experience economy', 'experiential involvement', 'service design', 'CONSUMPTION', 'CONSUMERS', 'FRAMEWORK', 'IDENTITY', 'MODEL']","['customer experience management', 'customer involvement', 'customer loyalty', 'model']","['customer experience management', 'customer experience journeys', 'customer involvement', 'involvement spiral']",0.5,0.5

"For brands to thrive, they must understand consumer sentiment; if consumers' likelihood of sharing their opinion is a function of their attitude toward a brand, then brands' perception of consumer sentiment may be systematically biased. While research in consumer-to-consumer sharing (i.e., word of mouth) suggests that those with extreme attitude are more likely to share than those with neutral attitude (a U-shaped relationship), the relationship between consumers' attitude toward a brand and their propensity to sharewith a brandis unknown. In contrast to the U-shaped pattern observed in word of mouth, the authors find a hockey stick-shaped relationship between attitude and sharing with brands (__/). Those with positive attitude (vs. neutral attitude) are more likely to share their opinion, but those with negative attitude do not show a similar increase in sharing. The authors show that this pattern emerges because, among consumers with positive (vs. neutral) attitude toward a brand, reciprocity norms drive increased sharing, but among consumers with negative (vs. neutral) attitude, competing mechanisms drive behavior: the desire to vent increases sharing, but at the same time an aversion to criticize others directly deters sharing. The authors test these ideas using a series of studies, including a field study.","['attitude', 'aversion to criticize', 'brand feedback', 'consumer-to-brand sharing', 'reciprocity', 'surveys', 'venting', 'word of mouth', 'WORD-OF-MOUTH', 'CONSUMER COMPLAINT INTENTIONS', 'NUISANCE PARAMETER', 'BEHAVIOR', 'INFORMATION', 'RELUCTANCE', 'STRANGERS', 'RESPONSES']","['attitude', 'aversion to criticize', 'reciprocity', 'word of mouth', 'word of mouth', 'behavior']","['consumer sentiment', 'attitude', 'sharing', 'word of mouth']",0.5,0.3333333333333333

"Purpose - This study aims to examine the management of food supply chains in complex and volatile business environments, where the sustainability requirements of customers and legislation are increasing. This challenging situation gives rise to the question as to how a logistics company can achieve and sustain competitive advantage through environmentally-oriented sustainability. Design/methodology/approach - This empirical study gathers insights on emerging practices in European food service supply chains from two parallel Delphi surveys conducted with 145 industry experts from 27 countries. The long-term industry expectations of a leading provider in food service logistics are compared with an industry-wide external panel. The questions were designed to understand how managers perceive the emerging domain of sustainability in supply chains. Findings - Environmentally oriented sustainability will remain a key driver of success in the field. However, after applying the dominant logic concept for analyzing results, it becomes apparent that managers have to continuously challenge internal existing expectations to translate an emerging domain into strategy. We show how the senior management team under investigation was challenged in its dominant logic and how it tried to overcome this situation during strategy development. Originality/value - The study shows how managers perceive and cope with the emerging domain of environmentally oriented sustainability, how they translate it into strategy, and utilize resources for creating customer value. The research supports managers in adapting to new competitive environments. Furthermore, the study contributes by visualizing the dominant logic of a firm and the approach of top management for adjustment.","['Sustainability', 'Business environment', 'Dominant logic', 'Food service supply chain', 'REVERSE LOGISTICS', 'OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'DOMINANT LOGIC', 'DELPHI METHOD', 'REAL-TIME', 'PERFORMANCE', 'QUALITY', 'CHALLENGES', 'FRAMEWORK']","['sustainability', 'business environment', 'dominant logic', 'food service supply chain', 'competitive advantage', 'dominant logic']","['sustainability', 'competitive advantage', 'dominant logic']",1.0,0.5

They initially discuss two specific changes related to the overall shift: changes concerning primary marketing coordinators and increasing dispersion of marketing activities. They then introduce the concept of a customer-focused organizational structure that uses groups of customers as the primary basis for structuring the organization.

Even in technologically less advanced countries, knowledge outflows are only slightly weaker than inflows.

"Purpose - This paper seeks to introduce a six-sigma based methodology for the SCM domain which was developed and has been used in Samsung. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides a detailed description of how and why a six-sigma-based methodology for the SCM domain was developed in Samsung and presents a real industry case to illustrate the usage of the methodology. Findings - In Samsung, the effort and investment in synthesizing SCM and six sigma, and developing a unique six-sigma-based methodology to improve its SCM operation, have turned out to be fruitful. The Black Belt program has produced highly qualified and talented SCM specialists, who are currently training the methodology to members in their organizations and leading SCM projects. SCM projects are being prepared and conducted in a more disciplined way and their outcomes are continuously monitored and shared through the company's repository. Research limitations/implications - To generalize its usefulness, the methodology needs to be applied to the SCM projects of those companies whose organizational and cultural contexts are different from those of Samsung. In addition, the overview of an illustrative SCM project presented in the paper is brief due to space limitations. Practical implications - Today, SCM is increasingly recognized as a strategic way to innovate a company's business operation. This paper shows that a methodology such as Samsung's SCM six sigma can be the key to conducting SCM projects in a more disciplined way and for fruitful outcomes.

"Previous research has identified customer satisfaction and customer-company identification as two of the most important concepts in relationship marketing. Yet despite their proclaimed importance, research on their long-term effectiveness is surprisingly scarce. Furthermore, comparative research acknowledging the concepts' different theoretical roots and illuminating the differences in their long-term effectiveness is lacking. In addition, little is known about how competitive actions affect the long-term effectiveness of both concepts. This study makes a first attempt to address these research gaps and offers a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of customer satisfaction and customer-company identification in driving important customer outcomes over time. Latent growth analyses of rich longitudinal data from customers over nine measurement points spanning 43 weeks (n = 6,930) show that customer satisfaction and customer-company identification have positive initial effects on customers' loyalty and willingness to pay but differ in their ability to maintain these positive effects over time. Whereas the positive effects of customer satisfaction decrease more rapidly, the effects of customer-company identification are significantly more persistent. Analysis of the moderating effects of relative competitive advertising suggests that customer-company identification is more effective at immunizing customers against competitive actions.","['customer satisfaction', 'customer-company identification', 'customer loyalty', 'customer willingness to pay', 'latent growth modeling', 'CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTIFICATION', 'CONSUMER SATISFACTION', 'SATISFIED CUSTOMERS', 'SELF-EXPRESSION', 'UNITED-STATES', 'MARKET SHARE', 'GROWTH']","['customer satisfaction', 'customer company identification', 'willingness to pay', 'growth']","['customer satisfaction', 'customer company identification', 'competitive actions', 'latent growth']",0.5,0.5
"Research Summary Does it pay to be a multinational? Despite decades of empirical research, we still do not know. We undertake a large-sample, cross-national replication of Lu and Beamish (2004) and Berry and Kaul's (2016) works to examine whether the multinationality-performance relationship is S-shaped in a 2009-2016 panel of 889,865 firm-year observations. Using a two-stage least squares fixed-effects model that accounts for endogeneity on a subsample of 32,835 multinationals from 64 countries, we find no evidence of an S-shaped relationship; nor do we see it in any of the single-country contexts. Our results show no evidence of any within-firm effect of multinationality on performance, highlighting the need for more contextually-grounded research focused on explaining between-firm effects to advance our theoretical and empirical understanding of the multinationality-performance relationship. Managerial Summary We replicate two studies that examined the relationship between a firm's multinationality and its performance. Lu and Beamish (2004) found evidence of an S-shaped relationship-with performance first decreasing, then increasing, then decreasing again as firms expanded abroad-in a sample of Japanese firms; Berry and Kaul (2016) found no evidence of an S-shaped pattern in a sample of U.S. multinationals. We test for the same relationship using data from nearly 250,000 firms based in over 100 countries from 2009 to 2016 and find no evidence of an S-shaped pattern or of any effect of multinationality. Our study thus adds substantial evidence to the one shown by Berry and Kaul (2016), emphasizing the need to focus on how contextual differences influence the multinationality-performance relationship.","['firm performance', 'multinationality', 'panel data', 'replication', 'S-curve', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'DIVERSITY', 'DIRECTORS', 'STRATEGY', 'ENTRY']","['multinationality', 'replication']","['cross national replication', 'multinationality performance relationship', 'endogeneity']",0.0,0.0
"Studies of grocery sales show that consumers of store brands switch to (price) discounted national brands more than consumers of national brands switch to discounted store brands. Such asymmetric price competition can be explained with numerous mechanisms proposed here and elsewhere. We report a choice experiment that replicates asymmetric price competition favoring higher-quality competitors and demonstrates asymmetric quality competition favoring lower-quality competitors. Also demonstrated are multiple mechanisms contributing to competitive asymmetries, where dominance involving the otherwise preferred brand is particularly potent (e.g., when a higher-quality, competitor matches the price of an otherwise preferred lower-quality brand). The findings implicate modifications to (1) theories of decision making when extended to repeat choice, (2) empirical models of secondary purchase data, and (3) strategies for positioning and attacking brands. Whereas improving competitive disadvantages often attracts consumers from competitors more than does improving competitive advantages. this benefit must be weighed against the differentiation sacrificed by improving competitive disadvantages (improving competitive advantages,,in contrast, increases differentiation).","['nan', 'REFERENCE DEPENDENCE', 'CONSUMER CHOICE', 'REFERENCE PRICE', 'LOSS AVERSION', 'BRAND CHOICE', 'DECISION', 'SALES', 'PROMOTIONS', 'CONFLICT', 'QUALITY']","['decision', 'sales', 'quality']","['brands', 'competition']",0.0,0.0
"Socially oriented shareholder activism is an increasingly important mechanism through which social movement organizations seek to influence the private sector by exerting pressure on corporate activities in areas such as human rights, environmental protection, and labor policies. This activism challenges the status quo of targeted firms and potentially their institutional field, disrupting business as usual and often drawing negative attention to the firms. We theorize that some firms might use corporate political activity (CPA) as an indirect, nonmarket strategy aimed at regulatory capture to reduce the impact of such disruptions. We focus on one popular avenue of shareholder activismthe proxy proposal mechanismand the role the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays in allowing omission of socially oriented shareholder proposals from the proxy ballot. Using two distinct data sources, we find evidence that for S&P 500 firms, the SEC allows for the omission of the proposals from proxy ballots more frequently for those firms more active in CPA. These findings inform the growing scholarship on socially oriented activism as well as suggest the indirect influence of CPA on government agency decision making.","['corporate political activity', 'social movement organizations', 'regulatory capture', 'SEC', 'CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS', 'SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'PRIVATE POLITICS', 'UNITED-STATES', 'STRATEGY', 'ACCESS', 'GOVERNANCE', 'GOVERNMENT', 'DIRECTORS']","['corporate political activity', 'social movement organizations', 'regulatory capture', 'sec', 'shareholder activism', 'strategy', 'government']","['shareholder activism', 'social movement organizations', 'corporate political activity', 'securities and exchange', 'agency decision making']",0.6,0.42857142857142855
"The authors present a unified strategic framework that enables competing marketing strategy options to be traded off on the basis of projected financial return, which is operationalized as the change in a firm's customer equity relative to the incremental expenditure necessary to produce the change. The change in the firm's customer equity is the change in its current and future customers' lifetime values, summed across all customers in the industry. Each customer's lifetime value results from the frequency of category purchases, average quantity of purchase, and brand-switching patterns combined with the firm's contribution margin. The brand-switching matrix can be estimated from either longitudinal panel data or cross-sectional survey data, using a logit choice model. Firms can analyze drivers that have the greatest impact, compare the drivers' performance with that of competitors' drivers, and project return on investment from improvements in the drivers. To demonstrate how the approach can be implemented in a specific corporate setting and to show the methods used to test and validate the model, the authors illustrate a detailed application of the approach by using data from the airline industry. Their framework enables what-if evaluation of marketing return on investment, which can include such criteria as return on quality, return on advertising, return on loyalty programs, and even return on corporate citizenship, given a particular shift in customer perceptions. This enables the firm to focus marketing efforts on strategic initiatives that generate the greatest return.","['nan', 'ESTIMATION BIAS', 'BRAND CHOICE', 'MODEL', 'QUALITY', 'REGRESSION', 'PROFITABILITY', 'SATISFACTION', 'VARIABLES', 'PROGRAMS', 'DURATION']","['model', 'quality', 'programs']","['marketing strategy options', 'equity', 'return on investment']",0.0,0.0
"What types of relational and institutional mechanisms shape knowledge flows and the upgrading capabilities of emerging-market firms in the face of economic liberalization? We analyze the Argentine autoparts sector to distinguish the relative impact of different types of network relationships on a firm's process and product upgrading. A few social ties to international assemblers appear to be most beneficial for local suppliers, although they may be insufficient to compensate fully for the negative effect of being located in a lower tier. Supplier-customer relationships that are part of regular, disciplined discussions for product and process improvements appear to be especially beneficial for upgrading.

This paper empirically tests and confirms the view that there are systematic ex ante performance differences between firms diversifying into related businesses and firms diversifying into unrelated businesses. These findings imply that ex post performance differences between related and unrelated diversifiers, often reported in previous research, are largely attributable to these ex ante performance differences, not to diversification strategy per se.","['nan', 'CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL OUTCOMES', 'MANAGERIAL DISCRETION', 'ENTROPY MEASURE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MERGERS', 'RISK', 'FIRMS', 'PROFITABILITY', 'INDUSTRY']",['firms'],[],0,0.0

By developing culture-specific propositions for four categories of compensation practices based on status, performance, social benefits and programs, and employee ownership plans, we seek to determine the extent to which Hofstede's four dimensions of culture are associated with specific compensation practices.

"The results of this research demonstrate that boards of directors in venture-capital backed companies are more involved in both strategy formation and evaluation than are boards where members do nor have large ownership stakes. These same results ave demonstrated even when industry, board size, level of diversification, and insider board representation are held constant. Agency theory and institutional theory are advanced as reasons for this higher level of involvement. Venture capitalists are generally seen as value-added investors who have played a significant role in the development of many entrepreneurial businesses (Bygrave and Timmons 1992). This success has lead students of industrial competitiveness like Thurow (1992) to argue that the venture capitalist should serve as an example for directors of all types of organizations. One of the most significant value-added activities of the venture capitalist is involvement with strategy (Fried and Hisrich 1995; MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian 1988; Sapienza 1989, Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir 1996; Rosenstein, Bruno, Bygrave, and Taylor 1993). Implicit in the writings extolling directors who act like venture capitalists (Porter 1992a, 1992b; Bhide 1994; Thurow 1992) is the belief that they will be more active than traditional board members. However, little empirical work has been done to directly compare the level of strategic involvement of the two types of boards. Building on the work of Judge and Zeithaml (1992), this study compares the level of board involvement with strategy by the boards of venture capital-backed companies with the boards of other types of organizations. After establishing different levels of involvement, it then examines why there is a difference. Finally, this study provides additional empirical evidence on the relationship between board involvement and performance (Zahra and Pearce 1989).

Capability possession is critical to gaining competitive advantages and determining firm-level strategies to exploit such advantages. Capability deployment is crucial to mitigating the disadvantages of foreignness and preempting emerging opportunities. Capability upgrading is essential to the evolutionary development of sustainable advantages and creating new bundles of resources.

"Although strategy process research has provided careful and in-depth descriptions and examinations of strategy, micro-level processes and activities have been less commonly evaluated, especially as regards strategy creation and development. This paper examines how managers create and develop strategy in practice. A dual longitudinal case methodology, including a single in-depth study combined with a multiple retrospective study is used, involving four multinational companies. The findings show a twofold character of strategy creation, including fundamental different strategy activities in the periphery and centre, reflecting their diverse location and social embeddedness. Strategy making in the periphery was inductive, including externally oriented and exploratory strategy activities like trial and error, informal noticing, experiments and the use of heuristics. In contrast, strategy making in the centre was more deductive involving an industry and exploitation focus, and activities like planning, analysis, formal intelligence and the use of standard routines.","['nan', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'MODEL', 'FIRM', 'INNOVATION', 'INDUSTRY']",['industry'],[],0,0.0
"Selecting appropriate samples in cultural distance research is vital to producing valid empirical results. Over 80% of empirical cultural distance studies use a sample comprised of either a single home country with varying host countries or a single host country with varying home countries. When difference scores are used in the calculation of cultural distance based on single-country samples the resulting cultural distance measures typically are highly correlated with one or more of the varying countries' underlying national culture dimensions, making it impossible to determine whether findings are due to cultural distance or to varying countries' national culture effects. This is referred to as a confounded variables problem and means that for an overwhelming number of cultural distance studies, we cannot with certainty have confidence in the verity of their findings. To resolve this uncertainty we propose that cultural distance scholars select samples comprised of at least two home/host countries. We empirically demonstrate that two-country samples where most of the national culture dimensions for the two countries differ create certitude with respect to results, eliminating the cultural distance confounded variables problem. We describe the single-country sample problem, illustrate the proposed a priori two-country solution, and suggest avenues for future research.","['cultural distance', 'country samples', 'national culture', 'difference scores', 'confounded variables', 'nan']","['cultural distance', 'country samples', 'national culture', 'difference scores', 'confounded variables']","['cultural distance', 'national culture']",1.0,0.4

"We develop a simulation model to examine conditions under which strategic groups emerge and their performance difference persists. In our model, mobility barriers, strategic interactions among high performers, dynamic capabilities (the mechanisms that allow winners to continue to survive), and boundary of rivalry are put together to derive their joint implications for the evolution of strategic groups. Not surprisingly, our model behavior shows that mobility barriers and strategic interactions play an important role in sustaining intergroup performance difference. However, the extremely high level of mobility barriers is shown to impede the emergence of strategic groups. We also find that dynamic capabilities and boundary of rivalry are as essential as mobility barriers in understanding the emergence and stability of strategic groups. When dynamic capabilities are absent or when rivalry is extended over firms with dissimilar strategies, strategic groups are less likely to exist. These findings can serve as a guideline for empirical research to probe why strategic groups exist sometimes and why they do not at other times.

Data about external technology sourcing transactions in the pharmaceutical industry do not provide evidence for a continuum from less to more integrated sourcing modes.

"Purpose - This paper provides a structured literature review of sustainability in purchasing and supply management, moving beyond the traditional environmental and social sustainability. The paper reviews the concept of sustainability at three levels of inter-organizational analysis - i.e. dyad, supply chain and network. The paper distils the nature and scope of existing research and synthesizes measures used to research sustainability across organizational boundaries. Design/methodology/approach - This literature review systematically analyzes existing literature. In particular, the review focuses on definitions and measures of sustainable purchasing and supply management to obtain an accurate view of current research. Findings - This paper uncovers two distinct trends in the type of research carried out. First, internal or dyadic issues are in focus and second, a tendency to deal with environmental, as opposed to social, sustainability. Despite the need to look beyond the dyad given the risks associated with the extended network, few studies do so in any of the sustainability dimensions. Research limitations/implications - This review is limited by the method employed focusing on definitions and measures. Although the review considers supply chain and network research, it does so purely from a purchasing perspective, thus excluding issues such as logistics and transport. Practical implications - The paper identifies areas open to future research and provides practical insights into how sustainable purchasing and supply are measured. It also synthesizes existing measures of sustainability at different levels and organizes these into a taxonomy. Originality/value - The paper examines studies across multiple levels of analysis and integrates multiple fields of knowledge to show how research on sustainability in purchasing and supply is structured.","['Sustainability', 'Ethical', 'Environmental', 'Purchasing', 'Sourcing', 'Supply chain', 'Network', 'Stakeholders', 'Supply chain management', 'Research', 'CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'GREEN', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'STAKEHOLDERS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PRESSURES', 'STANDARDS', 'FRAMEWORK', 'SERVICES', 'INDUSTRY']","['sustainability', 'environmental', 'purchasing', 'supply chain', 'network', 'research', 'knowledge']","['literature review', 'sustainability', 'purchasing', 'management']",0.5,0.2857142857142857
"Managerial risk taking is a critical aspect of strategic management. To improve competitive advantage and performance, managers need to take risks, often in an uncertain environment. Formal economic assumptions of risk taking suggest that if the expected values for two strategies are similar but one is a greater gamble (uncertain), managers will choose the strategy with a more certain outcome. Based on these assumptions, agency theory assumes that top managers should be compensated or monitored to achieve better outcomes. We review the theory and research on agency theory and managerial risk taking along with theories that challenge this basic assumption about risk taking: the behavioral theory of the firm, prospect theory, the behavioral agency model and the related socioemotional wealth perspective, and upper echelons theory. We contribute to the literature by reviewing and suggesting research opportunities within and across these theories to develop a comprehensive research agenda on managerial risk taking.","['agency theory', 'macro topics', 'behavioral theory of the firm', 'decisions under risk', 'uncertainty', 'top management teams', 'upper echelon', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'TOP-MANAGEMENT-TEAM', 'CEO STOCK-OPTIONS', 'FAMILY-CONTROLLED FIRMS', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'BEHAVIORAL AGENCY', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'SOCIOEMOTIONAL WEALTH', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'ASPIRATION-PERFORMANCE']","['agency theory', 'behavioral theory of the firm', 'upper echelon', 'behavioral agency', 'socioemotional wealth']","['managerial risk taking', 'advantage', 'performance', 'agency theory', 'behavioral theory', 'firm prospect theory', 'behavioral agency model', 'socioemotional wealth', 'upper echelons']",0.2222222222222222,0.4

In line with theoretical predictions, the study shows that downsizing is strongly influenced by industry-specific factors, and it is positively associated with outside, noninstitutional shareholding.

"While boards of directors are usually recognized as having the potential to affect strategic change in organizations, there is considerable debate as to whether such potential is typically realized. We seek to reconcile the debate on whether boards are typically passive vs. active players in the strategy realm by developing a model that specifies when boards are likely to influence organizational strategy and whether such an influence is likely to impel vs. impede change. Specifically, we develop arguments as to when certain demographic and processual features of boards imply a greater inclination for strategic change, when these features imply a greater preference for the status quo, and how differences in such inclinations will influence strategic change. We then also propose that a board's inclination for strategic change interacts with a board's power to affect change, generating a multiplicative effect on strategic change. These ideas are tested using survey and archival data from a national sample of over 3000 hospitals. The supportive findings suggest that strategic change is significantly affected by board demography and board processes, and that these governance effects manifest themselves most strongly in situations where boards are more powerful. We discuss these findings in terms of their relevance for theories of demography, agency, and power.

"A major resource of technological innovativeness is knowledge, which can be either internally or externally derived, and constrained or abundant. We employ a longitudinal case study of U.S. industries to assess whether knowledge sourcesinternal or external to a country's domestic technologyaffect an industry's technological innovativeness, and whether knowledge constraints affect technological innovativeness. We use more than 175,000 U.S. patents over 16 years. In contrast to the prevalent thinking that resource constraints inhibit innovation, we find trade-related knowledge constraints are largely positively associated with the innovativeness of technological output. Moreover, although one may expect a negative relationship between internally derived knowledge based on prior technology and technological innovativeness, we find this relationship is curvilinear.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'PATENT CITATIONS', 'FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS', 'PRODUCT INNOVATION', 'MARKET ENTRY', 'SPILLOVERS', 'IMPACT', 'TRADE', 'GLOBALIZATION']",['trade'],[],0,0.0
"The management of customer switching costs has been hampered by the lack of a comprehensive typology for conceptualizing, categorizing, and measuring consumers' perceptions of these costs. This research develops a switching cost typology that identifies three types of switching costs: (1) procedural switching costs, primarily involving the loss of time and effort; (2) financial switching costs, involving the loss of financially quantifiable resources; and (3) relational switching costs, involving psychological or emotional discomfort due to the loss of identity and the breaking of bonds. The research then examines the antecedents and consequences of switching costs. The results suggest that consumers' perceptions of product complexity and provider heterogeneity, their breadth of product use, and their alternative provider and switching experience drive the switching costs they perceive. Furthermore, all three switching cost types significantly influence consumers' intentions to stay with their current service provider, explaining more variance than does satisfaction.","['switching costs', 'customer satisfaction', 'customer retention', 'customer loyalty', 'customer relationship management', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'COMPETITION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'MODEL', 'INTENTIONS', 'DIMENSIONS', 'ADVANTAGE', 'PRODUCTS', 'PARADIGM', 'BARRIERS']","['switching costs', 'intentions']","['switching costs', 'product complexity']",0.5,0.5
"Strategic alliances with pharmaceutical firms allow small biotechnology firms to acquire needed financial capital in exchange for sharing new, cutting-edge technologies. This study draws from aspects of resource-based view and social capital theory to examine the factors that influence the extent of financial capital biotech firms acquire when forming an alliance with pharmaceutical firms. Using a sample of 184 alliances from the period 1995-2000, we found that alliances where the pharmaceutical firm has greater management control are associated with greater acquisition of financial capital by the biotech firm. We also found that the credibility of the pharmaceutical firm is positively associated with the extent of financial capital acquired by the biotechnology firm and that the number of patents that the biotech firm has is negatively associated to the financial capital the biotech firm receives. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory, research, and management practice.","['nan', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'TECHNOLOGY ALLIANCES', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TRUST', 'GOVERNANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'IMPACT', 'CAPABILITIES', 'UNCERTAINTY']",['strategic alliances'],"['pharmaceutical firms', 'biotechnology', 'view']",0.0,0.0
"U.S. exporters of high-technology, 'dual-use' products are competitively disadvantaged in global markets by the complexity, range, and stringency of U.S. national security export controls. This paper demonstrates that fungibility of high technology and lax interpretation of multilateral export control agreements by other advanced countries have made the existing control regime ineffective. It further shows that persistent U.S. restrictiveness of exports in non-critical, widely available and technologies may needlessly and permanently erode U.S. firms' competitive position in existing as well as rapidly-opening markets worldwide. The need to revise the notion of national security to include not only military security, but also its complement, economic security, is discussed. The pivotal issue of enforceability of multilateral controls is explored, and corporate strategies for U.S. high-tech firms to achieve export control policy change are suggested.","['EXPORT CONTROLS', 'HIGH-TECH FIRMS', 'GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS', 'NATIONAL SECURITY', 'nan']","['export controls', 'high tech firms', 'national security']","['firms', 'economic security']",0.0,0.0
"This research examines the impact of asking intention questions about vice behaviors, or behaviors about which respondents simultaneously hold both negative explicit and positive implicit attitudes. Asking questions about the likelihood of engaging in behaviors for which respondents maintain conflicting attitude structures appears to give respondents a  license to sin, resulting in increased rates of behavior versus those of a control group not asked intention questions. However, when provided with defensive tools that highlight the negative explicit component of their attitudes toward the behaviors, respondents are able to dampen the increase in behavior caused by the act of prediction.","['nan', 'IMPLEMENTATION INTENTIONS', 'PERSUASION ATTEMPTS', 'SELF-CONTROL', 'BEHAVIOR', 'ATTITUDES', 'ACTIVATION', 'COGNITION', 'STEREOTYPES', 'PREDICTION', 'COMPONENTS']","['behavior', 'attitudes', 'prediction']",[],0,0.0
"This paper examines how and under what conditions alliance portfolio diversity influences a firm's innovative performance, with special attention being given to potential performance differences between multinational corporations (MNCs) and domestic firms. Analyses of data from 1045 German firms, among which 598 MNCs, revealed an inverted U-shaped relationship between alliance portfolio diversity and MNCs' innovative performance. Findings also indicate MNCs to be better positioned than their domestic counterparts with regards to translating alliance portfolio diversity into superior innovative performance. Importantly though, this only holds for MNCs equipped with strong internal R&D capabilities and, to some extent, high human capital. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"While organizations and researchers have traditionally conceptualized customers as consumers of their services and products, there is a growing recognition that organizations need to develop more collaborative relationships with clients. In this research, I explore one implication of this shift-how employees respond to client conflicts. In a multi-method qualitative study, I studied patient advocates, hospital employees who mediate conflicts between patients, families, and staff. I develop a process model that shows how mediators construct a web of discrete social interactions that, over time, enables them to develop an empathetic account of the conflict. They then selectively deploy the account to engage in sensegiving. The process model integrates research on emotions and sensemaking in novel ways. I identify how emotion work triggers emotion dynamics in interactions that facilitate or disrupt sensemaking and sensegiving. I show how plausible accounts are developed over the course of social interactions and that mediators pivoted from sensemaking to sensegiving when the account was characterized by empathy. Overall, this research shows how mediators actively generate, interpret, and influence their own and others' emotions, and that mediators' emotion work contributes to the success of collective sensemaking.","['nan', 'MANAGING EMOTIONS', 'LABOR', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'INSTITUTIONS', 'MINDFULNESS', 'COMPASSION', 'STRATEGIES', 'CONFLICT']","['labor', 'organizations', 'conflict']","['model', 'social interactions', 'sensegiving', 'sensemaking', 'empathy']",0.0,0.0
"Drawing on the theoretical insights from the resource-based view of strategic management, this article explores the potential of human resource systems to facilitate or inhibit the development and utilization of organizational competencies. These competencies - managerial, input-based, transformational, and output-based-are presumed to yield sustained competitive advantage for a firm. The competency-based perspective, by focusing attention on the HR activities, functions, and processes that enhance or impede competency accumulation and exploitation, complements the behavioral perspective (Schuler & Jackson, 1987) and, thus, potentially enhances the understanding of strategic human resource management.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'ECONOMIC-ORGANIZATION', 'CORPORATE-STRATEGY', 'MODEL', 'FIRM', 'INFORMATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TURNOVER', 'EXCHANGE']","['strategic management', 'firm']",['competitive advantage'],0.0,0.0
"This study integrated concepts from upper echelons, group process and social cognition theories to investigate holy demographic diversity and group processes influence strategic consensus within the top management team (TMT), where strategic consensus is defined as the degree to which individual mental models of strategy overlap. Data from 76 high-technology firms in the United Stares and Ireland were used to examine three alternative models. The results showed that while demographic diversity alone did have effects on strategic consensus the overall fit of the model was not strong. Adding two intervening group process variables, interpersonal conflict and agreement-seeking, to the model greatly improved the overall relationship with strategic consensus. For the most part, TMT diversity had negative effects on strategic consensus. The model with superior fit showed both direct and indirect effects of diversity on strategic consensus.

This study adopts the host country firm's perspective to investigate the factors that affect Chinese executives' assessments of international joint ventures (IJVs) and divestitures as different modes for engaging inward FDI opportunities. We use an experimental approach to test our argument that executives' preferences for IJVs versus divestitures are driven by multinational firms' resources as well as potential transaction hazards and available remedial mechanisms.

"We compared effects of information about a stereotypical service provider with that about a counterstereotypical service provider on inferences about the similarity of employees within the firm and the firm's similarity to other firms (across-brand differentiation). Our three experiments varied the provider's gender so that it was either stereotypical or counterstereotypical for an occupation. Consistent with previous research, information about a counterstereotypical employee whose behavior violated expectancies decreased the perception of similarity between the individual and other employees compared with when the employee was stereotypical.

"Using change theory integrated with Bourdieusian sociology, we re-theorize a major institutional shift in the field of public accounting. The case we examine involves the consolidation of commercial values in the auditing profession. In reinterpreting this shift, we highlight an institutional process structured around a conflict between commercial innovators and guardians of the professional tradition. Our analysis indicates a peculiar kind of institutional work, wherein economic capital is reinforced at the field level while the logic of commercialism is strengthened in accounting firms' structures and practitioners' mindset. From our studying of the field of accountancy, we develop the concept of institutional experimentation in order to offer a view of institutional work as a fragile and unpredictable process. Specifically, the latter is subject to trials and tests by actors involved in a series of more or less connected experiments in trying to extend their professional jurisdiction through institutional innovation, while seeking to consolidate the traditional foundations of their jurisdictional legitimacy through institutional reproduction. Our paper also challenges the notion of organizational archetypes. While a focus on the firms' formal organizational parameters may suggest archetypical stability, the picture is more complex when one takes into account processes of institutional experimentation and the duality of institutional change and stability.","['Bourdieu', 'change', 'commercialization', 'institutional experimentation', 'institutional work', 'professional service firms', 'RECONSTRUCTED PROFESSIONAL FIRM', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'LAW', 'ORGANIZATION', 'SERVICES', 'CLIENT', 'POWER', 'PRACTITIONERS', 'RATIONALITY']","['bourdieu', 'change', 'institutional experimentation', 'institutional work', 'organization', 'practitioners']","['institutional work', 'firms', 'accountancy', 'experimentation', 'innovation']",0.2,0.16666666666666666

"Previous research on cross-functional integration between research and development (R&D) and marketing has focused on the development of appropriate structural modes and levels of integration and cooperation across the R&D-marketing interface. A gap in the previous research in this area has been the failure to investigate the integration of information from past related product development projects (i.e., knowledge management). In this investigation of R&D-marketing integration, variables from the emerging research literature on organizational learning and knowledge management are examined. By simultaneously investigating the effects of knowledge management variables and R&D-marketing integration, this gap in the literature is addressed. The results demonstrate that the combined effects of R&D-marketing integration and knowledge management in the form of recording, retrieving, and reviewing information from past projects results in interaction effects. In 8 of 18 tests interactions were found. In 6 of 18 tests these resulted in the form of amplification effects with dependent variables such as product prototype development proficiency, product launch proficiency, technological core competency fit, and design change frequency.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'D MARKETING INTERFACE', 'HIGH-TECHNOLOGY FIRMS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL IMPROVISATION', 'WORK CHARACTERISTICS', 'INNOVATION PROJECTS', 'ELECTRONICS FIRMS', 'CYCLE TIME', 'SUCCESS', 'IMPACT']","['research and development', 'd marketing interface']",['knowledge management'],0.0,0.0
"This study shows how spatial information about product supply and demand can be used to determine the geographic extent of markets. It demonstrates that markets thus defined allow finer-grained measurement of competitive conditions than is possible using conventional approaches. Two procedures are developed and contrasted: one, called a natural market approach, is drawn from the Industrial Organization economics literature; the second, called an enactment approach, is associated with the open systems perspective on organizations. Applied to a set of hospitals in the San Francisco Bay area, geographic market boundaries established in these ways are shown to lead to finely defined markets, and to reveal strong variation in competitive conditions across the area-variation not detectable if conventional approaches to market definition are used. It is shown that these approaches have applications beyond geographic market definition, and can also be applied to define markets in terms of product or service types.","['MARKETS', 'COMPETITION', 'HOSPITALS', 'ENACTMENT', 'MARKET BOUNDARIES', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'COST']","['markets', 'hospitals', 'enactment', 'market boundaries', 'organizations']",[],0,0.0
"Purpose Tragic incidents such as the Rana Plaza building collapse call into question the value and effectiveness of supplier codes of conduct (SCC) used in multi-tier supply chains. This paper aims to investigate the barriers to sub-supplier compliance and the drivers from the perspective of suppliers that adopt a double agency role by complying with buyer-imposed SCC while managing sub-supplier compliance on behalf of the buyer. Design/methodology/approach This research adopts a sequential, mixed-methods approach. The qualitative phase develops a conceptual model with the aid of the extant the literature and semi-structured interviews with 24 senior manufacturing professionals. The quantitative phase then uses a hierarchical regression analysis to test the conceptual model using survey data from 159 apparel suppliers based in India. Findings The findings reveal that sub-supplier compliance is positively impacted by effective buyer-supplier governance and by the focal supplier having a strategic partnership with the sub-supplier. Conversely, price pressure on sub-suppliers adversely impacts their compliance, while institutional pressure on them to comply is generally ineffective. Research limitations/implications The context of the study is limited to the garment industry in India. Practical implications To improve SCC compliance rates, buyers and focal suppliers should actively develop strategic partnerships with selected upstream supply chain actors; should set a reasonable price across the supply chain; and, should include specific sub-supplier compliance requirements within the supply contract. The findings also suggest the need to develop social sustainability protocols that are cognisant of regional contexts. Originality/value The absence of prior research on SCC implementation by sub-suppliers, this study represents a pioneering empirical study into such multi-tier sourcing arrangements. It provides strong support that sub-supplier governance arrangements differ from those typically found in the focal supplier layer. It also provides empirical evidence of the critical factors that encourage sub-supplier compliance within the apparel industry of a regionally developing economy.","['India', 'Sustainability', 'Garment industry', 'Empirical study', 'Suppliers', 'MIXED METHODS RESEARCH', 'CHAIN MANAGEMENT', 'INSTITUTIONAL PRESSURES', 'STAKEHOLDER PRESSURE', 'RESPONSIBILITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'BUYER', 'GOVERNANCE', 'BUSINESS', 'ADOPTION']","['india', 'sustainability', 'garment industry', 'empirical study', 'suppliers', 'buyer', 'governance']","['codes of conduct', 'compliance', 'double agency', 'india', 'governance']",0.4,0.2857142857142857
"Does asking people about their future behavior increase or decrease the likelihood that they will repeat their past behavior? In two laboratory and two field experiments, we find that behavior prediction strengthens behavior repetition, making people more likely to do what they normally do, when personal norms regarding engaging in a behavior are weak or not easily accessible. However, when personal norms are strong or made accessible at the time of the prediction request, behavior prediction weakens behavior repetition and increases the likelihood that people do what they think they should do-even if it's not what they normally would do. These findings provide new tools for influencing behavior repetition, reconcile some seemingly contradictory past findings, and contribute to the debate regarding the relative importance of habits and intentions in guiding behavior.","['nan', 'SELF-GENERATED VALIDITY', 'MEASURING INTENT', 'REASONED ACTION', 'PROPHECY', 'PURCHASE', 'HABITS', 'SUSCEPTIBILITY', 'QUESTIONS', 'REQUESTS', 'ATTITUDE']",['habits'],[],0,0.0
"Four theories on the economic rationale for warranty provision have been proposed in the literature: (1) Warranties provide insurance to customers and work as a risk-sharing mechanism, (2) warranties are a sorting mechanism and work as a means for second-degree price discrimination among customers with different risk preferences, (3) warranties work as a signal of product quality to consumers under information asymmetry, and (4) warranties work as an incentive mechanism for firms to reveal and improve product quality. The authors examine the conditions under which each theory would apply and derive testable implications from the data. They then assess whether these theories have empirical support in the U.S. computer server and automobile markets in the context of manufacturer base warranties. The results indicate that in both markets, warranties primarily provide customers with insurance against product failure, and warranties of different durations work as a sorting mechanism across customers with different levels of risk aversion. Warranties are not used to signal product quality or to provide an incentive for manufacturers to reveal or improve product quality.","['warranties', 'insurance', 'sorting', 'signaling', 'incentives', 'second-degree price discrimination', 'server market', 'automobile market', 'PRODUCT QUALITY', 'RISK ATTITUDE', 'MORAL HAZARD', 'CONSUMER', 'RELIABILITY', 'SIGNALS', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'INFORMATION', 'CONTRACTS']","['warranties', 'insurance', 'sorting', 'second degree price discrimination', 'automobile market', 'product quality', 'consumer', 'information']","['quality', 'information asymmetry']",0.0,0.0
"Strategy, whatever its different definitions, entails an attempt by a firm to achieve and sustain competitive advantage against other firms. Competitive advantage can be achieved if the firm is able to be different. Success is based on using a unique strategy. Success is defined as the ability to gain abnormal profits, not simply to stay alive in a competitive industry. The ability to protect the uniqueness against imitators ensures continued success. Strategy theory research is diverse, and can be divided into distinct schools of thought. Certain researchers describe the process of strategy formation. Others are prescriptive, concerned with analytical tools for strategy formulation. Among strategy content researchers, much recent research concentrates on industry analysis techniques. Since strategy is defined as the ability to gain an advantage, a cross-sectional study of industry conditions can show the constraints on such a strategy, but is far less useful in defining how to achieve and sustain a competitive advantage. A critical aspect in understanding competitive advantage is that of the identification of firm-specific advantages, particularly in an outlying rather than the average 'representative' firm. The process by which managers of such firms gain insights on strategic vision often affects the results. This article calls for understanding the unique or - as a minimum - learning to recognize uniqueness (e.g. as someone running a venture fund reviewing proposals for investment). It is concerned with how a strategy can be evaluated ex ante by outsiders to predict its probability of success. The strategy research field is not mature enough to settle on only some conceptual boxes. The article also calls for several accepted modes of investigation, including history and political behaviour, to understand better the process by which firms attempt to achieve unique advantages and the evolution of resource deployment.","['nan', 'STRATEGIC GROUPS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'POPULATION ECOLOGY', 'MOBILITY BARRIERS', 'LEARNING-CURVE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INDUSTRY', 'INVESTMENT']","['competitive advantage', 'industry', 'investment']","['competitive advantage', 'firms']",0.5,0.3333333333333333
"P>While there is continual scholarly interest in the 'organization as theatre' metaphor, extant dramaturgical perspectives limit the ability to account for aesthetic experiences in theatrical situations. This study provides a different methodological lens for looking at 'theatre' in organizations and illustrates that an inclusion of performance theory can be particularly valuable for understanding aesthetic techniques which are increasingly employed in organizations. Responding to calls for aesthetic studies, this article analyses large-scale management presentations such as annual general meetings, press conferences, and analyst meetings 'as performance' instead of re-labelling them as if they were drama. Drawing on the latest theatre theory and introducing a tool for performance analysis, the study accounts for the aesthetic experience and describes the complex interplay of scenography, lighting, clothing, managers' performance style, rhetoric, and audience interaction, showing that these organizational events are co-created and contested theatrical performances with a potential for resistance and possible change as well as for persuasion.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL AESTHETICS', 'IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT', 'THEATER', 'LOOKING']",['looking'],[],0,0.0

"To explain the question-behavior effect, that is, the effect of answering an intention question on subsequent behavior, this article takes on a motivational perspective and proposes that answering an intention question automatically activates an intention. The activation of this motivational state influences subsequent brand choices due to changes in brand accessibilities. Three studies provide support for the assumption that responding to an intention question affects brand choices through a motivational mechanism, such that (1) answering an intention increases the accessibility of motivation-related information and decreases the accessibility of motivation-competing information which increases the choice for the intentionrelated brand; (2) intention completion temporarily reverses the foregoing accessibility patterns, instigating a reversal of the brand choices for an immediate, second brand choice; and (3) the changes in brand accessibilities and thus the behavioral effect persist as the delay between the intention question and brand choice occasion increases until intention completion.","['nan', 'SELF-GENERATED VALIDITY', 'MEASURING INTENT', 'DISTRACTING STIMULI', 'ASKING QUESTIONS', 'CHOICE', 'BRAND', 'GOAL', 'ACTIVATION', 'MERE', 'ACCESSIBILITY']","['choice', 'brand', 'activation', 'accessibility']","['brand choices', 'brand accessibilities']",0.0,0.0
"The authors conduct a meta-analysis on the effect of electronic word of mouth on sales by examining 51 studies (involving 339 volume and 271 valence elasticities) and primary data collected on product characteristics (durability, trialability, and usage condition), industry characteristics (industry growth and competition), and platform characteristics (expertise and trustworthiness). Their analysis reveals that electronic word-of-mouth volume (valence) elasticity is .236 (.417). More importantly, the findings show that volume and valence elasticities are higher for privately consumed, low-trialability products that operate in less competitive industries and whose reviews are carried on independent review sites. Furthermore, volume elasticities are higher for durable goods and for reviews on specialized review sites, whereas valence elasticities are greater for community-based sites. Drawing on the results, they discuss several implications for managers and researchers and explain why valence elasticities are often found to be insignificant.

"This paper explores conflicting implications of firm-specific human capital (FSHC) for firm performance. Existing theory predicts a productivity effect that can be enhanced with strong incentives. We propose an offsetting agency effect: FSHC may facilitate more-sophisticated 'gaming' of incentives, to the detriment of firm performance. Using a unique dataset from a multiunit retail bank, we document both effects and estimate their net impact. Managers with superior FSHC are more productive in selling loans but are also more likely to manipulate loan terms to increase incentive payouts. We find that resulting profits are two percentage points lower for high-FSHC managers. Finally, profit losses increase more rapidly for high-FSHC managers, indicating adverse learning. Our results suggest that FSHC can create agency costs that outweigh its productive benefits.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contrast traditional transaction-based supply chain strategies with emerging relationship-based strategies in human resource and organizational areas. Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical framework is proposed based on the relationship of human resource variables (staffing, training, evaluation, and compensation) and organization variables (structure, culture, and empowerment strategies) with supply chain integration and performance. Findings - A model is presented of the relationship of human resource and organization variables with supply chain integration and performance. Propositions are posited and conclusions are noted with suggestions for further research. Research limitations/implications - The paper is clearly only theoretical. Much empirical testing is yet to be done. Originality/value - The paper is among the first to focus the relationships of human resource strategies and organization variables with supply chain integration and performance. While the structuring and measurement of integrated global supply chain flows, particularly of the hard products, services, and information, are well established, much less is understood concerning the contribution of such soft areas as human resource management activities and organization variables.","['Supply chain management', 'Human resource management', 'Organizational structures', 'Organization culture', 'Empowerment', 'FIT']","['human resource management', 'empowerment']",['integration'],0.0,0.0
"The objective of this paper is to examine the impacts of experience intensity, experience diversity and acquisitive experience on the development of selection and valuation capabilities that help the parent (investor) company generate higher short-term financial returns and improve long-term strategic performance. Based on our analysis of 2110 cases of CVC investments in the VenureXpert data base, we find that industry diversity of a CVC program's experience is positively related to its selection of portfolio companies with relatively high financial potential. The CVC program's experience intensity, stage diversity of its experience, and syndication improve its selection of portfolio companies with greater strategic potential. In addition, stage diversity may enhance valuation capability. We also find that experience accumulation is more effective when a CVC program invests in a portfolio company in the later stage rather than in the early stage. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

"We investigated the status of leadership theory integration by reviewing 14 years of published research (2000 through 2013) in 10 top journals (864 articles). The authors of these articles examined 49 leadership approaches/theories, and in 293 articles, 3 or more of these leadership approaches were included in their investigations. Focusing on these articles that reflected relatively extensive integration, we applied an inductive approach and used graphic network analysis as a guide for drawing conclusions about the status of leadership theory integration. All 293 articles included in the analysis identified 1 focal theory that was integrated with 2 or more supporting leadership theories. The 6 leadership approaches most often appearing as the focal theory were transformational leadership, charismatic leadership, strategic leadership, leadership and diversity, participative/shared leadership, and the trait approach to leadership. On the basis of inductive reflections on our analysis, we make two key observations. First, the 49 focal leadership theories qualify as middle-range theories that are ripe for integration.

"This paper examines foundings of human services organizations after natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes, and tsunamis and explains why only some communities bounce back by founding appropriate collective-goods organizations. Using natural disasters in California counties from 1990 to 2010 as shocks that exogenously impose a need for collective goods over and above the level endogenous to the community, this paper shows that a geographic community's local organizing capacity rests on the richness of its repertoire of voluntary organizing models as reflected in the diversity of its voluntary associations. Such diversity is even more critical when the type of natural disaster is more unexpected or complex (e.g., both a wildfire and an earthquake) in an area, and the organizational challenges posed are thus more novel for the community. Associational diversity has positive effects on both the numbers and aggregate size of foundings of local (non-branch, secular) human services organizations, and the effects are generalizable to other endogenous demand conditions such as poverty. Results also show how different kinds of variety can have opposing effects on organizing capacity after a disaster, with associational diversity having a positive effect, political diversity having a negative effect, and racial diversity having no significant effect, net of other factors. The paper concludes with a call for treating community resilience as a matter of enhancing local organizing capacity over centralized planning efforts when the environment is rapidly changing.","['social capital', 'entrepreneurship', 'organizational forms', 'social movements', 'non-profits', 'natural disasters', 'social entrepreneurship', 'associational diversity', 'community resilience', 'organizations and the natural environment', 'disaster management', 'COMMUNITY', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'SEGREGATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'GOVERNMENT', 'PRIVATE', 'CONFLICT', 'BUSINESS', 'IMPACTS', 'ORIGINS']","['natural disasters', 'associational diversity', 'community resilience', 'community', 'organizations']","['human services organizations', 'natural disasters', 'collective goods', 'organizing']",0.25,0.2
"We argue that companies may enter foreign environments either incrementally, as suggested by long-established theory, or by taking larger steps that may result in lower initial performance but, through learning and experience, lead to increased performance in future expansions. This idea is corroborated by the experience of Dutch companies entering into Central and Eastern Europe. We also find that expansion steps may be too large, thereby limiting the exploration of foreign environments.

"Adopting an interpersonal communication perspective, this study examines the propositions that a salesperson's touch increases trust, which increases product evaluations and purchase intention. These relationships are evaluated in a contact and non-contact culture, with need for touch (NFT) examined as an additional moderator. An exploratory series of in-depth interviews provides an initial understanding of these relationships, followed by a 2 (touch/no touch condition) x 2 (consumers in France/Germany) experiment with wine serving as the example category. The findings indicate that touch does not uniformly instill trust in customers. Instead a salesperson's touch relates to greater trust only when consumers have an inherent NFT or when they are from a culture where personal touching behavior is less prevalent. Trust, in turn, relates positively to evaluations of product attractiveness, quality, and to purchase intention. (C) 2013 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"With the rapid development of e-commerce, many manufacturers today are opting to open an online channel to engage in direct online sales, which leads to intense channel competition with retailers. It is managerially important for both the manufacturer and the retailer to develop some cooperative mechanisms to improve channel coordination. Our research focuses on the strategic role played by cooperative advertising in the dual-channel competition of the manufacturer-retailer supply chain. We use a game-theoretical model to show that a cooperative advertising program can be utilized as an effective coordinative mechanism to alleviate dual-channel competition and thus help to improve the channel as a whole and the individual channel members' performance. Depending on different product compatibilities with the Web, the retailer's investment and the manufacturer's participation rate in the cooperative advertising program will also be different. When the product has strong Web compatibility, retailers invest more in cooperative advertising and the manufacturer needs to contribute a high participation rate. When product compatibility with the Web is weak, the retailer's investment on cooperative advertising is small and the manufacturer's participation rate is low. However, when a product enjoys an overwhelming advantage in being sold online over the traditional channel, the value of a cooperative advertising program vanishes.","['Marketing strategies', 'multichannel commerce', 'e-tail', 'cooperative advertising', 'channel coordination', 'game theory', 'E-COMMERCE', 'COORDINATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL']","['cooperative advertising', 'channel coordination', 'e commerce', 'coordination', 'performance', 'model']","['commerce', 'channel coordination', 'cooperative advertising', 'cooperative advertising', 'web compatibility']",0.4,0.3333333333333333

"Establishing the applicability of multi-item measures is important for making valid inferences when testing theories cross-nationally. Typically, researchers have relied upon the tenets of classical measurement theory (CT) using confirmatory factor model invariance testing to conclude that a unidimensional measure is applicable across countries. However, two important issues remain unresolved via CT techniques: (1) if the measure is found not to be invariant, CT tells us little as to why the measure varies across countries; and (2) if the measure is multi-dimensional, what factors affect its cross-national applicability? Our research seeks to address these issues and the cross-national measurement applicability of multi-dimensional scales via generalizability theory (GT). In this paper, we use a cross-national data set and simulated data sets to demonstrate the usefulness of GT to cross-national multidimensional measurement.","['measurement', 'cross-cultural', 'scale validation', 'generalizability theory', 'ISSUES', 'VALIDITY']","['measurement', 'generalizability theory', 'issues']","['item measures', 'classical measurement theory', 'multi dimensional scales', 'generalizability theory', 'multidimensional measurement']",0.2,0.3333333333333333
"The purpose of this research was to examine whether a firm's learning capability interacts with industry technological parity to predict innovation mode use. Learning capability is conceptualized in the current research as a firm's ability to develop or acquire the new knowledge-based resources and skills needed to offer new products. Industry technological parity is conceptualized as the extent to which similarity and equality exist among the technological competencies of the firms in an industry. Three generic modes of innovation are considered: internal, cooperative, and external innovation. These modes reflect the development of new products based solely on internal resources, the collaborative development of new products (i.e., with one or more development partners), and the acquisition of fully developed products from external sources, respectively. The premises of this research are that (1) technological parity can create incentives or disincentives for innovating in a particular mode, depending upon the value of external innovative resources relative to the value of internal innovative resources and (2) firms will choose innovation modes that reflect a combination of their abilities and incentives to innovate alone, with others, or through others. Survey research and secondary sources were used to collect data from 119 high-technology firms. Results indicate that firms exhibit greater use of internal and external innovation when high levels of industry technological parity are matched by high levels of firm learning capability. By contrast, a negative relationship between learning capability and industry technological parity is associated with greater use of the cooperative mode of innovation. Thus, a single, common internal capability-learning capability-interacts with the level of technological parity in the environment to significantly predict three distinct innovation modes-modes that are not inherently dependent upon one another. As such, a firm's internal ability to innovate, as reflected in learning capability, has relevance well beyond that firm's likely internal innovation output. It also predicts the firm's likely use of cooperative and external innovation when considered in light of the level of industry technological parity. A practical implication of these findings is that companies with modest learning capabilities are not inherently precluded from innovating. Rather, they can innovate through modes for which conditions in their current environments do not constitute significant obstacles to innovation output. In particular, modest learning capabilities are associated with higher innovative output in the internal, cooperative, and external modes when industry technological parity levels are low, high, and low, respectively. Conversely, strong learning capabilities tend to be associated with higher innovative output in the internal, cooperative, and external modes when industry technological parity levels are high, low, and high, respectively.","['nan', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION', 'FIRM RESOURCES', 'PRODUCT', 'COLLABORATION', 'MARKET', 'BIOTECHNOLOGY', 'ACQUISITIONS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERSPECTIVE']",['product'],['knowledge'],0.0,0.0
"The idea that R&D professionals typically spend a considerable amount of their time working as members of teams makes sense. After all, plenty of research indicates that the use of cross-functional teams improves the effectiveness of product development efforts. However, the increasing use of cross-functional teams raises an important question for researchers and R&D practitioners: Does the use of cross-functional teams improve the quality of work life for technical professionals? Rene Cordero, George F. Farris, and Nancy DiTomaso address this question in study of 1,714 R&D professionals working on projects. They suggest that being a member of a cross-functional team may be more demanding than working as a member of a functional project group. On the other hand, they expect that working on a cross-functional project team may be more rewarding than working in a functional project group. Their study tests these hypotheses by examining the relationships between measures of the extent to which respondents work on cross-functional teams and five measures each of the participants' job demands and positive job outcomes. The study identifies positive relationships between working on cross-functional teams and the five positive job outcomes standard: job growth, job security, membership in successful teams, earning money, and job satisfaction. The study finds less consistent ann weaker relationships between working on cross-functional teams and the five job demands studied. Specifically, the study identifies positive relationships between working on cross-functional teams and the following job demands: effort, job involvement, and considering a lot of difference of opinion. The results of this study do not find a conclusive rt relationship between cross-functional team membership and time pressure. And contrary to expectations, the study finds a negative relationship between working on cross-functional teams and job stress. Comparing the responses of participants who work on project teams with those who cio not, the results of the study indicate that respondents who work on project teams face greater job demands than positive job outcomes. However, working on cross-functional teams seems to increase positive job outcomes more than job demands. In other words, working on cross-functional teams appears to increase the quality of work life for the technical professionals in this study.

"Creative work is a social process that requires effective collaboration between individuals. Accordingly, theories account for the ways creativity takes place in teams and groups and the role that social networks play in shaping creativity. However, scholars have largely overlooked the role that dyads play in creative work within organizations. This article builds theory on how intimate co-creation occurs and how it influences the generation of creative ideas over time. I theorize that as people create together, they engage in intimate creative interactions, which under certain circumstances lead to the development of a shared interpersonal boundary (i.e., a sense of we). This shared interpersonal boundary influences creativity by circumscribing a closed, safe space in which the dyad can explore divergent ideas and manage the paradoxes of creativity; it also enables shared scripts and schemas that help the dyad move through creative blocks. By integrating theories of intimate interactions, psychological ownership, and interpersonal relationships, this article advances our understanding of how dyads-specifically, intimate co-creation-influence creative work.","['nan', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP', 'PRODUCTIVITY LOSS', 'SELF-DISCLOSURE', 'POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS', 'BRAINSTORMING GROUPS', 'INTEGRATIVE MODEL', 'WORK', 'INNOVATION', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'IDENTITY']","['psychological ownership', 'work', 'organizations']","['creative work', 'co creation', 'psychological ownership']",0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333

"This research investigates the impact of a sales team's entitativity-the extent to which a group of individuals is perceived as a unified single entity-on customer satisfaction. Four studies demonstrate that a sales team entitativity cue, either based on appearance (e.g., wearing the same outfit) or based on behavior (e.g., explicit coordination in service), leads to heightened perceptions of service quality, which subsequently enhances customer satisfaction. Further, these two entitativity cues are shown to have interactive effects. Specifically, when both cues indicate high entitativity, customer satisfaction with the sales team exceeds the average evaluation of individual team members. However, if at least one cue suggests low entitativity (e.g., different outfits or no explicit coordination), the positive influence of the entitativity cue is undermined and customer satisfaction with the team's service is mitigated. Product category is identified as an important moderator of the main effect.","['Sales team', 'Entitativity', 'Service quality', 'Customer satisfaction', 'MEASURING SERVICE QUALITY', 'SELLING TEAMS', 'SALESPERSON', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DETERMINANTS', 'COORDINATION', 'INDIVIDUALS']","['sales team', 'entitativity', 'service quality', 'customer satisfaction', 'perceptions', 'coordination', 'individuals']","['entitativity', 'customer satisfaction', 'coordination', 'service quality']",1.0,0.5714285714285714
"The authors review the progress of three rapidly growing macro management literatures-in technology innovation, entrepreneurship, and strategic management-that have in common the use of a demand-side research perspective. Demand-side research looks downstream from the focal firm, toward product markets and consumers, to explain and predict those managerial decisions that increase value creation within a value system. Typical characteristics of demand-side, macro-level management research include clearly distinguishing value creation from value capture, emphasizing product markets as key sources of value-creation strategies for firms, viewing consumer preferences as dynamic and sometimes latent, and recognizing that managers' differing decisions in response to consumer heterogeneity contribute to firm heterogeneity and, ultimately, value creation. The authors review recent demand-side findings showing that strategies based on consumer heterogeneity can result in competitive advantage even if the firm holds only obsolete or mundane resources, these advantages can be sustainable without resource- or ability-based barriers to imitation, successful innovations can be consumer driven rather than resource or technology driven, and consumer knowledge can play a key role in entrepreneurial idea discovery. These seemingly counterintuitive findings from demand-side research indicate the promise of future demand-side work for generating new knowledge useful to scholars and managers. The authors suggest directions for future demand-side research based on their review. What's more, the research they review represents a start-but only a start-toward integrated theories that could attend to both the demand side and the producer side of the value creation equation.","['demand side', 'technology innovation', 'entrepreneurship', 'strategic management', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'VALUE CREATION', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'USEFUL PERSPECTIVE', 'RESEARCH AGENDA', 'CUSTOMER VALUE', 'FIRM', 'PERFORMANCE']","['demand side', 'technology innovation', 'entrepreneurship', 'strategic management', 'value creation', 'competitive advantage', 'firm']","['value creation', 'value capture']",0.5,0.14285714285714285
"Work-family interface conflicts have typically been cast in a negative light due to their detrimental consequences. This study offers new insights by uncovering conditions under which such conflicts may produce both positive and negative effects on salesperson job-related behaviors in the context of B2B sales. Drawing on cognitive appraisal theory as an overarching theoretical framework, the authors suggest that informal controls (i.e., professional control and self-control) have differential moderating effects in salespeople's primary and secondary appraisal processes when faced with work-family conflict and family-work conflict. Dyadic data from a matched salesperson-customer sample reveals that professional control amplifies, whereas self-control mitigates, the positive effect of work-family conflict on perceived stress. Professional control amplifies the positive effect of stress on in-role behavior, and self-control strengthens positive effects of stress on in-role behavior and customer-directed extra-role behavior while suppressing unethical behavior under high stress. Moreover, the two types of informal controls moderate the direct effects of family-work conflict on salesperson behaviors in an opposite fashion, such that under a strong professional control, family-work conflict reduces in-role and extra-role behaviors and induces unethical behavior, whereas a strong self-control alleviates such detrimental effects. These findings suggest that work-family interface conflicts should be viewed as a double-edged sword capable of producing both positive and negative consequences under certain conditions, offering new theoretical insights and important managerial implications for this prevalent phenomenon in sales management.","['Work-family conflict', 'Family-work conflict', 'Professional control', 'Self-control', 'Work stress', 'In-role behavior', 'Customer-directed extra-role behavior', 'Unethical behavior', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'JOB-RELATED OUTCOMES', 'ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR', 'COGNITIVE APPRAISAL', 'CUSTOMER SERVICE', 'STRESS', 'SATISFACTION', 'SALESPEOPLE', 'DEMANDS', 'VARIABLES']","['work family conflict', 'family work conflict', 'professional control', 'self control', 'in role behavior', 'customer directed extra role behavior', 'unethical behavior', 'cognitive appraisal', 'stress', 'salespeople']","['family interface conflicts', 'behaviors', 'cognitive appraisal', 'informal controls', 'professional control', 'self control', 'perceived stress', 'in role behavior', 'extra role behavior']",0.4444444444444444,0.4

"Building on an inductive, qualitative study of independent workers-people not affiliated with an organization or established profession-this paper develops a theory about the management of precarious and personalized work identities. We find that in the absence of organizational or professional membership, workers experience stark emotional tensions encompassing both the anxiety and fulfillment of working in precarious and personal conditions. Lacking the holding environment provided by an organization, the workers we studied endeavored to create one for themselves through cultivating connections to routines, places, people, and a broader purpose. These personal holding environments helped them manage the broad range of emotions stirred up by their precarious working lives and focus on producing work that let them define, express, and develop their selves. Thus holding environments transformed workers' precariousness into a tolerable and even generative predicament. By clarifying the process through which people manage emotions associated with precarious and personalized work identities, and thereby render their work identities viable and their selves vital, this paper advances theorizing on the emotional underpinnings of identity work and the systems psychodynamics of independent work.","['work identity', 'emotion management', 'holding environments', 'gig economy', 'independent workers', 'systems psychodynamics', 'individual agency', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY', 'SELF', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'EMOTION', 'IMAGE', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'EXPERIENCES']","['holding environments', 'independent workers', 'systems psychodynamics', 'emotion']","['identity work', 'psychodynamics']",0.0,0.0
"Integrating the behavioral theory of the firm (the BTF) and the self-enhancement motive of managers, this paper examines how performance feedback the discrepancy between actual performance and aspiration levels affects the international expansion of emerging economy firms (EEFs). Empirical results using panel data on 876 publicly-listed Chinese manufacturing companies over a 7-year period indicate that performance relative to social aspiration (i.e., peer performance) and relative to historical aspiration (i.e., firms' own past performance) affects EEFs' levels of subsequent outward foreign direct investment (OFDI). Specifically, performance below social or historical aspiration enhances levels of OFDI, while the effect of performance below social aspiration is stronger than that of underperforming historical results. The results also show that performance above social aspiration enhances levels of OFDI, while performance above historical aspiration decreases levels of OFDI. Moreover, we uncover the importance of considering the joint effect of historical and social performance feedback, as receiving consistent or mixed signals about firm performance may result in risk-taking behaviors that differ from those triggered by just one performance signal on its own.

"Employing a social construction perspective, this article argues that entrepreneurs are uniquely empowered by entrepreneurial discourse to bring about creative destruction. Analysis of the representation of entrepreneurship in the media suggests that entrepreneurs have a distinctive presence in society that is shaped by cultural norms and expectations.

The results of two large-scale, multilevel investigations involving data from three different levels (customers, employees, and managers) demonstrate the importance of CNK for the provision of customer satisfaction and customer value. In particular, CNK fully mediates the influence of employees' customer orientation and cognitive empathy on these customer outcomes.

"As exemplary instruments of relationship marketing, loyalty programs are being implemented and studied at an unprecedented rate. Yet real-world efforts often fail-or at least do not live up to expectations-and despite the growing richness of loyalty program literature, the field remains fragmented. Thus, a comprehensive perspective is required. To guide further research and suggest ways that managers might improve loyalty program effectiveness, this article synthesizes insights on loyalty programs from empirical research and underlying psychological theories. The proposed conceptual model of loyalty program effectiveness consists of psychological, design, and operational elements; in turn, it suggests a set of 12 propositions that account for differential effects across customer acquisition, onboarding, expansion, and retention stages. With an evolving theory of loyalty programs across relationship dynamics, this propositional inventory parsimoniously delineates the trade-offs associated with relationship stage-based management of these programs.

"Regardless of the apparent need for product eliminations, many managers hesitate to act as they fear deleterious effects on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Other managers do carry out product eliminations, but often fail to consider the consequences for customers and business relationships. Given the relevance and problems of product eliminations, research on this topic in general and on the consequences for customers and business relationships in particular is surprisingly scarce. Therefore, this empirical study explores how and to what extent the elimination of a product negatively affects customers and business relationships. Results indicate that eliminating a product may result in severe economic and psychological costs to customers, thereby seriously decreasing customer satisfaction and loyalty. This paper also shows that these costs are not exogenous in nature. Instead, depending on the characteristics of the eliminated product these costs are found to be more or less strongly driven by a company's behavior when implementing the elimination at the customer interface.","['Product elimination', 'Product removal', 'Product portfolio management', 'Product management', 'Product policy', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'SERVICE QUALITY', 'TRANSACTION-COST', 'SATISFACTION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'STRATEGIES', 'MANAGEMENT', 'DELETION', 'MARKET', 'FIRM']","['product elimination', 'satisfaction', 'behavior']",['customer satisfaction'],0.0,0.0

Notably, we further clarify why interpersonal trust between organizational boundary spanners does not translate into inter-organizational trust and why inter-organizational trust is often based upon processes. Second, the paper briefly discusses relevant research on inter-firm trust since 2000, noting that research has shown the contingent value of trust, and notably that it is more important when asset specificity and uncertainty are high. Third, we discuss what has happened in the automotive industry over the past 15 years with regard to trust in supplier buyer relationships. We show a correlation between automaker trustworthiness and automaker market-share performance and suggest a causal link, since some automakers (e.g., Hyundai, Kia) have been increasing trust with suppliers and then improving market performance. Finally, the retrospective discusses opportunities for future research on the topic of trust in inter-organizational relationships.

"Research summary:Mental models, reflecting interdependencies among managerial choice variables, are not always correctly specified. Mental models can be underspecified, missing interdependencies, or overspecified, containing nonexistent interdependencies. Using a simulation model, we find that under- and overspecification have opposite effects on exploration, and thereby, performance. The effects are also opposite, depending on whether a manager controls all choice variables. The mechanism underlying our results is a feedback loop: misspecified mental models influence managerial learning about the effectiveness of choices; this learning guides how the environment is explored, which in turn, affects which information will be generated for future learning. We explore implications of these results for strategic management and introduce the notion of cognitive fit between the mental model of the decision-maker and the strategic environment.Managerial summary:Managers often rely on mental models to guide their decision-making. These mental models, however, are often misspecified, that is, more or less complex than the situation managers are facing. Using a simulation model, we study the consequences of such misspecified mental models. We find that the performance implications of misspecified mental models crucially depend on whether the manager controls all choice variables. We identify situations in which simpler mental models are better than overly complex ones, and vice versa.

"Nearly three decades of research on mentoring has offered empirically supported processes in developing a mentoring relationship. Yet the application of mentoring within family businesses has received little exploration. Since much of the current mentoring literature is focused on general workplace mentoring, it is not clear how the multidimensional and interdependent systems within family businesses might complicate the translation of the existing literature to family business populations. This study examines interorganizational family business mentoring relationships to determine whether there are any issues which differentiate it from the existing mentoring research findings.","['mentor', 'qualitative', 'next generation', 'protege', 'leadership development', 'BENEFITS']",['mentor'],"['mentoring', 'family businesses']",0.0,0.0
"New products provide increased sales, profits, and competitive strength for most organizations. However, nearly 50% of the new products that are introduced each year fail. Organizations thus find themselves in a double bind. On the one hand they must innovate consistently to remain competitive, but on the other hand innovation is risky and expensive. Many organizations are forming business alliances to quicken the pace of and reduce risks associated with innovation. Yet by some estimates, 70% of these alliances fail. Many of the prescriptions for successful alliance management clash with recommendations for effective innovation management. The authors develop testable hypotheses by integrating the new products and alliance literature. A construct-cooperative competency-derived from related concepts of mutual adjustment, absorptive capacity, and relational capability is posited as the key factor affecting new product development success, regardless of whether it is an intra- or interfirm endeavor. The authors test the model with data from a sample survey in the semiconductor manufacturing context and replicate it in the health care sector. The antecedents of cooperative competency-formalized and clannish administration, mutual dependence, and institutional support-are revealed empirically and substantiated. The authors identify the importance and means of developing interfirm cooperation.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'COOPERATION', 'INDUSTRIAL', 'INNOVATION', 'MODEL', 'POWER', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERSPECTIVES']","['antecedents', 'cooperation', 'innovation', 'model']","['absorptive capacity', 'new product development success', 'mutual dependence', 'support', 'cooperation']",0.2,0.25
"We present and test a self-consistency theory framework for gossip: that perceived negative workplace gossip influences our self-perceptions and, in turn, this influences our behaviors. Using supervisor-subordinate dyadic time-lagged data (n = 403), we demonstrated that perceived negative workplace gossip adversely influenced target employees' organization-based self-esteem, which, in turn, influenced their citizenship behavior directed at the organization and at its members. Moreover, by integrating victimization theory into our framework, we further demonstrated that negative affectivity, an individual's dispositional tendency, not only moderated the self-consistency process but also predicted perceived negative workplace gossip. Our study therefore shifts attention to the target of negative workplace gossip and in doing so offers a promising new direction for future research. Implications to theory and practice are discussed.","['self-consistency theory', 'perceived negative workplace gossip', 'organizational citizenship behavior', 'organization-based self-esteem', 'negative affectivity', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'ABUSIVE SUPERVISION', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'WORK BEHAVIOR', 'ESTEEM', 'INCIVILITY', 'MODEL', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'AFFECTIVITY']","['self consistency theory', 'perceived negative workplace gossip', 'organization based self esteem', 'negative affectivity', 'esteem', 'affectivity']","['organization based self esteem', 'victimization']",0.5,0.16666666666666666
This manuscript provides the Nobel laureate's reflections on transaction cost economics. The overview section frames governance as the overarching concept and transaction cost economics as the means by which to breathe operational content into governance and organization. The vertical integration section identifies efficiency factors associated with determining when a firm produces a good or service to its own needs rather than outsource. A discussion of the rudiments of transaction cost analysis is subsequently provided. Puzzles and challenges that require pushing the logic of efficient governance to completion are examined and followed by concluding remarks.

"Research summary Analytic models are a powerful approach for developing theory, yet are often poorly understood in the strategy and organizations community. Our goal is to enhance the influence of the method by clarifying for consumers of modeling research how to understand and appreciate analytic modeling and use modeling results to enhance their own research. Our primary contribution is a guide for reading analytic models. Using comparisons with other methods and exemplar analytic models, we explore key features as well as counterintuitive aspects and common misconceptions. We also add by illuminating strengths and weaknesses of analytic modeling relative to other theory-building methods. Finally, we identify under-exploited opportunities for pairing analytic models with complementary methods. Overall, our aim is enhancing the influence of analytic modeling by better-informing consumers. Managerial summary In this paper, we explore the use of analytic (mathematical) models for developing strategy and organizations theory. Analytic modeling is common in related fields like economics but is often poorly understood among the broader of strategy and organizations community. Whereas existing resources on analytic modeling are geared towards modelers, our aim is to enhance understanding and appreciation of the method among potential consumers of modeling research. We offer three specific contributions in this regard. The first is a guide for reading analytic models, including key features, counterintuitive aspects, and common misconceptions. Second, we clarify the strengths and weaknesses of analytic modeling relative to other theory-building methods.

"We examine the impact of interorganizational imitation on new venture international entry and subsequent performance. Using a sample of 150 U.S.-based publicly held new ventures, we find that new venture international entry is in part an imitative response to the internationalization of other firms in the venture's home country industry and/or subsets of firms with certain traits or outcomes. We also find that interorganizational imitation moderates the relationship between new venture international entry and profitability, but not the relationship between new venture international entry and sales growth. These findings contribute to the growing body of literature on new venture internationalization.","['nan', 'INDUSTRY STRUCTURE', 'MIMETIC ISOMORPHISM', 'GLOBAL STRATEGY', 'MARKET ENTRY', 'FIRMS', 'MODE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'JAPANESE']","['firms', 'mode']",[],0,0.0
"This study tested links between vertical integration, cost structure, and performance at the line-of-business level of analysis. Major findings were (1) Vertical integration results in economies even after industry effects and economies of scope and scale are controlled. Vertically integrated lines of business economized on general and administrative, other selling, advertising, and R&D expenditures but had higher production costs and thus only marginally better profitability than nonintegrated lines of business in the same industry. (2) The higher production costs were linked to backward vertical integration, suggesting insulation from market pressures and lack of incentive to manufacture the lowest cost inputs. Forward vertical integration was associated with lower transaction-related costs. Thus, evidence of both efficiency effects and bureaucratic costs emerged, with the benefits of vertical integration slightly outweighing its costs.","['nan', 'DIVESTMENT DECISION-MAKING', 'DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY', 'CORPORATE-STRATEGY', 'PROFITABILITY', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'INDUSTRY', 'DETERMINANTS', 'COMPETITION', 'CHOICE', 'FIRM']","['profitability', 'industry']",[],0,0.0

"Although mistakes may have considerable potential for learning, previous research has emphasized that organizational members are often defensive when their mistakes are pointed out and will even continue with their present course of action despite growing costs. Recent research has shown that team-level variables, such as psychological safety and shared mental model, can help overcome barriers to learning from mistakes. Structural equation analyses on teams working in a sample of organizations in Shanghai, China, suggested that teams were able to learn from their mistakes to the extent that they took a problem solving orientation. This orientation in turn was based on developing cooperative but not competitive goals within the team. Although competitive and independent goals induce blaming, blaming itself was not significantly related to learning. Blaming, especially when conducted openly, may hold individual team members accountable as well as provoke defensiveness. Findings empirically link the theory of cooperation and competition with the organizational learning literature. Results suggest that cooperative goals and problem solving promote learning from mistakes.","['nan', 'SALES PERFORMANCE', 'INTERDEPENDENCE', 'SAFETY', 'CONTROVERSY', 'CONFLICT', 'BEHAVIOR', 'WORK', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'INFORMATION', 'PERCEPTION']","['safety', 'work']","['problem', 'cooperation', 'competition']",0.0,0.0

"Retailers can benefit from an increased understanding of how human territoriality affects their relationships with customers. In the context of closing time, we show that issuance of boundary markers, or closing time cues, before the closing time boundary can result in perceptions of territory intrusion and territorial responses from customers. In study 1, we identify six types of cues used by employees to signal to customers the closing time boundary is approaching: productive, personal, audio visual, withdrawal, hostility, and blocking cues. Three additional studies show these cues affect customers' perceptions of intrusion pressure and their subsequent territorial responses, including: retaliation, abandonment and accession (studies 2-4) and negative word of mouth and temporary abandonment (study 4). Additionally, identification with the store can heighten or dampen the effects of customers' perceptions of encroachment on their territorial responses (studies 3 and 4), depending on the retail context.

"Entrepreneurship researchers have documented that early stage startups rely on signals to demonstrate the transitions in their identities that they must make when they cross organizational life cycle thresholds. However, early stage startups in emerging industry contexts tend to have few good signals upon which to rely. Public agencies can play a valuable role in this process, but prior research has not sufficiently examined how startups effectively leverage this support. In this paper, therefore, we develop a framework to investigate the role that signals can play for early stage startups when they win prestigious government research grants. We test this framework in the setting of the emerging U.S. clean energy sector and find that in comparison to a matched sample of clean energy startups that have not won prestigious research grants, startups with these grants were 12% more likely to acquire subsequent venture capital (VC) funding. Another significant result is that the value of this signaling is greater for startups that have fewer patents. The important contribution of this finding is that it shows that signaling has the potential to redistribute benefits rather than just provide an additional accrual of advantages to the already high status actors. Together these results highlight the advantages for startups in emerging industries of pursuing signaling strategies with public agencies when they attempt to make important transitions through the stages of their organizational life cycles.& para;& para;Executive summary: Early stage startups seeking to acquire resources struggle to demonstrate the legitimacy they need to transition from conceptualization to commercialization. They must efficiently cross thresholds over the organizational life cycle to assure their survival and growth. Earlier work in entrepreneurship has demonstrated that the strategies startups use to cross these thresholds involve costly efforts to signal the quality of their ventures. In this paper, we study the value that signals have for startups in an emerging technology industry by examining the impact of government research grants on the recipients' ability to attract subsequent venture capital (VC) funding. Governments around the world are establishing larger pools of funds to catalyze innovative efforts and support early stage startups. This is especially the case in the area of clean technology where the proceeds of carbon taxes or cap-and-trade schemes are being directed towards promising technologies that lower greenhouse gas emissions. We show that the VC community picks up on the signals that underlie these types of government grants and startups can use these as proof points to demonstrate their potential to transition across life cycle stages. In comparison to a sample of U.S. based clean energy startups that have not won prestigious research grants, those startups that have been awarded these grants from federal agencies were 12% more likely to acquire subsequent venture capital (VC) funding. Interestingly, the effect is only present for the six months following receipt of a government grant and not for later windows. This suggests startups are likely to use these grants expeditiously in their advancing their relationships with VCs and that the cachet that comes from these awards may decay over time.& para;& para; Significantly, these proof points appear to compensate for a weakness that startups otherwise may have. That is, we find that startups with fewer or even no patents are likely to benefit from additional VC funding in comparison to startups with more patents. The signal sent by the grant then has the important effect of redistributing the benefits of VC funding rather than to simply advantage already well-endowed actors with many patented technologies. The role that the government can play in tipping the balance in the direction of less well-endowed startup ventures is an intriguing finding that deserves follow up for it points to an alternative strategic route that startups can take to move through the organizational life cycle.& para;& para;Our study makes several contributions. First, we identify a strategy that early stage startups adopt as they struggle to transit their identity from the conception to commercialization stages. We show how signals that startups establish through government research grants can distinguish them from non-grant recipient startups in a way that allows them to overcome information asymmetries and catalyze their efforts to establish ties with VCs. We further argue that for an early stage startup these grants have value beyond the monetary award if they can be used as an identity transforming event to avoid languishing in the well documented valley of death. Second, our focus on an emerging technology sector context shines light on how identity transitions differ based upon gradations in industry development. In this type of industry, the threshold external resource providers confront is more opaque and therefore it is greater than it is in mature industries, leading to wider identity transition gaps. Third, the dynamic aspect of the signaling strategy that we study about the early stage startups contributes to our understanding of when such firms extract value from signals. Finally, our findings offer interesting implications for policymakers responsible for designing research grant programs. We demonstrate that government grants have positive impacts on startups obtaining VC financing. Given the signaling value of grants, policymakers may consider involving VCs in the design of these programs.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'PROPENSITY SCORE', 'INNOVATION', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL', 'IMPACT', 'MARKET', 'FIRMS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LEGITIMACY', 'MANAGEMENT']","['impact', 'firms', 'legitimacy']",['clean energy'],0.0,0.0

Second, a subsidiary also has a voice of its own that it can use to attract attention. Third, the relationship between a subsidiary's voice and headquarters attention is moderated by two specific aspects of the subsidiary's historical situation: geographic distance and downstream competence.","['nan', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'EVOLUTION', 'STRATEGY', 'SILENCE', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'COMMITMENT', 'ENTERPRISE', 'ADVANTAGES', 'LOCATION']",['enterprise'],"['subsidiaries', 'headquarters']",0.0,0.0
"This paper attempts to understand the role of two highly relevant founder family characteristics, harmony among family members and the degree of democratization in decision-making, in the institutionalization and adaptive capability development processes of family firms in Turkey as an exemplar of an emerging market. The paper examines how institutionalization and adaptability jointly drive firm-level differences in quantitative (i.e., sales growth, market share, and return on investment) and qualitative performance (i.e., quality of goods/services, new product development, employee satisfaction) components. Data were collected from 436 respondents in 132 family firms through structured questionnaires administered to at least three respondents from each firm. Findings indicated that among the institutionalization dimensions, transparency had the strongest effect on both quantitative and qualitative firm performance, whereas adaptability influenced qualitative performance only. Harmony in family relations increased efforts for institutionalization, whereas democracy in decision-making enhanced adaptability. Implications of these findings are discussed and several future research directions are suggested. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

"We develop a simple test to assess whether horizontal spillover effects from multinational to domestic firms are endogenous to the market structure generated by the incremental entry of the same multinationals. In particular, we analyze the performance of a panel of 10,650 firms operating in Romania in the period 1995-2001. Controlling for the simultaneity bias in productivity estimates through semi-parametric techniques, we find that changes in domestic firms' total factor productivity are positively related to the first foreign investment in a specific industry and region, but get significantly weaker and become negative as the number of multinationals that enter in the considered industry/region crosses a specific threshold. These changing marginal effects can explain the lack of horizontal spillovers arising in traditional model designs. We also find these effects to vary between manufacturing and services, suggesting as a possible explanation a strategic change in technology transfer decisions by multinational firms as the market structure evolves.

"Knowledge has become one of the most important sources of competitive advantage for firms in many industries, particularly those in which firms provide knowledge services to their clients. Many knowledge intensive firms have spent enormous amounts of time and money trying to find ways to better manage their knowledge resources. Effective leveraging of knowledge resources through the transfer and reuse of existing knowledge is an important aspect of most knowledge management systems. In this study we argue that the effectiveness of intrafirm knowledge transfer based on the reuse of existing knowledge depends on two key factors: (1) the willingness of individuals to contribute their knowledge to the system; and (2) the rate at which individuals access and reuse knowledge within the system. Here we use social exchange theory to develop a model of the factors that will impact the frequency with which individuals contribute their knowledge to the system. Additionally, we use expectancy theory to develop a model of the factors that lead to knowledge reuse. Results of hypothesis tests using data collected from a multinational services firm support our multi-theoretical model, and suggest ways in which the model might be refined. We discuss the implications of these findings for further theory building and for managers engaged in the development and improvement of knowledge management systems.","['nan', 'LEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'SOCIAL-EXCHANGE', 'SELF-EFFICACY', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'USER ACCEPTANCE', 'DYNAMIC THEORY', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'SUPPORT']","['social exchange', 'competitive advantage', 'support']",['management'],0.0,0.0
"Drawing on theories of emotional contagion and goal setting, we propose two mechanisms as to how employees' perceptions of entrepreneurial passion influence their commitment to entrepreneurial ventures. Testing these mechanisms with data from a survey of 124 employees, we find that employees' perceptions of their supervisors' passion for inventing, founding, and developing differentially impact commitment. While perceptions of entrepreneurs' passion for inventing and developing enhance commitment, passion for founding reduces it. Employees' experiences of positive affect at work and their goal clarity mediate these effects. Our results have implications for the literature on entrepreneurial passion and leadership in entrepreneurial firms.","['nan', 'ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT', 'CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP', 'EMOTIONAL CONTAGION', 'ROLE AMBIGUITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'IDENTITY', 'WORK', 'GOAL', 'CONSEQUENCES']","['emotional contagion', 'work', 'goal']",[],0,0.0
"Service employees' emotional and behavioral responses to angry customer complaints were examined to help firms improve their service recovery performance. Role-played complaints were conducted in a field experiment set in fast-food restaurants. Actors played customers who complained in an angry fashion to service employees. Employees' immediate emotional (i.e., expressed anger) and delayed behavioral responses (i.e., restitution offered) were observed. A follow-up scenario-based experimental study was used to retest the hypotheses and add controls to rule out potential rival explanations. In both studies, level of customer status (low vs. high; true experimental design) and strength of a restaurant's service climate (weak vs. strong; quasi-experimental design) were manipulated. The findings confirm that employees in a weak service climate expressed more anger and were less likely to offer restitution to low- compared to high-status customers. In contrast, in a strong service climate, employee responses were less dependent on customer status and converged at a low level of anger and high probability of restitution offered. Furthermore, the consistent immediate affective and delayed behavioral responses suggest that a strong service climate is internalized by frontline employees. This study contributes to service theory by establishing a customer status main effect on both affective and conative employee responses and by confirming service climate as a boundary condition for the customer status main effect. A key implication for managers is that establishing a strong service climate is important for achieving effective service recovery in increasingly diverse societies.","['customer anger', 'angry complaints', 'restitution', 'service recovery', 'service employees', 'customer status', 'service climate', 'EMOTIONAL CONTAGION', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'SEX-DIFFERENCES', 'DISPLAY RULES', 'SATISFACTION', 'EXPRESSION', 'IMPACT', 'ANGER', 'WORK', 'PERCEPTIONS']","['restitution', 'service recovery', 'service employees', 'customer status', 'service climate', 'anger']","['behavioral responses', 'customer complaints', 'service recovery', 'restitution', 'customer status']",0.6,0.5
"Drawing on the customer participation (CP) literature, this research proposes that CP variation is the degree to which employees perceive variability across customers with regard to customers sharing information, time, and effort and making suggestions to enhance the service delivery process and outcome. Drawing on the job demands-resources model, this research explicates the mediating process by which CP variation affects customer service performance and its boundary conditions. Study 1 uses data from a field study in the banking industry to show that CP variation negatively influences customer service performance through greater customer-related burnout. The authors show that this mediation process is moderated by contingencies that mitigate or exacerbate the indirect relationship. Study 2 further validates the CP variation construct by testing for discriminant validity against similar and related constructs, such as CP quality, in more diverse service industries (insurance, legal consulting, travel and tourism, health care, and physical fitness). Finally, an examination of the moderating role of CP quality provides a more nuanced picture of the intricacies between CP variation and CP quality. This article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications for CP variation research.","['customer participation', 'customer participation variation', 'customer participation quality', 'burnout', 'customer service', 'LEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'PATIENT PARTICIPATION', 'RESOURCES', 'EMPLOYEES', 'CLIMATE', 'MULTILEVEL', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'BURNOUT', 'SELF', 'COPRODUCTION']","['customer participation', 'burnout', 'customer service', 'resources', 'employees', 'burnout']","['customer participation', 'job demands resources', 'customer service performance', 'burnout', 'indirect', 'research']",0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333
"We examine how, and to what extent, migrants in a host country attract foreign direct investment (FDI) from firms based in their country of origin (CO). Introducing the notion of institutional affinity, we argue that increased institutional affinity and increased connectedness of institutional environments of migrants' CO and country of residence, make a location attractive to CO firms.

"Steady customer losses create pressure for firms to acquire new accounts, a task that is both costly and risky. Lacking knowledge about their prospects, firms often use a large array of predictors obtained from list vendors, which in turn rapidly creates massive high-dimensional data problems. Selecting the appropriate variables and their functional relationships with acquisition probabilities is therefore a substantial challenge. This study proposes a Bayesian variable selection approach to optimally select targets for new customer acquisition. Data from an insurance company reveal that this approach outperforms nonselection methods and selection methods based on expert judgment as well as benchmarks based on principal component analysis and bootstrap aggregation of classification trees. Notably, the optimal results show that the Bayesian approach selects panel-based metrics as predictors, detects several nonlinear relationships, selects very large numbers of addresses, and generates profits. In a series of post hoc analyses, the authors consider prospects' response behaviors and cross-selling potential and systematically vary the number of predictors and the estimated profit per response. The results reveal that more predictors and higher response rates do not necessarily lead to higher profits.","['new customer acquisition', 'address selection', 'variable selection', 'big data', 'campaign optimization', 'RETENTION', 'MODELS', 'CHURN']","['new customer acquisition', 'variable selection']","['predictors', 'customer acquisition', 'principal component analysis', 'metrics', 'cross']",0.0,0.0

"Innovation scholars have long touted the value of cross-functional teams, and though firms have embraced a cross-functional design in their new product development (NPD) teams, these teams continue to face challenges. Stability in an NPD team may offer important advantages for decision making; however, its effectiveness as a structural coordination mechanism remains largely unexplored. Therefore, to offer insight into the value of NPD team stability, the authors develop a process-based model that examines the extent to which stability influences certain decision-making processes, which in turn influence new product advantage. They examine these relationships with a sample of cross-functional NPD project teams from 208 high-technology firms. The results reveal that the degree of stability in an NPD project team has a curvilinear relationship to team-level debate and decision-making comprehensiveness. In turn, whereas debate is positively related to decision comprehensiveness, decision comprehensiveness is positively related to new product advantage only at high levels. These curvilinear patterns shed light on anecdotal evidence that currently attributes success to both stable and unstable project teams.","['new product development', 'teams', 'stability', 'decision making', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'COGNITIVE DIVERSITY', 'CENTRIPETAL FORCES', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'COMPREHENSIVENESS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'COMMUNICATION', 'CONSEQUENCES']","['new product development', 'teams', 'stability', 'decision making', 'comprehensiveness']",['product advantage'],0.0,0.0
"This study investigates how the inevitable disclosure doctrine, a form of trade secret legal protection, affects venture capital (VC) investment. Using a data set of VC deals realized in the United States from 1980 to 2012, we find that a rule in favor of inevitable disclosure increases the amount of VC investment. We address mechanisms that can explain these findings by assessing how the inevitable disclosure doctrine (a) displays a different impact on VC investments according to the characteristics of the state and the industry where the start-ups operate and (b) affects the performance of VC-backed firms. We also discuss managerial and policy implications of our findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Strategies of internationalization have long been the focus of international business and global strategy research. While the major theories - process theory and new venture theory - have substantially contributed to our understanding of internationalization processes, they have not yet fully explained differences in firms' growth and survival rates. Adopting a dynamic capability perspective, we argue that there are two opposing classes of explorative and exploitative capabilities differentially linked to output variables.

"This article develops and tests a model of how organizational structure influences organizational performance. Organizational structure, conceptualized as the decision-making structure among a group of individuals, is shown to affect the number of initiatives pursued by organizations and the omission and commission errors (Type I and II errors, respectively) made by organizations. The empirical setting is more than 150,000 stock-picking decisions made by 609 mutual funds. Mutual funds offer an ideal and rare setting to test the theory, since there are detailed records on the projects they face, the decisions they make, and the outcomes of these decisions. The study's independent variable, organizational structure, is coded based on fund management descriptions made by Morningstar, and estimates of the omission and commission errors are computed by a novel technique that uses bootstrapping to create measures that are comparable across funds. The findings suggest that organizational structure has relevant and predictable effects on a wide range of organizations. In particular, the article shows empirically that increasing the consensus threshold required by a committee in charge of selecting projects leads to more omission errors, fewer commission errors, and fewer approved projects. Applications include designing organizations that achieve a given mix of exploration and exploitation, as well as predicting the consequences of centralization and decentralization. This work constitutes the first large-sample empirical test of the model by Sah and Stiglitz (1986).

"Sustainability has become a pervasive issue for the luxury sector, gaining traction with brand managers, scholars, policy-makers, the media, and academia. The purpose of this paper is to examine the state of sustainable luxury research in marketing and consumer behaviour by critically reviewing and synthesizing the growing but fragmented body of scholarly work on sustainable-luxury marketing. The paper critically assesses where, how and by whom research on sustainable luxury is being conducted, and it identifies gaps for future investigation. The paper reviews research published between 2007 and 2018 within major peer-reviewed English-language scholarly publications in business, marketing, ethics, fashion, food and tourism journals. The research is identified using the keywords sustainable luxury, green luxury, eco-luxury and organic luxury. Three core themes emerge from this review: (1) consumer concerns and practices; (2) organizational concerns and practices; and (3) international and cross-cultural issues. The review confirms that research on sustainable luxury is significantly underdeveloped. This paper provides the first critical and comprehensive assessment and categorization of the emergent literature streams on sustainable luxury. The authors argue for a broader, deeper and more critical research agenda on the relationship between sustainability and luxury. Potential avenues for future research on sustainable luxury are proposed, with calls for theoretical and cross-cultural reflections that tackle broader systemic and institutional issues within the field.","['nan', 'CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'SUPPLY-CHAIN MANAGEMENT', 'TOURISM DEVELOPMENT', 'CONSUMERS CARE', 'CONSUMPTION', 'FASHION', 'GREEN', 'BEHAVIOR', 'IMPACT', 'CSR']","['fashion', 'green']","['sustainability', 'consumer concerns']",0.0,0.0
"Since 1982, the government of Korea has actively promoted vertical cooperative R&D programs between government-sponsored research institutes (GRIs) and private firms. A number of firms participated in the programs because cooperative R&D could lower the risk and could contribute to rapid commercialization of many technologies. In this article, Chulwon Lee, Zong-Tae Bae, and Jinjoo Lee examine the effectiveness of participant firms' strategies for commercial utilization of cooperative R&D results,from the viewpoint of technology sourcing at the project level. The data have been obtained from 162 cases of vertical cooperative R&D projects from a diverse group of industries in Korea. Three different commercialization strategies are empirically derived through cluster analysis of the relative usage rates of cooperative R&D and of other supplementary technology acquisition methods. They find that the effectiveness of these strategy clusters varies significantly according to the types of innovation, that is, project-business relatedness. If the project belongs to an existing business area, in-house development augmented cooperative R&D strategy is the most effective. On the other hand, licensing-in supplemented cooperative R&D strategy is the most successful, if the project belongs to a new business area. Findings suggest that firms participating in cooperative R&D projects should try to utilize other supplementary technology acquisition methods in order to achieve commercial utilization of cooperative R&D results.","['nan', 'EXTERNAL TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'GOVERNMENT', 'CORPORATE', 'POLICY']",['government'],"['strategy clusters', 'innovation']",0.0,0.0
"Firms spend substantial resources responding to customer complaints, and the marketing profession has a long history of supporting that enterprise to promote customer loyalty. The authors question whether this response is always warranted or whether its effectiveness instead depends on economic, industry, customer-firm, product/service, and customer segment factors that may alter the firm's incentives to compete on complaint management. To consider this question, they integrate economic and marketing theories and investigate factors that influence the complaint recovery-customer loyalty relationship via a sample of 35,597 complaining customers spanning a ten-year period across economic sectors, industries, and firms. Overall, the authors find that the recovery-loyalty relationship is stronger in faster-growing economies, for industries with more competition, for luxury products, and for customers with higher satisfaction and higher expectations of customization. Conversely, the recovery-loyalty relationship is weaker when customers' expectations of product/service reliability are higher, for manufactured goods, and for men compared with women. The authors discuss implications of these results for managers, policy makers, and researchers for more effective management of customer complaints.","['customer complaint behavior', 'complaint recovery', 'customer loyalty', 'complaint management incentives', 'exit-voice-loyalty theory', 'customer satisfaction', 'SERVICE RECOVERY PARADOX', 'INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY', 'POLITICAL-IDEOLOGY', 'SATISFACTION', 'MODEL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FAILURES', 'QUALITY', 'IMPACT', 'RESPONSES']","['complaint recovery', 'customer loyalty', 'satisfaction']","['firms', 'complaints', 'customer loyalty']",0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333

"We propose that market characteristics interact with retailer characteristics to determine online prices. The retailer characteristics examined include-service quality of a retailer, channels of transaction provided by a retailer and the size of a retailer. The market characteristics capture the level and nature of competition, and the price level of a product. We utilize a Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) framework for capturing and testing the proposed interactions. The better fit between the model and the online market structure is reflected by a twenty-five percent increase in explainable price dispersion over results from comparable studies. Our study demonstrates that while retailer characteristics do impact online prices, this influence is significantly enhanced or diminished by the accompanying market characteristics.

"Today's business customers expect sellers not only to respond effectively to their expressed needs but also to understand their business sufficiently well to proactively address their latent and future needs. Yet, research shows that many firms underestimate, misunderstand, or overlook these customer expectations. To draw clarity to this discrepancy, this study explores the notion of proactive customer orientation and examines the degree to which this capability offers an opportunity for competitive advantage. While research in recent years has explored the role of proactive customer orientation in new product performance, empirical investigation in this stream of market orientation literature is significantly underdeveloped. We assess the impact of the proactive customer orientation construct on value creation by taking a novel approach that examines the proactive customer orientation -> value -> satisfaction -> loyalty chain using data from 800 business customers in India, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We find that, relative to other firm capabilities, proactive customer orientation is the most consistent driver of customer value across our multinational data set. Results also show robust effects for the interaction of proactive and responsive customer orientation to create superior value. Several moderating conditions further frame the impact of this capability: intense levels of customer value change, a global relationship scope, and a transnational relationship structure. Overall, findings significantly advance the understanding of the proactive dimension within market orientation and provide marketers with insights for voice of the customer processes.","['Proactive customer orientation', 'Market orientation', 'Customer value', 'Buyer-seller relationships', 'DESIRED VALUE CHANGE', 'ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT', 'BUSINESS MARKETS', 'SATISFACTION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ILLUSTRATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'CAPABILITIES', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'ADAPTATION']","['proactive customer orientation', 'market orientation', 'customer value', 'satisfaction', 'performance', 'capabilities']","['customer orientation', 'product performance', 'value satisfaction loyalty']",0.0,0.0

"Drawing on interviews with 77 high-performing eBay business sellers in France and Belgium, this article investigates the power asymmetries generated by customers' evaluations in online work settings. Sellers revealed a high degree of sensitivity to negative reviews, which, while infrequent, triggered feelings of anxiety and vulnerability. Their accounts exposed power asymmetries at two levels: the transactional level between sellers and customers and the governance level between sellers and eBay. Our findings highlight three main mechanisms underlying power asymmetries in this context. First, online customer evaluations have created a new form of employee monitoring in which power is exercised through the construction of visibility gaps between buyers and sellers and through an implicit coalition between buyers and the platform owner, who join together in the evaluation procedures. Second, by mediating and objectifying relations, algorithms reproduce power asymmetries among the different categories of actors, thereby constraining human agency. Third, online customer evaluations prompt sellers to exploit their practical knowledge of the algorithm to increase their agency. Through the lived experience of working for an algorithm, our findings contribute new understandings of power and agency in online work settings.","['power asymmetries', 'algorithms', 'online evaluations', 'sociomateriality', 'agency', 'practice', 'PERFORMANCE-APPRAISAL', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'COMMUNITIES', 'INFORMATION', 'MATERIALITY', 'BUREAUCRACY', 'REACTIVITY', 'EMERGENCE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'COERCION']","['power asymmetries', 'algorithms', 'agency', 'knowledge']","['power', 'online work', 'monitoring', 'agency', 'work settings']",0.2,0.25
"Regulatory oversight that affects the firm's product-market environment continues to increase. Political management capital (PMC) describes firm expenditure committed to address the political and regulatory context. Neoinstitutional theory casts PMC as an institutionally expected normative response investors use when evaluating firm performance. Although limited evidence has suggested that firms benefit from PMC, the authors demonstrate its effects across financial outcomes including firm value, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Likewise, they examine how PMC interacts with a firm's product market through research-and-development (R&D) capital and advertising capital. Regression analysis of an unbalanced data set of 212 firms in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry, tracked from 2003 to 2014, reveals that while PMC improves investor expectations through firm value and systematic risk, it increases idiosyncratic risk. The authors find that PMC plays both substitutive and complementary roles with R&D such that increasing levels of both PMC and R&D weakens main effects. Political management capital has limited, but substitutive, effects with advertising likely because there is less regulatory oversight on advertising versus R&D in this industry. The authors explore these asymmetric effects, provide implications for neoinstitutional theory, and offer managerial insights.","['political management strategy', 'neoinstitutional theory', 'research and development', 'advertising', 'pharmaceutical industry', 'MANAGERIAL TIES', 'STOCK-MARKET', 'IDIOSYNCRATIC RISK', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'IMPACT', 'CAPABILITIES', 'CONNECTIONS', 'SUBSTITUTES', 'ENVIRONMENT']","['neoinstitutional theory', 'research and development', 'advertising', 'idiosyncratic risk', 'firm performance', 'environment']","['regulatory oversight', 'political management capital', 'neoinstitutional', 'performance', 'firm value systematic risk', 'idiosyncratic', 'research and development', 'advertising capital regression']",0.125,0.16666666666666666
"Small firms are thought to encounter various difficulties implementing strategic alliances. Due to these problems, they may be less able to reap the benefits of alliance adaptation, and the changes that do occur in alliances may not coincide with a small firm's interests. The evidence we present on contractual renegotiations in alliances suggests that small firms are no more or less likely to adjust their alliances' contracts in general. However, small firms tend to bear inefficiencies of two kinds in their collaborations. First, they are less likely to adapt alliances in the presence of governance misalignments. Second, our sampled small firms were more prone to make transaction-specific investments, which can stimulate ex post hold-up in the form of contractual renegotiations.","['nan', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'TRANSACTION COST', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'BARGAINING POWER', 'GOVERNANCE', 'SIZE', 'CHOICE', 'DETERMINANTS', 'COOPERATION', 'EVOLUTION']","['strategic alliances', 'governance']","['firms', 'alliances']",0.0,0.0
"Many new marketing strategies falter in the execution phase where managers fail to make frontline employees fully committed to implementing the new initiatives. While formal managers can apply transformational and transactional leadership behaviors to increase salespeople's strategy commitment, peers can also exert a great deal of informal influence on salespeople. Building on recent social network perspectives of leadership, this paper investigates the interplay between the sales manager's leadership styles and peer effects during the implementation of a new strategy in a large sales organization. The authors find that salespeople with high network centrality but low strategy commitment not only lower their peers' commitment but also hurt the effectiveness of a transformational manager. Specially, the influence of a central salesperson becomes stronger when the sales group has lower external connectivity. However, sales managers' transactional leadership can decrease the non-committed central salesperson's influence over peers.","['Strategy implementation in sales', 'Strategy role commitment', 'Informal networks in sales force', 'Transformational and transactional leadership', 'Social network analysis', 'MARKETING-STRATEGY', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SALESPEOPLE', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'CUSTOMER', 'IMPACT', 'TEAMS', 'ORGANIZATIONS']","['transformational and transactional leadership', 'transactional leadership', 'salespeople']","['transactional leadership', 'salespeople', 'network centrality', 'transactional leadership']",0.5,0.6666666666666666

"Several theoretical and empirical developments in the literature on foreign entry mode and performance, and on (international) strategy more generally, were influenced or prefigured by Brouthers' (2002) JIBS Decade Award winning paper. Regarding theory, Brouthers is an archetype of the integration of transaction cost and institutional perspectives. I argue that it is also relevant to the growing literature that aims at synthesizing these and other perspectives. Methodologically, Brouthers (2002) contributed several uniquely direct and rich measures. Furthermore, it not only displayed awareness of endogeneity (specifically self-selection) issues, but also was among the pioneers in the comparative analysis of governance choices for a given firm or transaction. I elaborate on the promising if challenging use of such what if imputation to identify the impact of more or less well-aligned choices. Overall, I argue that such methodological advances cannot be decoupled from the conceptual advances that enable them, and which they reinforce.

"Buzz during the period leading up to commercial release is commonly cited as a critical success factor for new products. But what exactly is buzz? Based on an extensive literature review and findings from a theories-in-use study (consumer depth interviews and focus groups), the authors argue that pre-release consumer buzz (PRCB) is not just a catchword or a synonym for word of mouth but is a distinct construct for which a precise, shared conceptual understanding is notably absent. The authors define PRCB as the aggregation of observable expressions of anticipation by consumers for a forthcoming new product; they conceptualize the construct as being manifested in three distinct types of behaviors (communication, search, and participation in experiential activities) along two dimensions (amount and pervasiveness). PRCB is unique because prior to, versus after, a product's release, (1) differing information is available, (2) differing mental processes occur, and (3) consumers' behaviors have differing effects on other consumers, affecting diffusion differently.

"Studies argue that generalist CEOs are more valued by the market for executive labor and receive higher initial compensation. Challenging this prevailing assumption, we acknowledge the drawbacks of extensive career mobility and predict an inverted U-shape relationship between CEO generalist career experience and CEO initial compensation. Integrating the generalism and specialization views of human capital, we postulate that at an initial level, the acquisition of experience breadth from different firms and industries enables CEOs to broaden their knowledge base, obtain a variety of skills, and thus increase their labor market value and initial compensation. After a threshold, however, the accumulation of extensive levels of career generalism through frequent job hopping across firm and industry contexts gradually causes a lack of experience depth and insufficient career specialization, thereby triggering lower CEO market value and initial pay. Data from 197 CEO appointments in large, publicly traded firms support our predictions. Our results also show that the observed inverted U-shape relationship varies with factors nested at different layers of context, highlighting the contingent nature of this area of research.","['CEO career experience', 'CEO compensation', 'human capital', 'curvilinearity', 'executive job demands', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'WORK EXPERIENCE', 'DARK SIDE', 'PAY', 'MANAGERIAL', 'LABOR', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'MARKET']","['human capital', 'pay', 'labor', 'market']","['compensation', 'career experience']",0.0,0.0
"This paper uses a comparative institutionalist approach combined with a power/interests perspective to examine the processes whereby diversity policy is 'internationalised' by US multinational companies. It argues that the process of policy transfer to UK subsidiaries is complicated by incomplete and contested 'institutionalisation' of diversity within the US itself, and by differing conceptions of diversity between the US and the UK. The ability of actors within the UK subsidiaries to mobilise and deploy specific power resources allows them to resist the full implementation of corporate diversity policy, leading to a range of compromise accommodations.

"Owner sacrifice was studied as a key variable for predicting small business growth dynamics. Using Conservation of Resources Theory, three different types of sacrifice were defined: personal, financial, and relational. Their relation to growth was studied on data collected through structured interviews in 852 small firms in thirteen cities in Turkey. Personal sacrifices in time and effort had a positive effect on continuous growth, both singularly and in interaction with firm's environment, size, and strategic planning.

"Referral reward programs have been shown in past research to stimulate referrals and also to contribute positively to customer lifetime value and firms' profitability. In this paper we examine whether, how, and under what conditions providing a reward for a referral affects receivers' responses to the referral. Based on a multiple motives inference framework, we propose that rewards adversely affect responses because they lead receiving consumers to infer ulterior motives for the referral. Using experiments and a survey, we find support for this hypothesis and show that this effect is stronger for unsolicited and weak tie referrals. We also demonstrate that rewarding both the referral provider and receiver or providing symbolic rewards can eliminate the negative effect of rewarded referrals. The paper makes conceptual contributions to the literature on referral reward programs, word-of-mouth, and motive inferences. The work has implications for managers considering ways to construct referral programs and design marketing activities to increase referrals.","['Word of Mouth', 'Referral', 'Reward Program', 'Motive Inference', 'Tie Strength', 'WORD-OF-MOUTH', 'PERSUASION KNOWLEDGE', 'TIE STRENGTH', 'MEDIATION', 'PROGRAMS', 'THOUGHTS', 'MODEL']","['word of mouth', 'referral', 'reward program', 'motive inference', 'word of mouth', 'programs']","['referral reward programs', 'lifetime', 'multiple motives inference framework', 'word of mouth']",0.25,0.16666666666666666

"Prior studies have argued entrepreneurial orientation ( EO) plays an important role in explaining firm performance. This study aims to assess how senior team attributes moderate the relationship between EO and firm performance. For this purpose, an attention-based perspective is adopted, focusing on attention scope as well as distributed and situated attention. By considering the role of senior team heterogeneity in broadening the attention scope of senior teams and the role of senior team shared vision in aligning distributed attention across organizational functions, this research investigates how senior teams may enhance the value-creating potential of EO. In addition, we assess situated attention by including the notion of environmental dynamism and examining whether the role of the senior team attributes is contingent upon environmental conditions. Using a time-lagged sample of 346 firms operating in various industries, we find that senior team heterogeneity helps firms to leverage their EO and improve their performance. Moreover, once environmental conditions are taken into account, results indicate that the absence of heterogeneity at senior team level may be particularly detrimental for firms operating in stable environments. The direct moderating effect of shared vision on the relationship between EO and performance is not substantiated. However, senior team shared vision has a positive impact for firms operating in dynamic environments, providing a premium for firms aiming to realize the inherent value of EO. Our research provides important implications for senior teams aiming to leverage their EO into increased firm performance. Evidence shows that while a heterogeneous team composition and senior team shared vision may provide several benefits, these advantages may fluctuate across environmental conditions.","['nan', 'STRATEGIC DECISION-PROCESSES', 'WORK GROUP DIVERSITY', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMISM', 'BUSINESS PERFORMANCE', 'LINKING', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'CONFLICT']",['environmental dynamism'],"['entrepreneurial orientation', 'firm performance', 'environmental dynamism']",0.3333333333333333,1.0
"In the current study, expansion of foreign investment in transition economies such as China is analyzed as an organizational selection process in a community ecology setting. Insights from organizational ecology are used to explain how institutional forces constrain ecological processes, together driving the evolution of the population size of foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs), privately held domestic firms, and state-owned domestic organizations. We argue that the variation in the relative forces of ecological processes and institutional constraints across FIEs and their domestic rivals accounts for the expansion of FIEs in China. On the one hand, in many transition economies, institutional constraints are imposed on foreign enterprises by regulation that limits FDI opportunities. On the other hand, after entry, foreign enterprises can benefit from their competitive advantages in their ecological struggle against domestic rivals. This logic produces different sets of hypotheses as to foreign enterprises' density and sales growth, in interaction with domestic organizations. Using a data set of the Chinese construction industry in 29 provinces over the 1993-2006 period, estimation of a partial adjustment growth model produces support for our theoretical claim.

"This study addresses a long-standing debate in the literature regarding the appropriateness and performance consequences of marketing strategy standardization vs. adaptation. Much of the relevant literature represents the headquarters' viewpoint and broadly assesses antecedents of standardization or adaptation across widely varying markets. Using strategic fit as the theoretical platform for analysis, the study investigates international marketing strategy for a specific product or line within subsidiaries of U.S., Japanese, and German multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in the U.K. The results indicate that degree of strategy standardization is significantly related to similarity between markets with respect to regulatory environments, technological intensity and velocity, customs and traditions, customer characteristics, a product's stage in its life cycle, and competitive intensity. On the critical question of performance consequences, the findings suggest that superior performance results from strategy standardization only to the extent that there is fit or coalignment between the MNC's environmental context and its international marketing strategy choice.

"Previous research has typically treated collection as a top-down process and focused on its later stages. However, collections may start by accident and are often triggered by incidental, bottom-up factors. The authors propose that a small number of possessions (i.e., a few more than one) represent an unjustified and, thus, unstable possession level that prompts a status change. They examine the collection tipping point at which obtaining items belonging to a series (e.g., a couple of collectible Coke cans) often gives rise to a decision to start a collection. Consumers then seek additional items to fulfill their emerging goal. In six lab studies and one field study, the authors investigate the tipping point at which a collection project begins and explore the psychological processes underlying that tipping point. In addition, they discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of this research.","['collections', 'tipping point', 'decision making', 'justification', 'marketing tactics', 'GRADIENT HYPOTHESIS', 'CHOICE', 'PSYCHOLOGY', 'DECISION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'FOOD', 'SET']","['collections', 'tipping point', 'decision']","['possessions', 'project']",0.0,0.0

"Research Summary: Regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny question of whether to mandate a governance practice or allow for organic adoption. While mandates afford rapid diffusion, we theorize that they also result in ceremonial adoptions. Leveraging a quasi-natural experiment, we compare adoption outcomes for a governance practice-lead director adoption-that was mandated by the NYSE but not the NASDAQ. We find that NYSE firms are more likely than NASDAQ firms to have installed a lead director as a symbolic management tactic, so their lead directors are less effectual. We also find that transient institutional investors are deceived by this symbolic management, but dedicated institutional investors are not. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and analysts often desire to see companies introduce strict governance measures, such as proxy access and independent boards. Consequently, regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny issue of whether and when to mandate such practices for all companies. What they might not realize is that mandates may not work as well as they seem. Although more companies adopt reform under a mandate, they do so merely as a symbolic gesture. We look at one governance reform-appointing a lead director-finding that companies who introduce this reform as a result of a mandate appoint someone that is relatively toothless. We also find, though, that savvy investors are not actually fooled by this tactic and will trade out of firms that attempt such symbolic management.","['boards of directors', 'corporate governance', 'governance reform', 'impression management', 'lead directors', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'CEO TURNOVER', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS', 'SYMBOLIC MANAGEMENT', 'SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM', 'BOARD COMPOSITION', 'FIRM-PERFORMANCE', 'FORMAL-STRUCTURE']","['governance reform', 'lead directors', 'institutional investors', 'symbolic management']","['governance', 'management', 'directors', 'institutional investors', 'reform']",0.2,0.25
"Organizational social capital (OSC), the goodwill and resources companies gain from their relationships with other companies, enables family firms to assemble the resources (especially knowledge) necessary for successful adaptation. Connecting with new ventures, the vanguard of radical change, is a priority for family firms seeking to achieve survival, profitability and growth. Yet, new ventures are often not well known and their networks are poorly structured, making access to them difficult. Using the relational perspectives on interorganizational relationships, this study proposes that family firms can employ their OSC to reach new ventures. Family firms can invest in these ventures, build profitable business relationships and alliances with them, as well as assist in governing their operations. Data from 779 companies show that family firms are in better positions to harvest their large OSC stocks to connect with new ventures. The results underscore the value of OSC as an important relational resource for family firms.","['nan', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'OPPORTUNITIES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'GOVERNANCE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'RESOURCES', 'ALLIANCES', 'CREATION', 'STRATEGY']","['resources', 'alliances']","['social capital', 'family firms']",0.0,0.0
"A great deal is known about how managers influence team empowerment, but very little is known about what organizations do to influence empowerment. Using teams drawn from 94 Chinese high-technology companies, the authors show that organizational decentralization enhances empowerment when decision making is delegated downward even when not directly delegated to teams. Prior research has presented both a positive and negative view of formalization, and this study found that the organizational level to which formalization is applied makes a difference. Formalization of organizational processes enhances team empowerment by reducing uncertainty within the firm, whereas formalization of jobs and roles moderates the effect of decentralization and reduces team empowerment by reducing teams' flexibility in taking advantage of decentralization. These results show the importance of organization structure as an antecedent of empowerment and highlight the contrasting effects of different types of formalization.","['team empowerment', 'decentralization', 'formalization', 'China', 'INTERRATER RELIABILITY', 'MEASUREMENT ERROR', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL', 'WORK', 'SATISFACTION', 'IMPACT', 'DIMENSIONS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MEDIATION']","['team empowerment', 'decentralization', 'formalization']",['team empowerment'],1.0,0.3333333333333333

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify when students choose their major and when students become interested in a career field, to devise a supply chain management (SCM) talent outreach strategy. Design/methodology/approach - A survey was administered to undergraduate students in SCM classes, and the responses were explored through multinomial logistic regression analyses. Findings - The paper revealed that interest in the career field is a major factor in choosing a college degree, among other factors. The timing of when a student chooses a major is influenced by interest in the field and whether or not the student lived abroad. The career field chosen is influenced by race, by whether or not the student lived abroad and by prior experience. Outreach strategies to attract new talent to supply chain-related fields should start prior to a student entering college. Research limitations/implications - Results are based on a survey research with a limited geographic coverage, and the research is limited to investigating student whose college major is other than SCM, leaving opportunities for further research where the college major is SCM. Originality/value - The authors provide original findings that improve outreach strategies to attract next generation supply chain talent.

"Research is lacking on the role of international entrepreneurship when the focus is on management's efforts in external organization and firm level dissemination of knowledge from partners after a foreign market entry. The theoretical framework fills this gap and analyses the relationship between entrepreneurial competence and two relational capabilities of partnership knowledge exchange and partnership management. It further investigates their influence on firms' performance at the initial and subsequent export expansion stages using a sample of 100 firms from ICT industry. The results indicate a positive relationship between entrepreneurial competence and the relational capabilities. However, relational capability of partnership knowledge exchange is only found to influence the initial export expansion stage. The overall theoretical model provides more support for the effects of entrepreneurial competence at the subsequent export expansion stage.

For example, if the riskiness of a firm fell as a result of a move abroad, then one can envision a negative relationship and also conclude that the move abroad paid off. Using detailed quarterly data over the period 1994-2004 on the distribution of Canadian banks' assets across countries, and broken down by risk category, the analysis simultaneously accounts for endogeneity and risk exposure. The results establish a causal relationship between DOI and performance, but find that the nature of this relationship varies by bank, and also depends upon the riskiness associated with each bank's foreign asset exposures. These causal relationships are robust to the introduction of two formal risk measures: credit ratings and share price volatility. The authors discuss policy implications of their analysis.

"We extend the work of Fattoum-Guedri, Guedri, and Delmar (2018) by suggesting that the number of family blockholders moderates the relationship between the distribution of voting power between family and nonfamily blockholders and firm performance. Building on power and negotiation theories, we argue that the participation of multiple generations of family members in the firm's ownership leads to greater diversity of perspectives that generates potential conflict over the distribution of resources. We highlight four power mechanisms-potential power, perceived power, power games, and realized power-to explain why family blockholders' conflicting and/or misaligned preferences, objectives, and visions for the family firm might influence the nature of the negotiation between the family and the nonfamily blockholder and impact family firm performance. We offer directions for future research.","['family business', 'power mechanisms', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'NEGOTIATION', 'SENSEMAKING', 'GOVERNANCE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'AGENCY']","['power mechanisms', 'negotiation', 'ownership']",['firm performance'],0.0,0.0
"This article uses evidence on the management of Information Systems (IS) expertise to critique conventional understandings of the management of expert groups. These tend to focus on problems of 'integration' or 'control' at the point of production. But this neglects the interplay between organizations and the wider structure of IS expertise; the latter being shaped by the evolving computer technology regime and the IS occupation's ability to colonize technological knowledge. In this context, the management of expertise is better viewed as an evolving series of 'problem-solutions'. 'Hybrid managers' and 'strategic information systems' are cited as instances of such problem-solutions.","['nan', 'INNOVATION', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'STRATEGY']",['organizations'],[],0,0.0
"The present paper establishes a relationship between language skills and career mobility. Due to increased internationalization, reduced job security, and a shift in career ownership to the individual, language skills represent a key career competence today. Using qualitative and quantitative data collected with a survey in Finland, we uncovered multiple career-related meanings for language skills. Language skills permeated the basic components of career competence - knowing how, knowing why, and knowing whom - and enabled respondents to cross boundaries. The respondents who possessed the best language skills also demonstrated the highest levels of both psychological and physical career mobility. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"Social capital refers to the resources derived from social relationships. Although the concept of social capital has been applied at the individual, group, and organizational levels of analysis, researchers have yet to fully embrace social capital's potential as a multilevel lens through which we might better understand management and organizational phenomena. With a central objective of advancing social capital's potential as a multilevel theoretical perspective, the authors make two contributions to the management literature. First, the authors comprehensively review two decades of management research to highlight how social capital has been empirically applied across levels of analysis.

"This paper demonstrates the relevance of consumers' susceptibility to interpersonal influence (CSII) in an investment context. In Study 1, a survey of individual investors, investment-related knowledge, psycho-social risks, and social needs emerge as antecedents that explain investors' susceptibility to informational and normative influence. In turn, susceptibility to normative influences increases transaction frequency, whereas susceptibility to informational influences decreases transaction frequency. The experiments in Studies 2 and 3 indicate the impact of interpersonal influences on consumers' investment decisions in a voluntary (free choice) and involuntary (confrontation) setting and check whether CSII moderates the impact of interpersonal influences. Consumers' investment choices are consistently influenced by the information and opinions of others, whereas CSII only strengthens the impact of interpersonal influence in a voluntary informational setting.","['Susceptibility to interpersonal influence', 'Investments', 'Reference-group influence', 'CONSUMER SUSCEPTIBILITY', 'NORMATIVE INFLUENCE', 'SOCIAL-INFLUENCE', 'SELF-CONFIDENCE', 'INFORMATION', 'CONSUMPTION', 'STOCK', 'PERSONALITY', 'STRATEGIES', 'PURCHASE']","['susceptibility to interpersonal influence', 'normative influence', 'information']",['transaction frequency'],0.0,0.0
"Prior research on strategic changes has asserted that long-tenured CEOs are less likely to initiate strategic changes. The authors argue that this assertion may exclude CEOs' prior experiences since it implicitly assumes that all new CEOs have the same inclination toward change. By viewing CEOs as individuals embedded within experiences and relationships throughout their careers, the authors propose that CEO newness-a concept integrating prior board experience, prior heir apparent experience, and length in the current position-can provide a more complete assessment of a new CEO's tendency toward change. They further argue that the impact of CEO newness on strategic changes will be moderated by the strategic distance between a focal firm and a CEO's previous firm, as well as by industry similarity between the two firms. The authors' analyses of U. S. computer firms from 1994 to 2007 support their arguments, suggesting that it is useful to adopt the concept of CEO newness while considering its boundary conditions in order to better understand strategic changes.","['CEO newness', 'CEO experiences', 'strategic changes', 'strategic distance', 'industry similarity', 'EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'STATUS-QUO', 'INDUSTRY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'FIRM', 'EXPERIENCE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'PERFORMANCE']","['ceo newness', 'strategic changes', 'strategic distance', 'industry similarity', 'industry', 'firm', 'experience']",['strategic changes'],1.0,0.14285714285714285
"Drawing on transaction cost economics theory, this study addresses the following research questions: (1) Does supplier involvement in market intelligence gathering activities have a greater impact on innovation success in predesign or commercialization activities? and (2) Does supplier involvement in market intelligence gathering activities have a greater impact on success in radical or incremental product innovation? Hypotheses are tested using both subjective and objective measures of success from a study of 205 incremental and 110 radical new product development projects. Results from the estimation of a two-group path model suggest that this theoretical framework is useful in providing guidance as to when product developers should emphasize the gathering of market intelligence through suppliers. Consistent with conventional wisdom, the findings suggest that supplier involvement in market intelligence gathering activities are positively related to success in incremental innovations across predesign and commercialization activities. However, supplier involvement in market intelligence gathering activities is found to have no significant impact on market share and is negatively associated with perceived product performance in radical innovations in predesign tasks. Also, while there was no significant difference in market share for supplier involvement in market intelligence gathering activities between radical and incremental innovation in commercialization activities, supplier involvement in these activities did have a greater impact on perceived product performance in radical innovation than it did in incremental innovation. Although current practice suggests that teams allocate fewer resources to the gathering of market intelligence through their suppliers during predesign activities in incremental innovation projects compared with radical innovation projects, the findings in this study suggest that they should do the opposite. Shifting resources allocated for engaging suppliers in market information gathering activities in predesign activities from radical innovation projects to incremental innovation projects could increase the return on these investments. Alternatively, these resources currently allocated to the gathering of market intelligence through suppliers in predesign activities of radical innovation projects could also provide greater benefits if allocated to commercialization activities of radical innovation projects, where they have the greatest positive impact.","['nan', 'TRANSACTION COST APPROACH', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'CHAIN', 'ORGANIZATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INTEGRATION', 'ADVANTAGE', 'BUSINESS']","['product development', 'involvement', 'performance']",[],0,0.0

"Research Summary: While extant research recognizes the importance of collective action for market formation, it provides little understanding about when and to what extent collective action is important. In this article, we develop a novel theoretical framework detailing what collective action problems and solutions arise in market formation and under what conditions. Our framework centers on the development of market infrastructure with three key factors that influence the nature and extent of collective action problems: perceived returns to contributions, excludability, and contribution substitutability. We apply our framework to diverse market formation contexts and derive a set of attendant propositions. Finally, we show how collective action problems and solutions evolve during market formation efforts and discuss how our framework contributes to strategic management, entrepreneurship, and organization literatures. Managerial Summary: This article lays out the key considerations that players operating in new markets should contemplate when making nontrivial investments in those spaces. As collective action problems can thwart efforts to establish new markets, we ask: When and under what conditions should market players collaborate rather than act independently? And if players collaborate, how should they coordinate to establish a new market? To address these research questions, we develop a novel generalizable framework of collective action in market formation. Our framework assesses the presence and type of collective action problems that hinder market formation and identifies potential solutions tied to those collective action problems.","['collective action', 'collective action problems', 'coordination', 'market formation', 'uncertainty', 'SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS', 'INSTITUTIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'INNOVATION', 'DYNAMICS', 'INDUSTRIES', 'LEGITIMACY', 'IDENTITY', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'PERFORMANCE']","['collective action', 'collective action problems', 'market formation']","['collective action', 'market formation', 'entrepreneurship']",0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666
"Emotional labor is the display of expected emotions by service agents during service encounters. It is performed through surface acting, deep acting, or the expression of genuine emotion. Emotional labor may facilitate task effectiveness and self-expression, but it also may prime customer expectations that cannot be met and may trigger emotive dissonance and self-alienation. However, following social identity theory, we argue that some effects of emotional labor are moderated by one's social and personal identities and that emotional labor stimulates pressures for the person to identify with the service role.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the alignment between product design and the supply chain and to identify how this alignment impacts on a firm's supply chain responsiveness and resilience. Design/methodology/approach - An in-depth case study methodology was adopted to uncover the strategies undertaken by one of the UK's fastest growing fashion retailers to create a competitive advantage through its management of the product design/supply chain alignment. Findings - The findings of this case illustrate that not only is the alignment of product design with the supply chain important in improving competitive advantage for the focal company, but it also has a significant impact in improving supply chain resilience and supply chain responsiveness. This case illustrates how fundamental shifts in the organisation, particularly in integrating product design and supply chain have enabled the repositioning of the company from a low priced fashion store to becoming a leading global fast fashion retailer. Practical Implications - The paper provides guidance for companies seeking to improve supply chain costs and performance by a higher alignment of product design and the supply chain. Originality/value - This case study highlights the importance of the product design/supply chain alignment and highlights the benefits of adopting a design centric approach. The findings from this paper also contribute to the growing debate on supply chain risk management.","['Product design', 'Supply chain', 'Supply chain risk management', 'Resilience and responsiveness', 'Fashion industry', 'INTEGRATING SUPPLIERS', 'SUCCESS FACTORS', 'LOGISTICS', 'RISK']","['product design', 'supply chain', 'supply chain risk management', 'risk']","['product design', 'resilience', 'case study', 'competitive advantage', 'resilience', 'chain risk management']",0.16666666666666666,0.25

The feeling of injustice experienced - and voiced - by some members of the largest British institute of auditors, the ICAEW, after it set up and operated a quality monitoring unit, serves to illustrate how change can turn awry when equity in a community of peers is threatened, and how institutional work can remedy such a situation by restoring a sense of worth in the community.","['audit profession', 'Boltanski', 'institutional work', 'quality control', 'Thevenot', 'United Kingdom', 'INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE', 'CHANGING NATURE', 'LOGICS', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'ACCOUNTANCY', 'FIELDS', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'BODIES', 'RISK']","['boltanski', 'institutional work', 'thevenot', 'institutional change', 'logics']","['institutional work', 'auditors']",0.5,0.2

"This paper presents the most comprehensive review and meta-analysis of the literature on cultural distance and firm internationalization to date. We analyze the effects of cultural distance on key strategic decisions throughout the entire process of internationalization. For the preinvestment stage, we examine the decisions on where to invest (location choice), how much to invest (degree of ownership), and how to organize the foreign expansion (entry and establishment mode). For the postinvestment stage, we examine the decisions of how to integrate the foreign subsidiary into the organization (transfer of practices) as well as the performance effects of cultural distance at both the subsidiary and the firm level. We find that firms are less likely to expand to culturally distant locations but if they do, they prefer greenfield investments and integrate subsidiaries more through transfer of management practices. Cultural distance does not seem to affect how much capital firms invest and whether they enter through a joint venture or full ownership. Interestingly, cultural distance has a strong negative effect on subsidiary performance but no effect on the performance of the whole multinational company. In addition, we find that the effects of cultural distance are not sensitive to time, but they are sensitive to the cultural framework used (e.g., Hofstede vs. Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness) and the home country of the company (developed vs. emerging market). Based on our study, we feel confident to offer some theoretical insights, recommendations for improving the validity and reliability of cultural-distance research, and ideas for future research.","['cultural distance', 'multinational companies', 'firm internationalization', 'meta-analysis', 'location choice', 'FDI', 'entry mode', 'establishment mode', 'transfer of practices', 'firm performance', 'subsidiary performance', 'FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'ENTRY MODE CHOICE', 'TRANSACTION COSTS THEORY', 'FILE DRAWER PROBLEM', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'INSTITUTIONAL DISTANCE', 'NATIONAL CULTURE', 'JAPANESE FIRMS', 'JOINT VENTURE', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY']","['cultural distance', 'firm internationalization', 'meta analysis', 'location choice', 'establishment mode', 'transfer of practices', 'subsidiary performance', 'joint venture']","['cultural distance', 'internationalization']",0.5,0.125

"We propose and test a multilevel model that positions trait curiosity as a key individual difference during the revision and evaluation stages of the creative process. Using a sample of T-shirt designers, their creative drafts, and the questions and comments that feedback seekers and providers posted to an online workshop, we find curiosity acts as a bridge connecting creative workers with their feedback providers in novel ways. We advance pliable guidance as a theoretical umbrella to describe how feedback seekers and providers in creative work find a balance between the direction that makes feedback informative and the freedom to explore that infuses new ideas in their work. Our findings show that more curious individuals seek feedback by asking more open questions, which allows them to obtain more feedback. We also find that ambivalent feedback is more likely to lead to feedback acceptance and design revision. Finally, our results suggest that curiosity is an important moderator of how creative workers respond to ambivalent feedback. Our research highlights the pivotal role curiosity plays in drawing individuals into a collaborative process when developing their creative ideas, one that is guided and inspired by the social environment.","['nan', 'EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY', 'MOTIVATIONAL ORIENTATION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-BEHAVIOR', 'INDIVIDUAL CREATIVITY', 'TEAM CREATIVITY', 'LANGUAGE USE', 'AMBIVALENCE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'DESIGN', 'METAANALYSIS']",['design'],"['curiosity', 'creative workers', 'creative work']",0.0,0.0
"Since the early 1990s, U.S. pharmaceutical firms have partially outsourced the coordination of the clinical trials they sponsor to specialized firms called contract research organizations. Although these exchanges appeared ripe for the development of close, embedded ties, they were in fact nasty, brutish, and short- i.e., marked by ill-will and a bias toward replacing current exchange partners due to perceptions of underperformance. Drawing on in-depth field work, we use causal loop diagrams to capture this puzzle and to help explain it. Our analysis suggests that attempts to build embedded relations will fail if the parties do not recognize the limitations of the commitments they can credibly make.

"In a freemium business model, the pricing of virtual goods with conspicuous features is a key challenge, because firms face a trade-off between increasing the total installed base and maintaining scarcity. In this study, we establish a model to facilitate this trade-off by considering a reference-based utility shift related to conspicuous consumption, and we offer the optimal pricing strategy for a monopoly firm, given different levels of snobbery. In addition, we provide guidelines for the firm on the conditions of introducing a freemium model. Our results reveal that the firm earns a growing profit by ratcheting up the premium price as the intensity of snobbery increases beyond a certain threshold, and in mild configurations, the firm earns a higher profit if it increases value discrepancy between the free and premium versions.

"Multinational corporations (MNCs) rely heavily on local employees when conducting their international operations, yet the international business literature provides few instances of true focus on these employees. The commonly used label host-country nationals (HCNs) confers them an identity strongly related to the culture of their country, prompting both researchers and practitioners to know them through the knowledge about the local culture. This paper provides evidence that a more sophisticated view of the culture of HCNs is needed: through an ethnographic exploration of HCNs working in local subsidiaries of American MNCs in Romania, I reveal that HCNs are not always culturally interchangeable with the rest of the host-country population. HCNs can display a variety of cultural profiles more or less reflective of the national culture, depending on their enacted stance towards the native culture and the cultural landscape of the MNCs themselves. The findings call for further specification of theories relying on the assumed localness of HCNs, and should contribute to the ongoing conversation on the interplay between the cultures specific to the MNC and its host countries.

"A growing reliance on customer reviews prompts firms to develop strategies to encourage customers to post online reviews of their products. However, little research investigates the behavioral consequences of writing a review. The act of sharing personal opinions through reviews is a rewarding experience and makes customers feel socially connected.

"Omni-channel supply chains provide customers with increased convenience to experience products and gather price information. Having more information under omni-channel retailing means customers can strategically choose where to purchase (which retail channel) and when to purchase (purchase now or later), which makes channel integration a challenge for omni-channel retailers. This paper focuses on the joint pricing optimization for omni-channel retailers. Specifically, we propose a randomized pricing strategy for omni-channel retailers by considering manufacturer's wholesale price, customers' discrepant perception between two channels, and customers' strategic-waiting behavior. Under this strategy, while the retailer offers a fixed price in the offline channel, it may randomly provide a discount according to a preset probability in the online channel to discriminate between customers and gain more profit. This study explores how the manufacturer's wholesale price and strategic customer behavior affect the randomized pricing strategy and profits for both omni-channel retailer and manufacturer. We show that if a randomized pricing strategy exists, it can benefit both the retailer and manufacturer. Finally, hiding the promotion probability is not always beneficial to the retailer. However, the retailer can benefit from price differentiation. Therefore, this study also provides guidelines to develop effective pricing strategies for omni-channel retailing.","['Retail supply chain', 'omni-channel retailing', 'randomized pricing', 'price discrimination', 'online retail', 'e-tail', 'online pricing', 'SUPPLY-CHAIN', 'DECISION-PROCESS', 'ONLINE', 'WHOLESALE', 'COMMERCE', 'PROMOTIONS', 'PLATFORMS', 'PRODUCT', 'IMPACT', 'MATCH']","['omni channel retailing', 'randomized pricing', 'supply chain', 'online', 'wholesale', 'product']","['retailing', 'randomized pricing strategy', 'waiting behavior', 'price differentiation']",0.0,0.0
"Ideas about the role of the organization in models of voluntary turnover remain scant. We posit that the social audience in general, and people working in organizations in particular, sort organizations into categories (organizational forms) and rely on knowledge of the taken-for-granted external identities of firms in these categories to interpret their experience as employees. Although many of these interpretations revolve around size, categorical distinctions between small and large firms pack concepts and ideas that extend significantly beyond a simple distinction based on size, and would be better understood as an organizational form distinction between specialist and generalist firms. Focusing on the organizational form of a specialist, we claim that two features of its form identity work against each other to influence turnover: employees of specialists realize that it is hard to develop careers internally (a push factor) but value the more relaxed environment, meaningful work, and flexibility of their jobs (a pull effect). We propose a theory to parse out the two effects, find empirical support for it in analyses of managerial turnover in the Korean TV advertising industry, and conclude that the construct of organizational form offers an opportunity to extend models of career mobility and individual turnover.","['nan', 'EMPLOYEE TURNOVER', 'NICHE WIDTH', 'JOB EMBEDDEDNESS', 'COLLECTIVE TURNOVER', 'LONGITUDINAL DATA', 'MOBILITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'DYNAMICS', 'SIZE', 'ECOLOGY']","['mobility', 'size']",[],0,0.0
"Would laterally displaying a healthy item to the left versus right of an unhealthy item influence choice and consumption? The results of seven studies demonstrate that displaying healthy items to the left (vs. right) of unhealthy items enhances preference for the healthy options. In addition, consumption volume of a healthy item (visa-vis an unhealthy item) is higher when it is placed to the left (vs. right) of the unhealthy item. We propose that a  healthy-left, unhealthy-right (vs. healthy-right, unhealthy-left) lateral display pattern is congruent with consumers' mental organization of food items varying in healthfulness, which enhances ease of processing and in turn enhances self-control, thereby leading to a relatively higher likelihood of choosing healthy options. While prior studies have examined the role of several factors in influencing choices between healthy and unhealthy options, the present research is the first to demonstrate the effects of lateral display positions of healthy/unhealthy options on choice and healthful consumption. The findings of our research have important implications for designing retail food displays and restaurant menus as well as for conducting research studies involving healthy and unhealthy food displays.","['healthy and unhealthy choices', 'lateral visual display position', 'food and beverage consumption', 'sensory marketing', 'SELF-CONTROL', 'READING HABITS', 'NUMBER', 'SPACE', 'REPRESENTATION', 'POSITION', 'PRODUCT', 'INFERENCES', 'MAGNITUDE', 'COGNITION']","['self control', 'position']","['choice', 'consumption', 'preference', 'self control']",0.25,0.5
"This investigation examines the potential adverse effects of planning strategic change on the employment relationship. We proposed that planning change can alter the psychological contract such that employees believe that organization obligations to the employee will diminish. We also argue that planning change may adversely affect employees' perceived obligations to the organization, their trust in management, and their intention to remain with the organization but that such effects depend upon whether employees perceive the planning process to be procedurally just. We tested these hypotheses in a longitudinal study of a utility company undergoing reengineering planning. The findings supported the proposition that reactions to planning change depend upon perceptions of procedural justice in that employee obligations and intention to remain were only adversely affected by planning when employees perceived the, process as unjust. Surprisingly, planning change did not significantly affect trust for employees who perceived the process as unjust and actually resulted in an increase in trust for employees who perceived the process as just. We discuss implications for practice and research. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

"Our research uses an interpretive approach to explore the consumer journeys of sojourners, temporary residents of a new country, with attention to cultural experiential goal pursuit and cultural brand engagement. Depth interviews with students from nine countries studying in America document that home country access to American popular culture impacts cultural experiential goals; the temporary nature of sojourners' stay engenders instrumental brand use (vs. brand attachment); and cultural brand engagement relies on indexical/iconic brand meanings inextricably tied to the desired cultural experience. Three cultural experiential goals and their brand engagement emerge: the imagined American cultural experience is grounded in American myths and stereotypes and iconic brand meanings; the unique Americana experience is grounded in Americana symbolism and indexical brand meanings with American symbolism; and the life like the locals experience is grounded in observed realities in America and indexical brand meanings.

"Drawing on a cross-organizational sample of 163 supervisor-subordinate dyads from mainland China, we examined the moderating effect of power distance and Chinese traditionality on relationships between perceived organizational support and work outcomes. We found that both power distance and traditionality altered relationships of perceived organizational support to work outcomes, in that these relationships were stronger for individuals scoring low (versus high) on power distance or traditionality. We also found that, compared to traditionality, power distance was a stronger and more consistent moderator of perceived organizational support-work outcomes relationships.

"We argue that the pressure MNE subsidiaries face to engage in corrupt practices in their host country varies positively with the institutionalization of corrupt practices in both host and home country environments. We further argue that the relationship between an MNE's home country environment and the pressure it faces in the host country is moderated by its localization strategy. Results suggest a positive relationship between the host country corruption environment and the pressure subsidiaries face to engage in bribery locally. Mixed results emerged concerning MNEs from home countries participating in the OECD Convention for Combating Bribery. Results concerning the impact of the home country corruption environment are best viewed in light of significant moderating effects. When MNEs did not have local partners, firms from less corrupt home countries reported less pressure to engage in corrupt practices locally; however, the presence of local partners eliminated this relationship. Results will help managers understand the pressures their firm is likely to face when operating in corrupt host country environments, and also offer guidance concerning how the firm might reduce its exposure to those local institutional pressures.

"Research Summary: With the recent growth of the sharing economy, regulators must frequently strike the right balance between private and public interests to maximize value creation. In this article, we argue that political competition is a critical ingredient that explains whether cities accommodate or ban ridesharing platforms and that this relationship is moderated in more populous cities and in cities with higher unemployment rates. We test our arguments using archival data covering ridesharing bans in various U.S. cities during the 2011-2015 period. We supplement these data with semistructured interviews. We find broad support for our arguments while mitigating potential endogeneity concerns. Our study has important implications for nonmarket strategy, entrepreneurship and innovation, and public-private partnership literatures. In addition, our fmdings inform policy debates on the sharing economy. Managerial Summary: Entrepreneurs and businesses oftentimes face severe regulatory barriers when commercializing innovative products and services even if the innovations are generally beneficial for consumers and the broader society. This research focuses on the political determinants of regulation to provide a better understanding of why some markets are more receptive to innovative products while other markets are more hostile to them. Using the banning of ridesharing companies (e.g., Uber and Lyft) in various U.S. cities during the 2011-2015 period, we find that elected politicians facing less political competition (i.e., not easily replaceable, serving multiple terms, longer tenure in office) were more likely to ban ridesharing companies and favor, potentially displaceable, local taxicab companies. Our research has implications for navigating the political barriers to entry.","['entrepreneurship', 'entry response', 'nonmarket strategy', 'platform-based markets', 'political barriers to entry', 'political competition', 'sharing economy', 'COMMERCIALIZATION STRATEGIES', 'CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS', 'INCUMBENCY ADVANTAGE', 'ENTRY', 'POLICY', 'MARKET', 'INFORMATION', 'GROWTH', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'FEDERALISM']","['entrepreneurship', 'nonmarket strategy', 'political barriers to entry', 'political competition', 'sharing economy', 'entry', 'policy', 'market', 'growth']","['sharing economy', 'competition', 'nonmarket strategy entrepreneurship', 'innovation', 'public private partnership', 'determinants']",0.16666666666666666,0.1111111111111111
"Although a growing literature indicates that cultural distance - that is, differences between national cultures - is an important determinant of organizational actions and performance, both empirical and theoretical concerns abound. In this study, the relationships of cultural distance with entry mode choice, international diversification, and MNE performance are examined by meta-analyzing data from 66 independent samples, with cumulative sample sizes ranging from 2,255 to 24,152. Regression results failed to provide statistical evidence of significant relationships between cultural distance and entry mode choice, international diversification, and MNE performance. The examination of moderator effects, however, yielded important results. We found a strong negative association between cultural distance and entry mode choice for US-based MNEs. The cultural distance international diversification relationship was negative for high-technology industries, while it was positive for other industries. Cultural distance also had a strong positive effect on MNE performance for developed country investments. A similar, strong positive relationship was found between cultural distance and international diversification in studies with more recent samples. Results of this study indicate that substantial additional research is needed before the role of cultural distance is fully understood.","['meta-analysis', 'cultural distance', 'measurement', 'WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'NATIONAL CULTURE', 'FOREIGN-MARKET', 'EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION', 'GLOBAL STRATEGY', 'UNITED-STATES', 'FIRMS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'MULTINATIONALS']","['cultural distance', 'national culture']",['entry mode choice'],0.0,0.0
"Purpose - Motivated by a lack of studies in graduate level supply chain education, this research aims to explore trends in supply chain-related graduate programmes in Europe and to propose a framework for designing such programmes. Design/methodology/approach - The authors determine knowledge and skills areas applicable to supply chain management (SCM) education and analyse supply chain-related graduate programmes published by the European Logistics Association in 2004. They revisit the same programmes in 2011 to determine the recent situation and the trends. The authors use cluster analysis to reveal the similarities and differences among these programmes. Findings - The authors find two distinct clusters: focused and diversified. Focused programmes offer modules in knowledge and skills areas apart from SCM at a negligible level and place more emphasis on SCM in 2011 when compared to 2004. Diversified programmes show a similar increase in the emphasis on SCM with more variety in the knowledge and skills areas. Research limitations/implications - The authors' findings are based on SCM programmes delivered in Europe and over two discrete time periods. Future research should seek to extend this analysis to other continents with larger samples and incorporate the industry perspective to determine the potential gap between what programmes offer and what industry requires. Practical implications - SCM-related graduate programmes continue to redefine themselves. Clustering predominantly serves the universities in reassessing and re-engineering their programmes, helps prospective graduates in their selection process and assists managers in their recruitment practices. Originality/value - This paper establishes a baseline for assessing SCM-related graduate programmes with respect to the knowledge and skills they offer and introduces a framework that may serve as a starting point for the design and positioning of such programmes.","['Supply chain management', 'Education', 'Cluster analysis', 'Europe', 'Graduates', 'Learning cycles', 'LOGISTICS', 'FUTURE', 'DEMAND']","['supply chain management', 'education', 'cluster analysis', 'europe', 'graduates', 'logistics', 'future']","['supply chain education', 'supply chain management', 'logistics', 'cluster analysis', 'selection']",0.6,0.42857142857142855
"Consumers are confronted with hundreds of new products each year, yet little is known about how these new products are integrated into existing knowledge structures. Depending on the new products' similarity or dissimilarity to categories stored in memory, consumers' information search may be influenced. In this study, consumers' information-seeking behavior was explored during the categorization of new products that differed in varying degrees from preexisting category expectations. Results suggest that subjects manage the cognitive effort of search by limiting the breadth of search. However, an inverted-U relationship exists between discrepancy and depth of search. Thus, it appears that, at a moderate level of discrepancy, subjects may examine a relevant set of attributes in greater depth rather than search for information on a broad range of attributes. With high discrepancy, however, it appears that subjects try alternative internal strategies rather than search for more information.","['nan', 'CONSUMER INFORMATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'OBJECTS']",['knowledge'],[],0,0.0
"This article investigates two competing explanations of the mere exposure effect -the cognition-based perceptual fluency/misattribution theory (PF/M) and the affect-based hedonic fluency model (HFM)-under incidental exposure conditions. In two studies, the classical mere exposure effect is replicated in the context of banner advertising. The findings rule out the cognition-based PF/M and suggest that the spontaneous affective reaction resulting from perceptual fluency is a crucial link between fluency and evaluation. The studies provide strong evidence that the spontaneous affect influences evaluative judgments through a more complex process, likely by coloring the interpretation of the fluency experience and the nature of resulting metacognitions relating fluency to liking. Theoretical and managerial implications of the findings are mentioned.","['nan', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'JUDGMENT', 'RECOGNITION', 'REPETITION', 'ATTITUDE', 'FLUENCY', 'MIND']","['judgment', 'fluency']","['misattribution theory', 'hedonic fluency model', 'judgments']",0.0,0.0
"This paper examines the entrepreneur's choice between bank finance and venture capital. With bank finance, the entrepreneur keeps full control of the firm and has efficient incentives to exert effort. With venture capital finance, there is a two-sided moral hazard problem as both the entrepreneur and venture capitalist (VC) provide unverifiable effort. The entrepreneur benefits from the VC's managerial input but must surrender partial ownership of the venture, thus diluting the entrepreneur's incentive to provide effort. Venture capital tends to be preferred to bank finance when VC productivity is high and entrepreneurial productivity is low. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

"Drawing on resource-based theory, the authors examine the extent to which firms redeploy three key marketing resources (brands, sales forces, and general marketing expertise) following horizontal acquisitions. Results from a survey of 253 acquisitions show that highly immobile resources are more likely than less immobile resources to be redeployed. Furthermore, resources tend to be redeployed from the acquirer to the target more often than in the reverse direction. Finally, the effects of redeployment on subsequent product costs, product quality, product line breadth, geographic market coverage, market share, and profitability are examined. Cost-based synergies were minimally affected, but revenue-based synergies and overall firm performance were significantly influenced.","['nan', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'FIRM', 'STRATEGY', 'BUSINESS', 'ASSETS', 'INTERNALIZATION', 'CAPABILITIES', 'INTEGRATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ORIENTATION']","['firm', 'performance']","['resource based theory', 'performance']",0.5,0.5
"We delineate three dimensions of resource allocation behavior that allow us to distinguish between real options logic and alternative resource allocation regimes: sequencing, low initial commitment, and reallocation. We then measure these in a product innovation context to test for the performance effect of real options logic vis-a-vis its alternatives. Sequencing, which distinguishes dynamic allocation regimes more generally, is associated with higher new product sales. Low initial commitment and reallocation do not show individual direct effects on new product sales. However, when assessed as a match, we find that the fit between low initial commitment and reallocation (yes-yes; no-no) increases performance significantly. After controlling for such fit as well as sequencing, we find no significant performance difference between real options logic and other regimes. Our findings imply that insufficient identification of real options logic picks up confounding effects, which may provide an explanation for the inconclusive results in prior studies of real options and performance. In addition to bounding the concept more precisely, we contribute to theory by situating real options logic within the broader set of allocation regimes conducive to innovation performance in uncertain, competitive markets.","['nan', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION', 'INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'DOWNSIDE RISK', 'INNOVATION', 'STRATEGY', 'INVESTMENT', 'FLEXIBILITY', 'FIRMS']",['innovation'],"['resource', 'product innovation', 'new product sales', 'fit']",0.0,0.0

"This research investigates the factors associated with the nature of conflict in the post-investment relationship between the venture capitalist (VC) and the entrepreneurial team (EP) in a venture that was funded by the venture capital firm, and as perceived by the VC. The study hypothesises a relationship between this perceived conflict and the post-investment performance of the investee firm. It examines both cognitive and affective conflict in two strategic areas-organisational goals and policy decisions-and relates them to the performance. The data was collected by a survey of VCs in the UK and a 60% effective response rate was achieved. The results show that conflict as disagreement can be beneficial for the venture performance, although at the same time, conflict as personal friction is negatively associated with performance. These impacts are in general stronger in the conflict related to organisational goals than to policy decisions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

"This paper offers a new explanation of the gender pay gap in leadership positions by examining the relationship between managerial bonuses and company performance. Drawing on findings of gender studies, agency theory, and the leadership literature, we argue that the gender pay gap is a context-specific phenomenon that results partly from the fact that company performance has a moderating impact on pay inequalities. Employing a matched sample of 192 female and male executive directors of U.K.-listed firms, we corroborate the existence of the gender pay disparities in corporate boardrooms. In line with our theoretical predictions, we find that bonuses awarded to men are not only larger than those allocated to women, but also that managerial compensation of male executive directors is much more performance-sensitive than that of female executives. The contribution of attributional and expectancy-related dynamics to these patterns is highlighted in line with previous work on gender stereotypes and implicit leadership theories such as the romance of leadership. Gender differences in risk taking and confidence are also considered as potential explanations for the observed pay disparities. The implications of organizations' indifference to women's performance are examined in relation to issues surrounding the recognition and retention of female talent.

"Knowledge production and scientific discourse are observable in published scholarly texts. Citations capture knowledge consumption and impact. Drawing from the sociology of science, our theoretical framework posits scientific communities as thought collectives with distinctive thought styles that embed a hidden topic structure and rhetorical signals into a journal's published articles. We hypothesize and uncover how an article's topic attributes (structure, focus, and newness) and rhetorical attributes (inclusiveness, exclusiveness, tentativeness, and certainty) are related to future knowledge consumption. We empirically test our ideas by applying text mining algorithms to model topics and extract rhetorical signals from 1,646 strategy articles composed of nearly 18 million words generating 172,237 citations over 35 years. We find that strategy articles' hidden topic structure explains 14% of variance in scientific impact. We also show that topic focus and topic newness each independently, directly, and significantly increase impact. As for newness, the first two articles published on a new topic each generate a citation premium >100%, which is higher within the focal thought collective than outside. Importantly, we find that the citation premium of newness increases with greater topic focus (which attracts attention) and greater inflow of prior intracollective knowledge (which enhances absorption). Impact also increases when authors present new topics using a rhetorical style that is more tentative than certain. Overall, our findings demonstrate that topic and rhetorical attributes, as constitutive elements of scientific content, are independently and interdependently related to the consumption of strategy articles across thought collectives in management research.","['scientific impact', 'management research', 'citation analysis', 'text mining', 'latent Dirichlet allocation', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH', 'INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE', 'CO-AUTHORSHIP', 'LANGUAGE USE', 'WORDS', 'CITATIONS', 'JOURNALS', 'ARTICLE', 'SCIENCE', 'IMPACT']","['scientific impact', 'management research', 'text mining', 'words', 'citations', 'article', 'science', 'impact']","['knowledge', 'discourse', 'consumption', 'impact', 'thought styles', 'topic structure', 'text mining']",0.2857142857142857,0.25
"Corporate accelerators (CAs) are a fast-emerging form of corporate engagement with startups. Equating them with independent startup accelerators and/or corporate venturing limits our understanding of how and why corporations run CA programs and to what end. In this inductive grounded theory study, we explore how corporations design and run CAs and to what effect. This study of four CM reveals that corporations manage accelerators via one of two distinct processes: namely, accelerating strategic fit or accelerating venture emergence. Our inductive models of these corporate acceleration processes provide new insights into how CM operate within corporations. Strategic posture and investment time horizon influence corporations' choice of acceleration path and their identification of potential ventures for acceleration. Our study deconstructs what comprises the core corporate acceleration processes and explains how the two pathways result in distinct outcomes nurturing innovations or nurturing ecosystems. We believe these findings can open up rich research opportunities for understanding how corporations engage with entrepreneurial ventures to enhance their entrepreneurialness.","['Corporate accelerators', 'Acceleration', 'Corporate innovation', 'Corporate entrepreneurship', 'Corporate-startup engagement', 'SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE', 'GROUNDED THEORY', 'VALUE CREATION', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'LEGITIMACY', 'INNOVATION', 'MODEL', 'WORK']","['corporate accelerators', 'acceleration', 'grounded theory', 'innovation', 'model']","['corporate accelerators', 'grounded theory']",1.0,0.4
"An increasing number of consumers rely on online reviews to make purchase decisions in today's global service industry. In this article, we investigate the impact of power on a consumer's willingness to spread word-of-mouth (WOM) by posting an online review. Drawing on self-enhancement theory, which suggests that an individual is motivated to spread WOM in order to boost his or her self-image, and the agentic versus communal theory of power, we argue that the impact of power is moderated by the valence of the customer's service experience, and its congruity with that of other forum users. Results from three studies in hotel and restaurant contexts indicate that powerless consumers are more likely to post positive reviews when the forum consensus is also positive. Conversely, powerful consumers are more likely to post positive reviews when the overriding consensus is negative. Further, such results hold only for positive (vs. negative) service experiences. Managerially, our findings suggest that introducing power mechanisms such as influence rankings or helpful votes into online consumer forums may shape review posting behaviors. Service marketers and social media managers need to be aware that some customer segments are not inclined to post positive online reviews. As indicated by our findings, powerful consumers, such as those with high helpful ratings or elite reviewer status, are more likely to post positive reviews when the forum consensus is negative. Conversely, powerless consumers, such as those with low helpful ratings or junior reviewer status, might be more inclined to post positive reviews when the forum consensus is also positive. Based on our findings, we also discussed the theoretical contributions, limitations, and ideas for future research.","['sense of power', 'experience congruity', 'self-enhancement motivation', 'online reviews', 'eWOM', 'WORD-OF-MOUTH', 'SELF-ENHANCEMENT', 'ENGAGEMENT BEHAVIOR', 'CONSUMERS', 'ESTEEM']","['online reviews', 'word of mouth', 'self enhancement', 'consumers']","['online', 'word of mouth', 'self enhancement theory', 'forum users']",0.25,0.25

"Prior scholarship has assumed that firm-specific and general human capital can be analyzed separately. This article argues that, in some settings, this is not the case because prior firm-specific human capital investments can be a market signal of an individual's willingness and ability to make such investments in the future. As such, the willingness and ability to make firm-specific investments is a type of general human capital that links firm-specific and general human capital in important ways. The article develops theory about these investments, market signals, and value appropriation. Then, the article examines implications for human resource management and several important questions in the field of strategic management, including theories of the firm and microfoundations of competitive advantage. Managerial summary: While managers don't often use the terms firm-specific and general skills, they certainly recognize that investments employees make in their skill sets are more or less relevant to a specific firm. For instance, investing in specific relationships within a firm or learning a firm's proprietary software would be considered firm-specific investments. While such skills may seem relevant only to the particular firm in which they were invested, these investments may also send valuable signals to competing firms that such employees are willing and able to make similar investments elsewhere. Hence, managers should be interested in determining if a potential hire has made prior firm-specific investments to help them know whether that person might be likely to make such investments in his or her future place of employment.

"Although pricing is one of the strongest drivers of profitability, little empirical research has examined how a firm should organize pricing internally. This research draws on the information-processing view of organizational design to conceptualize a framework of how firms organize their pricing authority both within the sales function and across the sales, marketing, and finance functions. The authors find a nonlinear, inverted U-shaped relationship between the vertical delegation of pricing authority and profitability as well as a positive relationship between the horizontal dispersion of pricing authority across sales, marketing, and finance and profitability. Another key finding is a positive interaction between vertical delegation and horizontal dispersion, indicating that firms need to jointly design vertical delegation and horizontal dispersion. In addition, the results identify price-related market dynamism as a moderator of the horizontal dispersion of the pricing authority-profitability relationship and emphasis on margin-based incentives as a moderator of vertical delegation of the pricing authority-profitability relationship.

"Third-party product reviews (TPRs) have become ubiquitous in many industries. Aided by communication technologies, particularly on the Internet, TPRs are widely available to consumers, managers, and investors. The authors examine whether and how TPRs of new products influence the financial value of firms introducing the products. An event study covering 14 major media and professional reviews of movies released by 21 studios shows that TPRs exert significant impact on stock returns in the direction of their valence. However, the impact comes from the valence of a review that is measured relative to other, previously published reviews and not from the absolute valence of the review itself. The authors further study the dynamics of TPR impact on firm value and find that the impact exists only for prerelease reviews and is the strongest on the product release date, though it disappears when sales information becomes available after product release. These results demonstrate that TPRs play significant roles as the investors update their expectation about new product sales potential. The authors also find that advertising spending increases the positive impact of TPRs on firm value and buffer the negative impact. Therefore, firms could strategically use marketing instruments such as advertising to moderate the impact of TPRs.","['third-party product review', 'advertising', 'professional reviews', 'media critics', 'firm valuation', 'movies', 'entertainment industry', 'event study', 'WORD-OF-MOUTH', 'FILM-CRITICS', 'INFORMATION', 'EARNINGS', 'SUCCESS', 'DEMAND', 'IMPACT', 'EVENT', 'NEWS', 'MANAGEMENT']","['third party product review', 'advertising', 'professional reviews', 'movies', 'event study', 'information', 'impact', 'event']","['third party product reviews', 'event study', 'valence']",0.3333333333333333,0.125

"Past research overwhelmingly suggests that relationship conflict (RC) has negative effects on team processes and performance. However, little research has investigated the effects of RC through a temporal lens with an eye toward overcoming the short-term deleterious consequences of RC. Integrating threat rigidity and threat regulation theories, we first argue that RC disrupts team processes over time because members feel threatened and, second, that cognitive reappraisal, as an emotion regulation strategy, is a threat regulation mechanism by which teams can overcome RC. Specifically, we examine the influence of early-stage RC on team process trajectories, the moderating effect of team-level cognitive reappraisal on these trajectories, and the team performance implications of team processes. Testing our predictions in both field and laboratory studies with conditional linear growth modeling, we show that while teams with high early-stage RC are lower initially on critical team processes (coordination and interpersonal processes), they incrementally rebound from these lower levels of team processes if team members have a tendency to cognitively reappraise past affective events. Further, we find that changes in perceived threat stemming from early-stage RC drives these effects. Finally, we find that as a result of managing early-stage RC through cognitive reappraisal, team performance does not suffer. Overall, these results suggest that teams can overcome the negative effects of early-stage RC by addressing underlying appraisals of threat, and that they may benefit in the long run from the struggle of doing so. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.","['relationship conflict', 'emotion regulation', 'team processes', 'EMOTION-REGULATION', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'INTRAGROUP CONFLICT', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'TASK CONFLICT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MODEL', 'INTELLIGENCE', 'REAPPRAISAL']","['relationship conflict', 'emotion regulation', 'team processes', 'emotion regulation', 'performance', 'model', 'reappraisal']","['relationship conflict', 'threat', 'cognitive reappraisal']",0.3333333333333333,0.14285714285714285
"The winds of creative destruction rarely blow more fiercely than in a newly deregulated environment. Managers simultaneously face a novel focus on operating efficiency and an onslaught of new competitors. What must managers do to enable their firms to survive in such an environment? What factors bear on firms' survival? This paper presents an analysis of mortality of large motor carriers in the U.S. interstate for-hire trucking industry after deregulation. It examines this phenomenon through a multidisciplinary lens that encompasses organizational ecology, neoclassical economics, and transaction cost economics. The paper posits that carrier mortality is a function of both firm-level and industry-level attributes, which are drawn from bath ecological and economic theories. While each of these theories separately informs motor carrier mortality, the inclusion of predictions derived from both disciplines in one model significantly increases explanatory power over either theory evaluated alone. The empirical analysis is among the first to show increased mortality when firms do not adhere to operating policies consistent with transaction cost minimization principles. In sum, managers are well advised to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to strategy to ensure their firms' survival: (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","['organizational mortality', 'transactional alignment', 'regulatory change', 'trucking', 'MANUFACTURING-INDUSTRIES', 'INTERNAL ORGANIZATION', 'ECONOMIC-PERFORMANCE', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'FIRM', 'SIZE', 'COMPANIES', 'DYNAMICS', 'MARKETS', 'ENTRY']","['trucking', 'empirical analysis', 'firm']",['survival'],0.0,0.0
"Virtually no research has examined the role of emoticons in commercial relationships, and research outside the marketing domain reports mixed findings. This article aims to resolve these mixed findings by considering that emoticon senders are often simultaneously evaluated on two fundamental dimensions, warmth and competence, and the accessibility of one dimension over the other is critically contingent on salient relationship norms (communal vs. exchange norms) in customers' minds due to individual and situational factors. Through laboratory and field experiments, the current research shows that customers perceive service employees who use emoticons as higher in warmth but lower in competence compared to those who do not (study 1). We further demonstrate that when a service employee uses emoticons, communal-oriented (exchange-oriented) customers are more likely to infer higher warmth (lower competence) and thus to be more (less) satisfied with the service (study 2). We also examine two practically important service situations that can make a certain type of relationship norm more salient: unsatisfactory services (study 3) and employees' extra-role services (study 4). We speculate on possible mechanisms underlying these effects and discuss theoretical and practical implications along with opportunities for future research.","['emoticons', 'warmth', 'competence', 'relationship norm orientation', 'unsatisfactory services', 'extra-role services', 'FUNDAMENTAL DIMENSIONS', 'EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION', 'RELATIONSHIP NORMS', 'SOCIAL COGNITION', 'COMMUNICATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'COMPETENCE', 'EXCHANGE', 'FEEDBACK', 'MOTIVES']","['emoticons', 'warmth', 'competence', 'unsatisfactory services', 'extra role services', 'fundamental dimensions', 'relationship norms', 'competence', 'exchange']","['emoticons', 'warmth']",1.0,0.2222222222222222
"Purpose - This paper aims to identify reverse flows and exchanges that support public service provision. Reverse flow literature has focused on manufacturing based supply chains using the lens of exchange (recovery, reuse, repair and recycle) to gain performance improvement in product flows. Limited research is available to support an understanding of customer-derived reverse exchange (RE) service processes. The authors contribute to the service literature through the development of RE antecedents and derive new and revised definitions with the supporting constructs of RE service processes. Design/methodology/approach - This paper synthesises literature creating a framework of antecedents for RE. Antecedents reflect differences of service flow (level of service inseparability and 'acting upon'). These antecedents are empirically tested within an illustrative pre-existing UK healthcare case study against the synthesised antecedents and existing RE definitions. Two teams of researchers reviewed the data generated from public service supply chain processes. Definitions of RE were either revised or derived from the empirical data by each team. Findings - The service concept of 'acting upon' for inseparable public service supply chain flows provides a basis for examining the existence of reverse flows and exchanges. Revised and new classifications to the RE model are proposed to stimulate contextual performance improvement and innovation in public service provision. Psychological utility is an additional feature to economic, environmental and social utility in public service RE. RE offers practitioners and academics a strategic operational competence to achieve improvement and innovation in public services and further advance this concept. Originality/value - Extending the literature beyond the manufacturing derived RE concept to develop an understanding of the customer's role in preserving and co-creating value in RE and flows in public service. New RE antecedents for public services, including the potential of psychological utility, are presented.","['Co-creation', 'Closed loop supply chains', 'Public sector', 'Customer value', 'Learning organizations', 'Healthcare service', 'SUPPLY CHAINS', 'INSTITUTIONAL ISOMORPHISM', 'INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY', 'HEALTH-CARE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LOGISTICS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'FRAMEWORK', 'CHALLENGES', 'MANAGEMENT']","['supply chains', 'performance', 'framework']","['reverse flows', 'public service provision', 'antecedents', 'antecedents', 'service inseparability']",0.0,0.0
"Entrepreneurship research has paid insufficient attention to the context in which new businesses are started Consequently, efforts to identify factors that consistently lead to entrepreneurial success have failed. This is because what works in one context will not necessarily work in another Even worse, factors that lend to success in one context may lend to failure in another. This article addresses this problem by drawing from the concept of industry evolution to identify three broad but distinct organizing contexts-emerging, growth, and mature industries-and demonstrating how each context presents a different set of entrepreneurial challenges. An industry is defined not as a group of firms producing close substitutes, brit instead as a group of firms of the same organizational form. Industry evolution is understood therefore as the diffusion of an organizational form, with emerging, growth, and mature stages corresponding to the creation, exploitation and erosion of competitive advantage. Defining an industry in this manner makes it possible to overcome the problem of shifting industry boundaries and enables us to distinguish between entrepreneurial activities that shake rep existing industries by creating new and competing organizational forms and entrepreneurial activities that replicate well-known organizational forms and drive an industry toward equilibrium. It also enables us to draw from the work of industrial organization economics, strategy, and population ecology. Entrepreneurship is defined as the creation of new organizations and is view,ed as a context-dependent social process. New organizations are enacted as critical stakeholders change their behaviors in ways that allow the organization to emerge. The process is successful when the short-term existence of a new organization is no longer at risk. A typological theory of entrepreneurial success is developed by examining how the fit between context and four other critical dimensions cause successful foundings. The theory is multiplicative and probabilistic. It is multiplicative in that all dimensions need to fit for a founding to be successful. Poor fit in any one area can lend to failure. It is probabilistic in that the better the overall fit the better the odds of success. In addition to context, the dimensions we examine are entrepreneurial networks, entrepreneurial confidence-building behaviors, the motivation of stakeholders, and organizational structures and strategies. In terms of entrepreneurial networks, we examine whether entrepreneurs have weak-tie or strong-tie networks, and whether their networks are homogeneous or include subgroups that are unrelated In terms of confidence-building behaviors, we explore the rise of informal (e.g., repeated personal interaction) versus formal (e.g., contracts) mechanisms. With respect to stakeholder motivations, we ask whether stakeholders are driven by social or instrumental motivations. In terms of structure and strategy, we consider two issues. First, we explore whether the emerging organization is market or hierarchy based and we consider the extent to which the organization is innovative versus imitative. We argue that these various dimensions come together in three logical configurations, that we label movements, bandwagons, and clones.","['nan', 'CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'CHALLENGES', 'TYPOLOGIES', 'CREATION', 'CONTEXT', 'FIRMS']","['organizations', 'challenges', 'creation', 'context', 'firms']","['industry evolution', 'firms']",0.5,0.2
"Social bookmarking Web sites are rapidly growing in popularity. Recommender systems, a promising remedy to the information overload accompanying the explosive growth in content, are designed to identify which unseen content might be of interest to a particular user, based on his or her past preferences. Most previous work in recommendation for social bookmarking suffers from lack of comparisons between the different available approaches. In this paper we address this issue by comparing and evaluating eight recommendation approaches on four data sets from two domains. We find that approaches that use tag overlap and metadata provide better results for social bookmarking data sets than the transaction patterns that are used traditionally in recommender systems research. In addition, we investigate how to fuse different recommendation approaches to further improve recommendation accuracy. We find that fusing recommendations can indeed produce significant improvements in recommendation accuracy. We also find that it is often better to combine approaches that use different data representations, such as tags and metadata, than to combine approaches that only vary in the algorithms they use. The best results are obtained when both of these aspects of the recommendation task are varied in the fusion process. Our findings can be used to improve the quality of recommendations not only on social bookmarking Web sites but conceivably also on Web sites that offer annotated commercial content.","['collaborative filtering', 'content-based filtering', 'data fusion', 'recommender systems', 'social bookmarking', 'SELECTION', 'SYSTEMS']","['recommender systems', 'social bookmarking', 'systems']","['social bookmarking', 'systems']",1.0,0.6666666666666666
"The apparent success of the U.S. model of capitalism as it developed in the 1990s and early 21st century encouraged many business and policy elites to regard it as an ideal form that should be adopted by other countries and regions. The recent collapse of the U.S. financial system and the current recession are, however, likely to limit the attractiveness of this U.S. model in both OECD1 countries and industrializing economies. In this article, I review the key features and limitations of the postwar U.S. economic model as well as the challenges to this model from the success of many Japanese firms doing business in the U.S. market and the rapid rise of the Asian tigers. Given the current situation, it is likely that the influence of the fully fledged market fundamentalist model, imposed on many Eastern European countries in the early 1990s, will be greatly diminished, and attention focused much more on alternative forms of capitalism. Most of these involve the state taking a more proactive role in economic development and regulation, albeit in market friendly ways.","['nan', 'POLICY']",['policy'],['firms'],0.0,0.0
"Although much saving research has been conducted in affluent nations, little is known about consumer saving and well-being at the base of the pyramid, which includes over 3 billion people who live on less than US$2.50 per day. Research evidence suggests that financial situation, and especially saving, is central to well-being in impoverished societies; however, to our knowledge, this relationship has not been tested with a global sample. Thus, in this study, we consider how societal poverty, individual saving ability, and satisfaction with one's household financial situation influence well-being. Further, we examine how poverty moderates the relationship between individual financial drivers and well-being to test the saving-well-being centrality assumption. Our multilevel study uses hierarchical linear models with about 50,000 consumers across 38 countries and demonstrates that as societal poverty increases, well-being decreases. Yet in high-poverty societies, saving greatly improves well-being. This significant finding among saving, poverty, and well-being is particularly telling, as household financial satisfaction was not moderated by societal poverty. As a result, we suggest novel transformative financial services that should improve the lives of the poor through formal saving mechanisms that are grounded in their lived experiences.","['saving behavior', 'financial services', 'impoverished consumers', 'MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE', 'SELF-DETERMINATION', 'CONSUMPTION', 'BANKING', 'BOTTOM', 'CONSTRAINTS', 'PSYCHOLOGY', 'INCLUSION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'CONSUMERS']","['financial services', 'knowledge', 'consumers']","['well being', 'base of the pyramid', 'societal poverty', 'satisfaction', 'financial satisfaction', 'financial services', 'experiences']",0.14285714285714285,0.3333333333333333
"P>This study examined the relationships between organizational justice and withdrawal outcomes and whether emotional exhaustion was a mediator of these linkages. Data were obtained from 869 military personnel and civil servants; using structural equation modelling techniques, we examined an integrative model that combines justice and stress research. Our findings suggest that individuals' justice perceptions are related to their psychological health. As predicted, emotional exhaustion mediated the linkages between distributive and interpersonal (but not procedural and informational) justice and individuals' withdrawal reactions. Results showed that distributive and interpersonal justice negatively related to emotional exhaustion and emotional exhaustion negatively related to organizational commitment which, in turn, negatively influenced turnover intentions. These findings were observed even when controlling for the presence of contingent-reward behaviours provided by supervisors and individuals' psychological empowerment.","['nan', 'SOCIAL-EXCHANGE', 'CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL EMPOWERMENT', 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'WORK ATTITUDES', 'INTERACTIONAL JUSTICE', 'TURNOVER INTENTION', 'MISSING DATA']","['psychological empowerment', 'turnover intention']","['commitment', 'empowerment']",0.0,0.0
"Using two complementary theoretical perspectives, we develop hypotheses regarding the determinants of the return required by venture capitalists and test them on a sample of over 200 venture capital companies (VCCs) located in five countries. Consistent with resource-based theory, we find that early-stage specialists require a significantly higher return than other VCCs when investing in later-stage ventures. Consistent with financial theory, we find that acquisition/buyout specialists require a significantly lower return than other VCCs when investing in expansion companies. Furthermore, in comparison to specialists, highly stage-diversified VCCs require a significantly higher return for early-stage investments, Independent VCCs require a higher rate of return than captive or public VCCs. In general, higher required returns are associated with VCCs who provide more intensity of involvement, have shorter expected holding period of the investment, and being located in the US or UK (in comparison to those in France, Belgium, and The Netherlands).

"Agent decision making occurs when an individual acts as a purchasing agent for another. Effective agent decision making requires that the agent learn to predict the target's preferences. Two experimental studies demonstrate the impact of providing agents veridical feedback. The results further our understanding of interpersonal prediction and learning from experience. Agents who are given the opportunity to learn from their own successes and failures do not exhibit the false consensus effect, or projection, that has been demonstrated in previous research. Any facilitative effect of similarity in tastes on predictive accuracy disappears when feedback is provided. Information theory is used to establish the informational value of individual instances, as well as an overall distribution of feedback. The results of the studies reported in the present article indicate that agents spend significantly more time considering informative than uninformative feedback, which improves their predictive accuracy.","['nan', 'MODEL', 'CONSENSUS', 'BIAS']",['consensus'],['information'],0.0,0.0
"This paper provides insight for practitioners by exploring the collective process of entrepreneurship in the context of the formation of new industries. In contrast to the popular notions of entrepreneurship, with their emphasis on individual traits, we argue that successful entrepreneurship is often not solely the result of solitary individuals acting in isolation. In many respects, entrepreneurs exist as part of larger collectives. First and foremost, there is the population of organizations engaging in activities similar to those of the entrepreneurs exist, which constitute a social system that can affect entrepreneurial success. In addition, there is also a community of populations of organizations characterized by interdependence of outcomes. Individual entrepreneurs may be more successful in the venturing process if they recognize some of the ways in which their success may depend on the actions of entrepreneurs throughout this community. Thus, we urge practitioners and theorists alike to include a community perspective in their approach to entrepreneurship. We also suggest that one way of conceptualizing the community of relevance might be in terms of populations of organizations that constitute the value chain. For example, in the early film industry a simple value chain with three functions-production, distribution and exhibition-is a convenient heuristic for considering what populations of organizations might be relevant. As we show in our case study of that industry, a community model offers insights into the collective nature of entrepreneurship and the emergence of new industries. Our basic thesis is that the role of entrepreneurship in the creation of new industries can be conceptualized in terms of the dynamics of a community of organizational populations. At least three implications of this view may be important for practitioners. First, the kind of widespread and fundamental economic and social change that has often been linked with entrepreneurship requires a variety of behaviors. While most definitions of entrepreneurship have recognized that entrepreneurship requires the introduction of innovation, they have tended to ignore the importance of behaviors that subsequently support that innovation. To encompass these important behaviors, we believe that a broad definition of entrepreneurial behaviors is justified. To capture this, the framework of entrepreneurial behaviors that we develop includes the variety of behaviors that are important to the success of a collective process of entrepreneurship. We believe that recognition of a variety of different behaviors that are important to the success of the entrepreneurial process can help practicing entrepreneurs to understand more fully the complex dynamics of new industry creation. In terms of our framework, the range of behaviors of potential importance to entrepreneurship includes all of the following: creating a firm that innovates, creating a new business that imitates the practices of others, innovating within an existing business, and imitating by creating change in an existing business. in addition, we recognize that the kinds of innovative change that support entrepreneurship in the context of new industry creation are not narrowly technological; other kinds of product and service changes as well as administrative innovations may also be relevant. Second, entrepreneurship in one part of the community often creates the opportunity for entrepreneurial activity elsewhere in the community. For example, the founding of movie palaces did not begin until feature length films appeared. The challenge for entrepreneurs is to recognize these opportunities and act on them. Third, and related the long-term success of entrepreneurial behaviors in one population of the community frequently requires that supportive entrepreneurial behaviors occur in other populations in the community. For example, the success of feature length films was hastened by the development of distribution organizations to replace traveling shows and localized markets. Their success was also hastened by the movement away from nickelodeons towards larger, more comfortable exhibition out lets, such as theaters and show palaces. When the interdependence among populations in the community is stated this way, another challenge to entrepreneurs becomes clear: the facilitation and encouragement of supportive behaviors in other populations. We are not the first to propose that the community is important, but we contribute to this idea by showing in aspecific context how various types of behaviors interact and ultimately promote entrepreneurship throughout the community. Our contribution for practitioners is twofold. We would urge practitioners to consider the variety of behaviors necessary to create, reinforce, and maintain fundamental and widespread change. Further, we would suggest that practitioners consider how activities in a broad community of organizations can set the stage for entrepreneurship and have a high impact on its ultimate success or failure. Thus, we would suggest that practitioners who seek to innovate should search broadly for opportunities and understand the importance of relations with businesses elsewhere in the community. The success of their entrepreneurial efforts may depend on the occurrence of supportive entrepreneurial changes in those businesses as well. Their ability to do this will be enhanced by a broad understanding of entrepreneurial behaviors and sensitivity to the opportunities that their entrepreneurial behaviors may create for others.

"Because of increasing ethical problems in business, organizations have tried to control these problems by institutionalizing ethics, such as by creating new ethics positions and formulating codes of ethics. In this study, the authors develop a scale for measuring the institutionalization of ethics in organizations and assess it for dimensionality, reliability and validity. Two separate studies are conducted, both using samples drawn from an American Marketing Association practitioner population. In Study 1, using a sample of 126 marketing practitioners, we performed exploratory factor analysis on 44 institutionalization items resulting in two separate dimensions of the institutionalization of ethics construct: implicit and explicit institutionalization. Using a national sample of 306 marketing practitioners in Study 2, we performed confirmatory factor analysis on these two dimensions and investigated the effects of these dimensions on perceived importance of ethics, job satisfaction, esprit de corps and organizational commitment. Implicit institutionalization had a significant direct affect on all four of these constructs. On the other hand, explicit institutionalization significantly influenced only the perceived importance of ethics.","['marketing ethics', 'institutionalizing ethics', 'implicit', 'explicit', 'CITIZENSHIP', 'SATISFACTION', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'MANAGERS']","['institutionalizing ethics', 'implicit', 'explicit', 'satisfaction']","['institutionalization', 'job satisfaction', 'organizational commitment']",0.0,0.0

"To distribute their products, luxury managers are dependent on single- and multi-brand stores; each of them generating approximately half of luxury personal goods revenues. However, both types of stores have specificities that require customized marketing strategies. The purpose of this research is to explore what differentiates single-brand from multi-brand settings. More specifically, we compare consumer decision-making processes in each type of store. We show that multi-brand stores offer less hedonic shopping experiences than single-brand stores, which raises consumers' desire to engage in exhaustive brand comparisons when purchasing luxury items. We find that activating hedonic goals reduces brand comparisons in multi-brand (but not in single-brand) settings. The effect of hedonic goals on brand comparisons is mediated by consumers' thinking style and moderated by the salience of consumers' status goals. These insights have important implications for luxury marketing managers when crafting differentiated strategies for single- and multi-brand environments. (C) 2019 New York University.

Four studies were conducted which concur with the findings of earlier research in this area and expand our knowledge about the effectiveness of semantic cues. Results indicate that between-store cues are perceived to be more effective than within-store cues at moderate price discount levels only when the cues are concrete in nature. In addition, a between-store cue resulted in more favorable evaluations than a within-store cue when the ad was viewed at home, but only when the cue was concrete.

"Crowdfunding campaigns, where entrepreneurs seek consumer funding to develop new products, foster dynamics that go beyond traditional seller buyer transactions. This research studies how consumers increase their participation when they believe their contribution is pivotal to product creation. Utilizing controlled experiments we find that making-the-product-happen motivates participation above and beyond the desire to help the entrepreneurs. Moreover, we show how this motivation, which increases when an all-or-nothing campaign is drawing to a close and its financing target is within reach, is driven by future product availability. Furthermore, we identify conditions where making-it-happen dominates herding and an increase in the backing actions of others decreases one's willingness to back. Lastly, consistent with the notion that individual backers can determine campaign success, an analysis of over 200,000 Kickstarter projects shows that 33% of all successful campaigns hinge on the marginal support of no more than three average backers.

"Whether an organization has a certain capability is often a matter of degree. Thus, in the context of initial learning of a capability, there is generally no clear-cut or automatic answer to the question of when art organization should be expected to cut back its learning efforts and affirm that the desired capability has been achieved. This paper offers a simple conceptual model for this question, based on the satisficing principle. More specifically, the question addressed is: 'When does overt learning stop?'-where 'overt' learning is understood as being marked by observable allocation of attention and resources to the task of acquiring the capability. The model provides the framework for a discussion of various influences on the aspiration level in the satisficing model, and hence on the nature of the capability that has been achieved when learning stops.

"The authors use the resource-based view of the firm to frame the direct, relative, and synergistic effects of three firm relational resources (i.e., customer relationships, business-partner social capital, and governing-agency social capital) on firm performance (strategic and financial) in a sample of 262 businesses that operate in metropolitan Chinese cities. Although the findings indicate that all three relational resources enhance performance, they also indicate that customer relationships are the primary drivers of strategic and financial performance and that business partnerships and governing-agency social capital have a synergistic influence. In addition, the results indicate that the influences of these resources are moderated by domestic or international firm ownership. The authors discuss the implications for academics and practitioners.","['nan', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'ECONOMY', 'NETWORK', 'TRANSLATION', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'INTEGRATION', 'COMMITMENT', 'INNOVATION']",['resource based view'],"['resource based view', 'firm', 'resources']",0.3333333333333333,1.0
"Electronic intermediaries ploy an important role in many Web-based electronic markets, adding value for participants by offering such services as matchmaking and trust. This paper presents an economic model of intermediation where the intermediary offers services to two types of actors: consumers and providers. When consumers are heterogeneous, differentiated by their willingness to pay for intermediation, the intermediary can potentially offer two (or more) levels of service quality to target different consumer segments. The analysis in this paper highlights he aggregation benefit that consumers derive from having access to multiple providers through the intermediary. According to prior research on vertically differentiated digital goods, it is optimal to offer only one quality level in the market, because segmentation causes cannibalization and lowers profits. In the case of intermediation, however, the aggregation benefit makes it optimal for the intermediary to offer both levels of service. The intermediary's profits increase when the quality of the lower-quality service is decreased, suggesting that the two quality levels should be differentiated as much as possible. If the aggregation effect is intense, the intermediary should make the service free for providers.","['electronic markets', 'intermediation', 'price discrimination', 'pricing of software services', 'network effect', 'vertical differentiation', 'NETWORK EXTERNALITIES']","['electronic markets', 'intermediation']","['willingness to pay', 'service quality']",0.0,0.0
"Leader behaviors are dynamic and vary over time, and leaders' actions at a given time can have ramifications for their subsequent behavior. Taking such a dynamic perspective on leader behaviors, we examined daily servant leadership behavior and its downstream effects on the leaders themselves from a within-person self-regulation perspective. Results from two experience sampling studies consistently revealed that engaging in daily servant leadership behavior can come at a cost for the leaders. Specifically, for leaders who are low in perspective taking, engaging in servant leadership behavior was associated with increases in same-day depletion and next-day withdrawal from their leadership role (i.e., greater laissez-faire behavior). However, for leaders who frequently exercise perspective taking, engaging in daily servant leadership behavior was instead associated with decreases in depletion and subsequent laissez-faire behavior, suggesting that servant leadership behaviors are replenishing for these individuals. Experience in perspective taking is therefore a key individual difference that determines whether enacting servant leadership behavior is beneficial or detrimental for leaders. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of our findings and provide avenues for future leadership research.","['servant leadership behavior', 'self-control depletion', 'experience sampling', 'SELF-CONTROL', 'EGO DEPLETION', 'REGULATORY FOCUS', 'PERSPECTIVE-TAKING', 'SLEEP-DEPRIVATION', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'EMPOWERING LEADERSHIP', 'INITIATING STRUCTURE', 'RESOURCE-ALLOCATION', 'MULTILEVEL MODELS']","['servant leadership behavior', 'experience sampling', 'perspective taking']","['leader behaviors', 'self regulation', 'perspective taking', 'depletion', 'laissez faire']",0.2,0.3333333333333333
"In marketing, compared with other organizational dimensions such as leadership, culture, structure, and processes, relatively scant attention has been devoted to the effect of strategy on firm performance, especially in the global context. Rapid globalization of markets, along with ever-increasing dynamic demands on the marketing organization, necessitates a new examination. This article reports on a study that examines the role of strategy and other organizational forces on the performance of globally focused marketing organizations headquartered in Norway, Sweden, and the United States. The general findings indicate that (1) the constructs of leadership, strategy, and culture precede the globally focused marketing organization's structure; (2) strategy precedes structure; and (3) organizational structure and processes influence marketing and financial performance. Many relationships appear to be consistent across countries, and some are uniquely tied to the home-country markets.","['nan', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'STRATEGY', 'EVOLUTION', 'STANDARDIZATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'MULTINATIONALS', 'CONFIGURATIONS', 'CAPABILITIES', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'COMPANIES']",['strategy'],"['performance', 'financial performance']",0.0,0.0
"A parsimonious framework linking advertising expenditures and research and development expenditures to brand value, and brand value in turn to firm-level financial performance, was proposed and empirically investigated under four data conditions: data form, brand type, financial performance metric, and lag structure. Using pooled data from 125 firms (848 firm-year observations) over the period 1991-2007, 108 path analyses were conducted to compute five path model output metrics. Data on these metrics were then compared for each of the data conditions by means of analysis of variance. Although significant relationships were generally observed among framework variables, study results differed considerably across three of the four data conditions. The principal take-away from the study is that the impact of marketing activities on firm-level financial performance is likely to be in large part a function of the specific research purpose and methodology employed. As such, the take-away has implications when interpreting value-relevance findings, when constructing theories involving market-based assets, and when designing studies to investigate relationships between marketing and financial performance.","['Advertising expenditures', 'R&D expenditures', 'Brand value', 'Firm-level financial performance', 'SHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'VALUE-RELEVANCE', 'VALUE CREATION', 'MARKET VALUE', 'INFORMATION', 'VALUATION', 'STRATEGY', 'CAPITALIZATION', 'AMORTIZATION', 'PRODUCTIVITY']","['advertising expenditures', 'brand value', 'firm level financial performance', 'value relevance']","['research and development', 'performance']",0.0,0.0
"This article considers the evolution of interfirm networks within a context of technological change. More specifically, it studies the evolution of structural and positional embeddedness in a network of technology-based alliances when it moves from an early period of invention creation to a subsequent period of new product development and commercialization. Empirically, we study the evolution of technology-based alliance networks in the biopharmaceutical industry over a period of about 25 years, from 1975 until 1999. Examining interorganizational networks over such an extended time period allows us to move beyond more static approaches that have characterized most network studies until now, and consider network evolution along its various phases of birth, growth, and early maturation instead. Our findings indicate that the evolution of both structural and positional embeddedness does not follow the common idea of a path of linear progression, but instead strongly exhibits nonlinearity by resembling a sigmoid pattern. These findings have a number of implications. First, the break in the process of linear progression contrasts with the standing literature that (implicitly) assumes the informational and resource value of a network structure to remain constant over time or to evolve linearly from carrying low value to progressively higher value. Instead, our finding that the evolution of structural and positional embeddedness is nonlinear echoes the speculative idea, as expressed by Gulati and Garguilo, that network change may possibly be nonlinear when seen over the long run. A second implication concerns the validity of standing insights from the social network literature such as Coleman's theory of social capital and Burt's theory of structural holes. These theories may not apply to the extent that there are strong changes in environmental conditions like environmental uncertainty and/or munificence, such as during a transition phase as considered in this study.","['nan', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'OPEN INNOVATION', 'PATTERNS', 'BIOTECHNOLOGY', 'DISCONTINUITIES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'GOVERNANCE', 'DETERMINANTS']",['product development'],['interorganizational networks'],0.0,0.0
"Price plays two distinct roles in consumers' evaluations of product alternatives: as a measure of sacrifice and as an informational cue. This article merges two streams of empirical research into the effects of price on consumers' product evaluations by combining stated preferences, obtained from conjoint measurement, with data on self-reported measures in the form of beliefs or attitudes. It thus offers new, substantive insights into the dual role of price. Specifically, it differentiates between the informational and sacrifice effects of price using a choice-based conjoint approach and differentiates further among different subcomponents of these two main effects by combining choice-based measures with self-reported measures that pertain to potential sources of the dual role of price (price response drivers) and underlying consumer characteristics. Thus, this article presents a general procedure to quantify the impact of the dual role of price on choice shares for product alternatives within a market simulation. This procedure enables managers to simulate the choice share effects of changes in price response drivers, as well as modifications in segmentation and targeting strategies that involve changes in the levels of the price response drivers and thus the levels of the informational and sacrifice components of the price response of demand.","['dual role of price', 'informational effect', 'sacrifice effect', 'BRAND-NAME', 'EMPIRICAL GENERALIZATIONS', 'BUYERS PERCEPTIONS', 'PURCHASE BEHAVIOR', 'QUALITY', 'SIGNALS', 'MODEL', 'INFORMATION', 'PRODUCTS', 'SEARCH']","['dual role of price', 'sacrifice effect', 'information', 'search']",[],0,0.0
"Entrepreneurs are often described as overconfident (or at least very confident), even when entering difficult markets. However, recent laboratory findings suggest that difficult tasks tend to produce underconfidence. How do entrepreneurs maintain confidence in difficult tasks? Our two laboratory experiments and one archival study reconcile the literature by distinguishing types of overconfidence and identifying what type is most prominent in each type of task. Furthermore, we critically examine the notion that overconfidence' explains excess market entry: we find that entry into different markets is not driven by confidence in one's own absolute skill, but by confidence in one's skill relative to that of others. Finally, we consider whether overconfidence in relative skill is driven by neglecting competitors or by systematic errors made when considering them.

"Customer cocreation during the innovation process has recently been suggested to be a major source for firms' competitive advantage. Hereby, customers actively engage in a firm's innovation process and take over innovation activities traditionally performed by a firm's employees. Despite its suggested importance, previous research has revealed contradictory findings regarding its impact, the nature of involved customers, and the channels of communication that enable cocreation. To provide a more fine-grained picture, customer cocreated knowledge is first delineated into its key value dimensions of relevance, novelty, and costs, and then their impact on various innovation outcomes is investigated. Next, the study examines the antecedent role of customer determinants; that is, lead user characteristics and customer-firm closeness, on these knowledge value dimensions. Finally, we explore how these effects are moderated by the type of communication channel used. An empirical validation of the conceptual model is performed by means of survey data from 126 customer cocreation projects. The data analysis indicates that customer cocreation is most successful for the creation of highly relevant but moderately novel knowledge. Cocreation with customers who are closely related to the innovating firm results in more highly relevant knowledge at a low cost. Yet, cocreation with lead users produces novel and relevant knowledge. These effects are contingent on the richness and reach of the communication channels enabling cocreation. Overall, the findings shed light on opportunities and limitations of customer cocreation for innovation and reconcile determinants originating in relationship marketing and innovation management. At the same time, managers obtain recommendations for selecting customers and communication channels to enhance the success of their customer cocreation initiatives.","['nan', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'INTERFIRM RELATIONSHIPS', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'DOMINANT LOGIC', 'LEAD USERS', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'INFORMATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CREATION', 'SUCCESS']","['lead users', 'creation', 'success']",['competitive advantage'],0.0,0.0
"Political skill is a construct that was introduced more than two decades ago as a necessary competency to possess to be effective in organizations. Unfortunately, despite appeals by organizational scientists to further develop this construct, it lay dormant until very recently. The present article defines and characterizes the construct domain of political skill and embeds it in a cognition-affect-behavior multilevel, meta-theoretical framework that proposes how political skill operates to exercise effects on both self and others in organizations. Implications of this conceptualization are discussed, as are directions for future research and practical implications.","['political skill', 'social competency', 'interpersonal style', 'influence', 'astuteness', 'PROACTIVE PERSONALITY', 'IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT', 'LEADER REPUTATION', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'RESOURCES', 'WORKPLACE', 'ANTIDOTE', 'ADAPTABILITY', 'CONSERVATION', 'VALIDATION']",['political skill'],"['political skill', 'self']",0.5,1.0
"This study empirically tested the contingency relationship between strategy and structure proposed by Chandler and others with hypotheses linking the probability, timing, and magnitude of changes in one attribute to changes in the other attribute. A dynamic analysis of 262 large firms observed over 28 years generally supported the hypotheses, indicating a reciprocal relationship between strategy and structure. However, our results support the original conception of a hierarchical relationship between the two-strategy is a more important determinant of structure than structure is of strategy.","['nan', 'CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION', 'MULTIDIVISIONAL STRUCTURE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FIRMS', 'FORM', 'MOMENTUM', 'SIZE', 'DIVISIONALIZATION', 'PERSPECTIVES']",['firms'],"['strategy', 'structure']",0.0,0.0
