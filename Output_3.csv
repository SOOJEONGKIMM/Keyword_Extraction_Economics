"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to introduce the concept of social welfare chain and address the challenges in decision making through the development of an optimal planning model for a nongovernmental organization (NGO). The distinctive properties of the social welfare chain and its relationship with the humanitarian relief chain in the context of supply chain management are also discussed. The paper presents a real decision problem and analyzes the managerial impacts of the proposed solution. Design/methodology/approach - The study of social welfare policy and the review of the humanitarian literature has necessitated the introduction of the social welfare chain. Based on its definition, an optimal facility location distribution model that consolidates the non-integrated style of logistics functions with a cost minimizing approach is developed. The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is used in order to optimize the coal distribution model of an NGO. Data is obtained from an NGO that aims to help vulnerable people through distributing coal and basic food such as rice and sugar. Findings - Besides laying the foundations of social welfare chain, an analytical tool for decision support systems of the NGOs can be considered as the major finding of the research. Despite the increased number of stages in the proposed network configuration, the optimal solution resulted in significant cost reduction and distribution efficiency due to the availability of temporary distribution center locations at no extra cost. Furthermore, this study brings out the advantages of using intermodal transportation in the distribution process of cost-sensitive networks. Practical implications - This paper provides a detailed analysis that contributes to the efficiency and the effectiveness of social welfare chains. Moreover, it represents a cooperation established between university and NGOs. Originality/value - The planning efforts of nongovernmental organizations targeting at the periodical aids to improve the social welfare level have received little attention in the literature. This paper is the first to propose the concept of Social Welfare Chain, at the same time addressing the distribution planning for the NGO.","['Social welfare', 'Supply chain management', 'Non-governmental organizations', 'Aid agencies', 'Optimization techniquesDISASTER RELIEF', 'SUPPLY CHAINS', 'HUMANITARIAN AID', 'LOGISTICS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PREPAREDNESS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CHALLENGES', 'OPERATIONS', 'DELIVERY']","['social welfare', 'social welfare', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'logistics', 'management', 'challenges']",supply chain management facility location support systems
"Firms are creating a digitized selling capability by developing Web sites designed to provide information and conduct transactions with customers, replacing many routine sales force activities. The authors use the motivation-ability framework to shape a conceptual model that examines the effects of the digitization of selling activity on two salesperson outcomes: salesperson effectiveness and salesperson job insecurity,,. Using data from salespeople in 168 firms, they assess the moderating effects of environmental-level motivational factors and firm-level ability factors on the impact of digitization of selling activity on salesperson effectiveness and job insecurity. The results reveal that digitization has the paradoxical affect of improving salesperson effectiveness and heightening job insecurity concerns, and also that managers can improve the technology-enabled multichannel capabilities of the firm by giving priority attention to human capital improvement, sales force control systems, and communication of the digitization strategy.","['digitization of selling capabilities', 'sales force performance', 'sales force controls', 'job insecurity', 'technology', 'enabled multichannel capabilityINFORMATION', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'FIRM', 'DETERMINANTS', 'ISOMORPHISM', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'ADOPTION', 'DEMAND', 'IMPACT']","['job insecurity', 'job insecurity', 'technology', 'technology', 'firm', 'impact']",salespeople
"This article discusses whether family ownership affects a firm's adoption of flexible manpower and organization practices. The results presented in the article show that the important divide is not between family-owned and nonfamily businesses: family businesses with a professional top manager differ from nonfamily firms only as regards one of seven flexibility measures. More important is whether the owners choose to be in charge of the day-to-day running of the firm themselves (owner-management) or leave it to a professional manager. In owner-managed family businesses, five out of seven practices for increased flexibility prevail less frequently than in both family businesses with a professional manager and nonfamily firms. Owner-managers are, then, more skeptical of adopting new management principles and personnel policies than are professional managers.","['nanOWNERSHIP', 'FIRMS', 'CONTRACTORS']",['firms'],management
"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to soon replace human drivers and promise substantial benefits to society. Yet, consumers remain skeptical about handing over control to an AV. Partly because there is uncertainty about the appropriate moral norms for such vehicles (e.g., should AVs protect the passenger or the pedestrian if harm is unavoidable?). Building on recent work on AV morality, the current research examined how people resolve the dilemma between protecting self versus a pedestrian, and what they expect an AV to do in a similar situation. Five studies revealed that participants considered harm to a pedestrian more permissible with an AV as compared to self as the decision agent in a regular car. This shift in moral judgments was driven by the attribution of responsibility to the AV and was observed for both severe and moderate harm, and when harm was real or imagined. However, the effect was attenuated when five pedestrians or a child could be harmed. These findings suggest that AVs can change prevailing moral norms and promote an increased self-interest among consumers. This has relevance for the design and policy issues related to AVs. It also highlights the moral implications of autonomous agents replacing human decision-makers.","['morality', 'autonomous vehicles', 'control', 'responsibility', 'harmJUDGMENT', 'ETHICS', 'CAUSAL', 'MIND']","['morality', 'autonomous vehicles', 'autonomous vehicles', 'control', 'responsibility']",autonomous vehicles moral norms morality self judgments attribution of responsibility
"Drawing on agency and configurations theories, this study examines how perceived level of control over the entrepreneur influences venture capitalist (VC) decision making. We model the direct effects of perceived control and the interactive effects of control with entrepreneurial prestige and opportunity attractiveness to determine how various combinations of factors influence VCs' willingness to invest. We test our conceptualizations using conjoint analyses of 552 VC investment decisions. The results show that perceived control is directly related to investment likelihood, but different configurations of control, entrepreneur prestige, and opportunity attractiveness result in different outcomes. Our findings support a configurational perspective of VC decision making.","['nanMORAL HAZARD', 'CONJOINT-ANALYSIS', 'AGENCY THEORY', 'OPPORTUNITY', 'IMPACT', 'FIRMS', 'ENTREPRENEURS', 'EQUIFINALITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGY']",['opportunity'],investment
"In this study, we explain how multinational enterprises (MNEs) respond to pressure to conform to their stakeholders' expectations for greater attention to corporate social responsibility (CSR). We invoke institutional theory to propose that mounting stakeholder pressure in an MNE's home country leads to the transfer of socially irresponsible practices from its headquarters to its overseas subsidiaries. This transfer is more pronounced when a subsidiary is apparently unconnected to an MNE, yet is controlled by an MNE's headquarters through the appointment of the subsidiary's board members; the institutional environment of the MNE's home country enforces compliance; and the degree of institutional enforcement, vigilance, and sanctions for noncompliance in the subsidiary's host country is low. Our hypotheses are empirically supported using panel data on 269 subsidiaries in 27 countries belonging to 110 MNEs from 22 countries. Results are robust to alternative measures, explanations, and sample.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL LEGITIMACY', 'CORPORATE-RESPONSIBILITY', 'INSTITUTIONAL THEORY', 'BUSINESS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TIES', 'REEXAMINATION', 'INVESTMENT', 'STANDARDS', 'RESPONSES']","['institutional theory', 'institutional theory']",multinational enterprises institutional theory data
"Relational governance and control mechanisms are important means of managing interfirm relationships. Yet, the effectiveness of different governance mechanisms remains equivocal, especially in the international context. In this study, the authors investigate the value of relational and control governance across relationship length. Using a survey of 217 export ventures from China, they find that relational governance is not effective for short-term relationships but that it becomes effective in the long run. Output control improves export performance across short- and long-term relationships, whereas process control has its limits and weakens export performance for short-term relationships. In addition, the findings show that relational governance positively moderates the effects of output and process control on export performance for long-term relationships.","['relational governance', 'output control', 'process control', 'relationship length', 'export performanceINTERNATIONAL MARKETING CHANNELS', 'COMMON METHOD VARIANCE', 'EXCHANGE RELATIONSHIPS', 'DISTRIBUTOR RELATIONSHIPS', 'BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS', 'SUPPLIER OPPORTUNISM', 'DARK SIDE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONTRACTS', 'TRUST']","['relational governance', 'relational governance', 'output control', 'output control', 'process control', 'process control', 'relationship length', 'relationship length', 'performance']",relational governance
"The central cultural contradiction of capitalism, argued Bell some 25 years ago, was the existence of rationalized, disciplined production alongside free and hedonistic consumption. This paper argues that this thesis, although overstated, has resonance within contemporary capitalism. The paper then considers the question of how this contradiction is managed when production and consumption meet directly within the service interaction. On the production-side rationalization is joined by customer-orientation, and on the consumption-side management promotes consumption of the enchanting myth of sovereignty. Here the customer is meant to experience a sense of being sovereign. At the same time the space is created for the customer to be, potentially, substantively directed and influenced to follow the requirements that flow from the rationalized elements of production. Key aspects of the service interaction, including the menu and its presentation, the display of empathy and aesthetic labour, and the use of naming within the service interaction, are analysed in terms of the promotion of the enchanting myth of sovereignty. Consumption, however, is a fragile process, and remains, to an important degree, 'unmanageable'. The analysis, therefore, also examines how the promotion of the enchanting myth of sovereignty systematically creates the conditions for the myth's negation.","['nanSERVICE WORK', 'MANAGEMENT', 'LIFE']",['management'],consumption
"The world of retailing has changed dramatically in the past decade. The advent of the online channel and new additional digital channels such as mobile channels and social media have changed retail business models, the execution of the retail mix, and shopper behavior. Whereas multi-channel was in vogue in the last decade in retailing, we now observe a move to so-called omni-channel retailing. Omni-channel retailing is taking a broader perspective on channels and how shoppers are influenced and move through channels in their search and buying process. We discuss this development conceptually and subsequently discuss existing research in this multi-channel retailing. We also introduce the articles in this special issue on multi-channel retailing and position these articles in the new omni-channel movement. We end with putting forward a research agenda to further guide future research in this area. (C) 2015 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Using 456 supervisor-employee dyads from four organizations, this study examined how employees use one proactive behavior, feedback seeking, as a strategy to enhance their creative performance. As hypothesized, employees' cognitive style and perceived organizational support for creativity affected two patterns of feedback seeking: the propensity to inquire for feedback and the propensity to monitor the environment for indirect feedback. Feedback inquiry related to supervisor ratings of employee creative performance. These results highlight the importance of employees' self-regulatory behaviors in the creative process and show that feedback seeking is not only a strategy that facilitates individual adaptation, but also a resource for achieving creative outcomes.","['nanKIRTON ADAPTION-INNOVATION', 'LEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'PERCEIVED ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT', 'EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY', 'COGNITIVE-STYLE', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT', 'INFORMATION-SEEKING', 'GOAL ORIENTATION', 'STRATEGIES']","['perceived organizational support', 'perceived organizational support', 'perceived organizational support', 'cognitive style', 'cognitive style']",cognitive style
"Consumers can obtain skill-based products through a variety of acquisition modes, such as purchase or rental. Despite the rise of nonpurchase acquisition modes, surprisingly little research has explored the effects of differential acquisition modes on consumer behavior. This research begins to fill this gap in the literature by examining the effect of acquisition mode on the expected time necessary to master newly adopted skill-based products and the downstream consequences for consumers and marketers. Results of four experiments and a field study show that purchasing, versus renting, products requiring skill-based learning increases the amount of time consumers expect to be required to master them. Further, the differences in speed of product mastery, in turn, impact subsequent consumer behavior via differential levels of product use commitment.","['ownership', 'renting', 'skill-based products', 'social comparison', 'relative ability', 'product-use commitmentSOCIAL COMPARISONS', 'SELF-ESTEEM', 'PREFERENCES', 'EXPERIENCE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'CATEGORIZATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'CONSUMPTION', 'COMMITMENT', 'MECHANISMS']","['renting', 'skill based products', 'skill based products', 'skill based products', 'commitment']",learning commitment
"The African continent is rapidly growing its global economic impact and becoming a more attractive sourcing context. However, very little is known about current purchasing practices, successes and challenges on this continent. The authors investigate the specific features that characterize supply management in Africa by conducting a systematic review of the literature on sourcing in and from Africa. Their aim is to help scholars direct their future research efforts. The authors take a thematic approach in their analysis of 57 articles, and identify key findings, research challenges and opportunities. They focus on four areas previously identified as distinguishing the sourcing context in Africa: African culture and ethics; the role of African countries and suppliers in global value chains; an increasing emphasis on sustainability; and the gradual development of professional procurement practices. It is found that research in the area of supply management in the African context is still scattered, with an evident need for more theoretically rich and methodologically rigorous inquiry. The authors propose a structured, theoretically grounded research agenda for each of the themes identified, and make general observations on potential future directions.","['nanSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT', 'BUSINESS ETHICS', 'SOUTH-AFRICA', 'PURCHASING STRATEGIES', 'FUTURE', 'FIRM', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PROCUREMENT', 'NETWORKS']","['future', 'procurement']",supply management
"This paper examines the interaction effects of institutional differences in the cognitive, normative, and regulatory domains on cross-border acquisition and alliance formation. Using a sample of 673 cross-border acquisitions and alliances conducted by multinational corporations (MNCs) from the manufacturing sector of six emerging economies (EEs) over the period 1995-2008, we find significant mimicking (cognitive domain) of local firms' choice of ownership modes by EE firms. We also find that regulatory distance (regulatory domain) moderates the mimicking of both foreign and local firms while normative distance does not have any moderating effect. These findings contribute to our understanding of how EE MNCs mimic ownership modes in foreign market entry and how the interaction of this mimetic tendency with other institutional pillars affects these decisions.

"Research shows that optimism can positively impact health, but when and why people feel optimistic when confronting health challenges is less clear. Findings from six studies show that the frames people adopt when thinking about health challenges influence their optimism about overcoming those challenges, and that their culture moderates this effect. In cultures where the independent self is highly accessible, individuals adopting an initiator frame (how will I act, regardless of the situations I encounter?) were more optimistic than those adopting a responder frame (how will I react to the situations I encounter?); the converse occurred for individuals from cultures where the interdependent self is highly accessible. Moreover, mediation and moderation evidence revealed that this interactive effect of culture and frame on optimism was driven by people's ability to easily imagine the recovery process. These effects held for distinct health challenges (cancer, diabetes, flood-related illness, traumatic injury) and across single-country and cross-country samples, and they impacted positive health outcomes and decisions ranging from anticipated energy, physical endurance, and willingness to take on more challenging physical therapy to intentions to get vaccinated, stick to a doctor-recommended diet, and undertake a physically strenuous vacation.","['optimism', 'health', 'culture', 'mental simulation', 'framingREGULATORY FIT', 'POSSIBLE SELVES', 'CULTURAL-DIFFERENCES', 'HOLISTIC THINKING', 'BRAND EVALUATION', 'SELF', 'IMAGERY', 'FLUENCY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PERCEPTION']","['optimism', 'health', 'culture', 'self']",impact
"New websites and smartphone applications provide easy-click checking opportunities that can help consumers in many domains. However, this technology is not always used effectively. For example, many consumers skip checking Terms and Conditions links even when a quick evaluation of the terms can save them money, but they check their smartphone while driving even though this behavior is illegal and dangerous. Four laboratory experiments clarify the significance of one contributor to such contradictory deviations from effective checking. Studies 1, 2, and 3 show that, like basic decisions from experience, checking decisions reflect underweighting of rare events, which in turn is a sufficient condition for the coexistence of insufficient and too much checking. Insufficient checking emerges when most checking efforts impair performance even if checking is effective on average. Too much checking emerges when most checking clicks are rewarding even if checking is counterproductive on average. This pattern can be captured with a model that assumes reliance on small samples of past checking decision experiences. Study 4 shows that when the goal is to increase checking, interventions that increase the probability that checking leads to the best possible outcome can be far more effective than efforts to reduce the cost of checking.","['checking decisions', 'clicking decisions', 'decision from experience', 'decision-description gap', 'incentivesCONSUMER CHOICE', 'RISK', 'INFORMATION', 'SEARCH', 'COMPLEXITY', 'CERTAINTY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'STRATEGY', 'READ']","['checking decisions', 'checking decisions', 'behavior']",experience
"Small businesses continue to gi ow in importance to the national economy. According to the Small Business Administration, America's 22 million small businesses generate more than half of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and are the principal source of new jobs. The National Formation for Women Business Owners reported that between 1987 and 1994, the number of women-owned businesses grew by 78% and women-owned firms accounted for 36% of all firms. Although the growth in the number of women-owned businesses is encouraging the size of such businesses,remains small in terms of both revenues and number of employees, especially in comparison to male-owned businesses. One explanation for this disparity is that female business ownership is concentrated primarily in the retail and service industries where businesses are relatively smaller in terms of employment and revenue as opposed to high technology: construction, and manufacturing. One of the most fruitful streams of research in women's occupational choice has been based on social learning theory. Specifically self-efficacy has been found to relate to both type and number of occupations considered by college men and women, and with regard to traditional and non-traditional occupations. Entrepreneurship researchers have also used social learning theory to study entrepreneurial intentions. This study build's on that background of women's career development and entrepreneurial intentions to examine differences between traditional and non-traditional women business owners. We examine 170 women business owners in various traditional and non-traditional businesses in Utah and Illinois. Questionnaires were the primary method of collecting data, in addition to II in-depth interviews from a sample of the survey respondents. Using a careers perspective, based on social learning theory we hypothesized that women iir these two different categories of industries would differ on levels of self-efficacy toward entrepreneurship or venture efficacy their career expectations and their perceived social support. A second analysis was also clone that explored the relationship between the same independent variables and success or performance of the business. The results offer support for using this integrative model to understand differences between women in traditional and non-traditional industries. The first analysis revealed that significant differences exist between the two groups or? several of the independent variables. Traditional business owners had higher venture efficacy for opportunity recognition, higher career expectations of life balance and security and they reported that the financial support received from others was more important to them than those in non-traditional businesses. On the other hand the nontraditional owners had higher venture efficacy for planning and higher career expectations for money or wealth than the traditional group. The second analysis explored whether success, as measured by safes, was affected by differences in venture efficacies, career expectations, or perceived support received by women in traditional businesses as compared to those in non-traditional ones. This analysis revealed that traditional women business owners might have different factors that contribute to their success than non-traditional owners. Specifically, for the traditional owners, venture efficacies for opportunity recognition and economic management as well as the career expectation of autonomy and money (or wealth) were positively related to sales. For rite same group efficacy toward planning and rite need for security were negatively related to sales. For the non-traditional women, venture efficacy toward planning and the career expectation of autonomy Mere positively related to sales while the expectation of money or wealth was negatively related. Also for the same group the perceived importance of the emotional and financial support was negatively related to sales. In the past, most of the entrepreneurial research has used predominantly male samples of entrepreneurs. Those that include women entrepreneurs,generally are comparative, between,men find women. This study's comparison of two groups of women entrepreneurs offers a unique contribution to the field. Future research is recommended to further understand how venture efficacy and career expectations affect the decision to start a new business in a particular industry. it would he particularly beneficial to study venture, efficacy and career expectations of prospective women entrepreneurs prior to the start of the business. Similarly, greater attention should be given to understanding how venture efficacy develops in different individuals.

"There is strong evidence of racial bias in organizations but little understanding of how it changes with repeated interaction. This study proposes that repeated interaction has the potential to reduce racial bias, but its moderating effects may be limited to the treatment of individuals rather than of entire racial groups. Using data from 2,360 National Basketball Association (NBA) players and 163 coaches from 1955 to 2000, I find that players receive more playing time under coaches of the same race, even though there is no difference in their performance. This racial bias is greatly reduced, however, as the player and the coach spend more time on the same team, suggesting that repeated interaction minimizes coaches' biases toward their players. But it does not reduce coaches' racial biases in general. Even after years of coaching other-race players, coaches still exhibit the same levels of racial bias as they did upon first entering the league. These results suggest that repeated workplace interaction is effective in reducing racial bias toward individuals but not toward groups, making an important contribution to the literature on organizational inequality.","['inequality', 'racial bias', 'discrimination', 'intergroup contact', 'contact hypothesis', 'sportsDEEP-LEVEL DIVERSITY', 'STATISTICAL DISCRIMINATION', 'CONTACT HYPOTHESIS', 'NATURAL EXPERIMENT', 'FIELD EXPERIMENT', 'LABOR-MARKET', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EMPLOYMENT', 'WHITE', 'WORK']","['inequality', 'racial bias', 'racial bias', 'performance', 'work']",bias race workplace
There is much debate about the effect of institutional investors on firm innovation.

"Each year, people in the United States donate more than $200 billion to charitable causes. Despite the lack of understanding of whether and how recognition increases charitable behavior, charities often offer it to motivate donor action. This research focuses on how the effectiveness of recognition on charitable behavior is dependent on the joint influence of two distinct dimensions of moral identity: internalization and symbolization. Three studies examining both monetary donations and volunteering behavior show that recognition increases charitable behavior among those characterized by high moral identity symbolization and low moral identity internalization. Notably, those who show high levels of moral identity internalization are uninfluenced by recognition, regardless of their symbolization. By understanding correlates of the two dimensions of moral identity among donors, nonprofits can strategically recognize potential donors to maximize donation and volunteering behavior.","['charitable behavior', 'recognition', 'moral identity', 'symbolization', 'social reinforcementVOLUNTEERISM', 'FRAMEWORK', 'DONATIONS', 'NORM', 'ACTS']","['charitable behavior', 'charitable behavior', 'recognition', 'moral identity', 'moral identity', 'symbolization', 'donations']",recognition behavior
"This article develops and discusses the concept of customer engagement behaviors (CEB), which we define as the customers' behavioral manifestation toward a brand or firm, beyond purchase, resulting from motivational drivers. CEBs include a vast array of behaviors including word-of-mouth (WOM) activity, recommendations, helping other customers, blogging, writing reviews, and even engaging in legal action. The authors develop a conceptual model of the antecedents and consequences-customer, firm, and societal-of CEBs. The authors suggest that firms can manage CEBs by taking a more integrative and comprehensive approach that acknowledges their evolution and impact over time.","['customer engagement', 'customer loyalty', 'cocreation', 'services marketingWORD-OF-MOUTH', 'LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS', 'DYNAMIC-MODEL', 'SATISFACTION', 'BRAND', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'IMPACT', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'MANAGEMENT', 'COMMITMENT']","['customer engagement', 'customer engagement', 'brand', 'antecedents', 'impact', 'consequences']",customer engagement behaviors brand motivational drivers word of mouth model
"Purpose - The objective of this paper is to describe a corporate implementation and application of a sustainable business cycle. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a single case study of a regional producer of dairy products in Sweden. The data were collected from non-structured interviews with managers and available corporate documentation. Findings - The company's sustainable business cycle may be divided into nine stages beginning with the arable land through to the dairy and transportation of products to market, where the final two stages involve external retailers and consumers, all of which is important to fulfilment of the earlier seven internal stages. Research limitations/implications - The findings stress the importance of connecting and reconnecting not just to immediate environmental concerns of business, but also to planet Earth, which is under non-sustainable pressure and evidently faces an unpleasant destiny. Practical implications - The case highlights advantages and challenges facing a small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) tasked with implementing a sustainable business cycle for a commodity product in a highly competitive market, dominated by powerful retailers. Social implications - Changing consumer behaviours and purchasing patterns, as well as state interventions imposed at top political levels worldwide, will gradually increase the necessity to create sustainable business cycles. Originality/value - The main contribution of this article is to present a rare detailed case study of a sustainable, organic milk supply chain. It highlights the areas where sustainability is effective. It also illustrates the challenge for an SME trying to extend the reach and to create awareness of added value to the consumer. Hopefully some lessons will be learned and emphasized in this case study.","['Sustainability', 'Supply chain', 'Sustainable development', 'Supply chain management', 'Business cycles', 'Dairy products', 'SwedenETHICS']","['sustainability', 'supply chain', 'supply chain', 'business cycles', 'business cycles', 'dairy products', 'dairy products']",business cycle dairy sweden transportation
"This study posits that a local process of creative destruction provides an impetus to regional industrial renewal. We argue that exits of older firms release resources that stimulate local entry. New entrants add value to these resources by redeploying them in more productive uses. We test our hypotheses with a unique longitudinal database encompassing the entry and exit of Canadian manufacturing enterprises. We find that exits of old firms increase entry and that on average new entrants are more productive. Persistent high local rates of exit, however, deter entry.

"The visual preference heuristic suggests that consumers prefer visual to verbal depiction of information in a product assortment. Images produce greater perceptions of variety than text, which is appealing in assortment selection, but can result in choice complexity and overload when choice sets are large and preferences are unknown, suggesting a moderator for Iyengar and Lepper's results. Eye-tracking results reveal that the natural gestalt processing of individual visual stimuli, as compared to the piecemeal processing of individual textual stimuli, affects the processing of the assortment as a whole with visual (compared to verbal) presentation facilitating a faster, though more haphazard, scanning of the assortment. While the less systematic processing that results from visual presentation feels easier, it is not ideal for larger assortments resulting in higher complexity ratings and choice overload than with text depiction. These findings reveal that, like many heuristics, preference for visual depiction may be overapplied.","['nanINDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'CONSUMERS', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'ORGANIZATION', 'CONSISTENCY', 'ACTIVATION', 'EXPERIENCE', 'PICTURES', 'SEARCH', 'IMPACT']","['consumers', 'perceptions']",information images text
"Numerous studies have investigated the impact of review volume and review variance on product price, but their findings are mixed. The perspective of mismatch cost framework (e.g., Sun 2012) argues that, at the market level, the impact of review variance on product price varies with review valence due to diverse product tastes across individuals. The perspective of classic expected utility framework (e.g., Wu and Ayala Gaytan 2013; Wu et al. 2013) further argues that heterogeneous risk attitudes across individuals directly drives the varying impact of both review volume and variance on willingness-to-pay, regardless of review valence. Although both frameworks have gained good empirical support, neither of them probed whether the impact of review volume or review variance varies within an individual. We extend the current research by focusing on the varying impact of review volume on consumers' willingness-to-pay. Combining economic and behavioral theories of decisions under uncertainty, we argue that consumers' preferences of uncertainty can vary both across and within individuals. The extended framework thus concludes that the impact of review volume on consumers' willingness-to-pay not only varies across individuals with different types of uncertainty preferences, but may also change with review valence within an individual of some types of uncertainty preferences. The framework is tested using an experimental study and an empirical study. Results from both studies provide good support for this broader framework.

"This article examines differences in performance between private companies (POEs) and state owned enterprises (SOEs), with an emphasis on the effects of market structure. The study uses a comprehensive panel covering in principle all registered companies during the 1990s in Norway, a country where SOEs play an important role in regular markets. Return on assets as well as costs relative to sales revenue are used as measures of performance in markets where SOEs and POEs compete with each other. Overall, POEs perform significantly better than SOEs. The study tests the hypothesis that SOE managers may learn from POE managers in environments with stronger competition, but finds only weak empirical support for such a learning mechanism.","['nanCORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'AGENCY COSTS', 'PRIVATIZATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'COMPETITION', 'STRATEGY', 'FIRMS', 'PRIVATISATION', 'INCENTIVES', 'TRANSITION']",['competition'],market competition
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address the management of supply chains within the construction industry. Supply chains in this sector evidence a marked tendency to waste and inefficiency. One approach to improving this situation, which is the subject of intense discussion by both scientists and practitioners, is the establishment of strategic partnerships integrated with the scientific observation of the processes involved. This paper aims to present a case study of such a strategic alliance among German building contractors whose goal it is to cover the entire life cycle of a building, from its planning to its ultimate facility management. The paper seeks to focus on the establishment and implementation of an aggregated strategic alliance and its success factors. Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology is based on a case study of a German network of builders and trade contracting companies. Data collection tools included observation of workshops and meetings, semi-structured interviews and access to key documentation, IT-infrastructure and archives of the network. Findings - Key factors of success in strategic alliances within the construction industry are: central coordination among the partners employing decentralised task management; application of an appropriate IT-solution; and mutual trust among the cooperating partners. Originality/value of paper - While there is growing literature in the field of supply chain management within the construction industry there is less empirical evidence providing practical examples of managing supply chains in this area. Strategic alliances are a crucial requisite for the successful management and integration of services and production within the construction industry.","['Construction industry', 'Supply chain management', 'Strategic alliances', 'Communication technologies', 'Partnershipnan']","['construction industry', 'construction industry', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'strategic alliances', 'strategic alliances']",construction industry supply chain management
"Purpose - Business renovation, the effective utilisation of information technology and the role of business process modelling and simulation, are all vital in supply chain integration projects. This paper aims to show through a combination of these methods how the performance of the supply chain can be improved with the renovation and integration of processes at various tiers in the chain and by the sharing of information between companies. Design/methodology/approach - Simulation-based methodology for measuring the benefits of the creation and renovation of business process models combines the methodology of developing process models and its simulation with the simulation of supply and demand. A procurement process in the oil/retail petrol industry is examined in a case study. Findings - Using the proposed methodology, different business process models can be investigated and simulated. The benefits for each company involved in the presented case are substantial and can be estimated through a simulation. Substantial benefits in costs, quality and lead times were identified, however, their distribution is not symmetric. Inter-organisational IS and applied technology were enablers for supply chain integration. However, organisational changes and new business models were prerequisites for obtaining those benefits. Practical implications - The process approach to supply chain integration presents a mechanism that can be applied to any industry. It represents a systematic methodological business renovation approach involving cost cuts, quality improvements and lead-time improvements. The costs of supply chain integration projects were not studied. The benefits should be measured against the cost of testing the economic feasibility of such projects. Originality/value - The effective utilisation of business process modelling and a simulation of the necessary business renovation are shown. The novel combination of business process and demand/supply simulation enables an estimation of changes in lead-times, process execution costs, quality of the process and inventory costs. Although the methodology is presented through a case study of the oil/retail petrol industry, it can also be used to estimate the benefits and monitor supply chain integration projects in other industries.","['supply chain management', 'business process re-engineering', 'business simulations', 'modelling', 'procurementE-BUSINESS', 'SIMULATION', 'INFORMATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'DYNAMICS', 'STRATEGY']","['modelling', 'simulation', 'information']",renovation integration performance
"Research summary: Using a productivity technique (VCA model), we estimate the economic value created by a firm and appropriated by its stakeholders in two specific empirical contexts. In the first application, we use publicly available data from the U.S. airline industry to illustrate how the VCA model can be used with multiple stakeholder groups. In the second application, we provide estimates for three global automobile companies (GM, Toyota and Nissan), showing how the model can be reformulated using value added. In both industries we find substantial heterogeneity among firms in the creation and distribution of value. We discuss strengths and limitations of the VCA model and implications for strategic management research.Managerial summary: Firms create value not only for shareholders, but also for other stakeholders, including employees, customers and suppliers. This article applies a method to quantify the new economic value created by a firm over an interval of time; the method also reveals the distribution of that value among the stakeholders. The proposed method gives managers some means to assess changes in the economic value created and distributed. We find that the creation and distribution of value has varied greatly among major U.S. airlines and global automakers in recent decades. Moreover, returns to shareholders typically accounted for only a small proportion of firms' total value creation and often had little relation to broader changes in the magnitude and distribution of value.

"Although knowledge assets provide multinational corporations (MNCs) with competitive advantages in foreign markets, it can be difficult for firms to protect their knowledge in foreign countries - especially countries with weak intellectual property (IP) protection. Building on and extending the knowledge management, institutional theory and expatriate literatures, this article explores whether home country expatriates can substitute for weak IP protection and drive an increase in more and more valuable knowledge transfers to foreign operations located in weak IP protection countries. Because of their ties to headquarters, knowledge of parent firm assets, priorities and routines, and activities in local operations, I argue that home country expatriates can transform the local operation to offer higher protection for parent firm knowledge in weak IP countries in ways that local managers cannot. The results from a comprehensive panel of US multinationals suggest that home country expatriates can substitute for weak IP protection, but that this effect is contingent on the manufacturing and knowledge capabilities of foreign operations for higher value parent firm knowledge transfers. Overall, this article extends our understanding of the global management and protection of knowledge by MNCs by exploring how organizational practices can buffer country-level institutional deficiencies for firm knowledge.","['knowledge transfer', 'multinational corporations (MNCs) and enterprises (MNEs)', 'intellectual property protection', 'innovation', 'patents', 'knowledge valueRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'PROPERTY-RIGHTS', 'UNITED-STATES', 'JAPANESE MULTINATIONALS', 'SUBSIDIARY PERFORMANCE', 'TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER', 'FIRM']","['knowledge transfer', 'knowledge transfer', 'multinational corporations', 'multinational corporations', 'firm']",knowledge assets corporations firms intellectual property
"Almost no academic papers treat a crucial aspect of alliances - the determinants of the division of alliance value over the partners. Analyzing a sample of cross-border alliances, technology providing partners increase their share of total alliance returns when accepting riskier forms of compensation. Returns to a partner, and the risk they assume, are shown to be correlated through minimum sales or minimum royalty agreement clauses. Firms with stronger technical capabilities gain more from technology alliances. The bargaining power wielded by each party, while negotiating the structure of an alliance, influences each partner's share of overall alliance benefits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"Although cross-channel retailing has become a game changer for retailers, few previous studies have looked at the problems from the inherently holistic perspective of a business model approach. Using a single case study but multiple data collection methods, including interviews, observations, and document analysis, on the biggest Chinese retailer in consumer electronic appliances, the present study examines how different aspects of the business model changed after the retailer launched its cross-channel strategy. The results identify the major changes on three fronts: redefinition of target clients, a new proposition for shopping value, and redesign of the value chain. Findings suggest that a retailer shifting toward the cross-channel strategy will follow the stage-of-adoption model, which may be in five stages, and that the physical store as a hub linking different channels will become the source of value creation. To facilitate the strategic shift, retailers should optimize rather than merge their activities across channels, reinforce the strengths of the physical store, develop co-creation value with stakeholders, and revamp their organization.","['Business model', 'Chinese retail', 'cross-channel retailing', 'e-tail', 'online retailELECTRONIC COMMERCE', 'MULTICHANNEL', 'MATURITY', 'INTERNET', 'CREATION', 'MORTAR', 'CLICKS']","['business model', 'business model', 'chinese retail', 'chinese retail', 'cross channel retailing', 'cross channel retailing', 'cross channel retailing', 'creation']",cross channel retailing business model co creation
"Research Summary: We advance the concept of organization-stakeholder fit (O-S fit) to explain cooperative behavior between an organization and its stakeholders. O-S fit describes the compatibility that exists between an organization and a stakeholder when their characteristics are well matched. We highlight two dimensions of O-S fit: value congruence, or the supplementary fit of organizational and stakeholder values, and strategic complementarity, or the complementary fit of strategic needs and resources. For each dimension, we detail the unique relational factors-including core elements of trust, predictability, attraction/exchange, and communication-that motivate cooperation. We then explicate the ways in which value congruence and strategic complementarity dynamically interrelate over time. Finally, we consider how organization-stakeholder misfit may result in alternative relational behaviors, such as conflict or compromise. Managerial Summary: We develop a new way of thinking about the relationship between organizations and stakeholders. Recognizing that positive relationships require a degree of fit or compatibility, we argue that cooperative behavior between an organization and its stakeholders is maximized when relational partners share both core values and strategic priorities. We explain that high fit along these two dimensions increases trust, relational predictability, attraction/exchange, and communication. We also describe how positive relationships might be formed with fit along only one dimension, and how negative relationships might result in the presence of misfit. Ultimately, we suggest that managers who want to foster positive relationships with stakeholders should concentrate on aligning their values and priorities, rather than simply concentrating on one or the other.","['cooperative strategy', 'fit', 'interorganizational relationships', 'reciprocity', 'stakeholder managementPERSON-ENVIRONMENT FIT', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS', 'PARTNER SELECTION', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'VALUE CREATION', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'SELF-DETERMINATION', 'VALUE CONGRUENCE', 'TRUST', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['fit', 'value congruence', 'value congruence', 'trust']",strategic complementarity trust
"When confronted with racial stigma, how do people manage it? What specific arrangements of objects and tactics do they mobilize to make everyday life more tolerable (if not more equal)? The politics of respectability (respectability) is one such arrangement. Respectability makes life more tolerable by offering a counternarrative that disavows stigma through status-oriented displays. This strategy of action emerged alongside mass consumer culture in the late 19th century, but what relevance does it have to those who are stigmatized in contemporary consumer culture? Based on ethnographic interviews and observations with middle-class African Americans, respectability remains an important strategy that has undergone profound changes since its origins while still operating in similar ways. In the late 20th century it fractured into two related but distinct counternarratives: (1) discern and avoid, which seeks distance from whatever is stigmatized, and (2) destigmatize, using black culture as a source of high status. Perceptions of how well either counternarrative manages stigma depend on how ideology, strategy, and consumption are connected via specific sociohistorical features of place and individual power resources. I illustrate those connections through four cases that show perceived success and perceived failure for each counternarrative.","['stigma', 'consumer resistance', 'racismCONSUMER ACCULTURATION', 'SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION', 'INTERSECTIONALITY', 'CULTURE', 'CHOICE', 'RACISM', 'AMERICANS', 'MEANINGS', 'ACTIVISM', 'HISTORY']","['stigma', 'culture', 'americans']",stigma ideology
"Research Summary: We apply real options (RO) theory to understand the role of corporate venture capital (CVC) investments and its relationship with internal R&D capabilities in supporting the acquisition of external technologies. We formulate hypotheses about key drivers of the option value of CVC and the decision to exercise the RO using a dyadic dataset of global pharmaceutical firms and their biotech partners. Our findings suggest that the option value of CVC is higher for investors with weaker scientific capabilities; engaging the markets for technology in distant technological fields; and, when their innovation pipeline is tilted toward the late-stage development process. Finally, the licensing of high-value technologies is the most likely form of option exercise when technological uncertainty is reduced post-CVC. Managerial Summary: Despite the fact that one of the main goals of corporate venture capital (CVC) investments in high-tech industries is to gain a window on future technologies, the relationship between CVC and other strategies used to acquire external technologies, such as licensing, has not been adequately explored. To address this gap, we formulate hypotheses about key drivers of the decision to make CVC investments as a wait-and-see strategy in the markets for technology (MFT) using a longitudinal dataset of global pharmaceutical firms and their biotech partners. We find that investors' scientific capabilities, technological domains, and research pipelines impact investors' decisions to make CVC investments prior to other MFT transactions. In our research setting, investors typically acquire high-value technologies via licensing when technological uncertainty is reduced post-CVC.","['absorptive capacity', 'corporate venture capital', 'markets for technology', 'product pipeline', 'real optionsRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'EXTERNAL LINKAGES', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'INNOVATION', 'FIRMS', 'ACQUISITIONS', 'GOVERNANCE', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['corporate venture capital', 'corporate venture capital', 'corporate venture capital', 'markets for technology', 'markets for technology', 'markets for technology', 'uncertainty', 'innovation', 'firms']",real options venture markets innovation markets for technology

"It has been widely recognized that marketing's interaction with other functional departments (e.g., R&D) has significant impact on new product success. However, little research addresses how marketing actually behaves in the process of new product development (NPD). Drawing upon marketing, product innovation, and organizational buying literatures, this study contributes to the literature by delineating the types of influence tactics adopted by marketing and investigating how the use of these tactics affects marketing's influence on. NPD decisions. Data on 128 new product projects from 114 high technology firms in China were collected from R&D perspective via on-site interviews. The findings indicate that, from the R&D's perspective, both marketing and R&D seem to have equivalent influence on new product decisions. In terms of usage frequency, the most frequently used influence tactics by marketing are persistent pressure, information exchange, and recommendation (i.e., use of rational logic). Coalition formation (e.g., seeking the support of peers) and upward appeal (i.e., seeking support from superiors) tactics are moderately used. The less frequently used tactics are legalistic plea (i.e., use of rules and regulations) and request. Regarding the effectiveness of influence tactics, the results indicate that persistent pressure, information exchange, and coalition formation lead to higher marketing influence in NPD decisions. However, the use of an upward appeal tactic leads to lower marketing influence. Recommendation, legalistic plea and request tactics are unrelated to marketing's influence. Our results also show that the efficacy of marketing's influence tactics is contingent upon the degree of functional interdependence in the NPD stages and the degree of interdepartmental conflict. Information exchange and coalition formation tactics are more effective at the initiation stage of the NPD process whereas legalistic plea and persistent pressure are more effective at the implementation stage. We further find that legalistic plea is more effective but coalition tactic is less effective when the degree of interdepartmental conflict is higher Findings of this study provide managers responsible for ensuring market-oriented NPD with a better understanding of how the influence of marketing in the NPD process may be enhanced. Given our focus on Chinese firms, they also suggest that managers need to be sensitive to the cultural context of marketing influence.

"In this paper, we develop a theory to explain why the implementation of new technologies often disrupts occupational roles in ways that delay the expected benefits. To explore these disruptions, we construct a dynamic model grounded in ethnographic data from Barley's widely cited (1986) study of computed tomography (CT) as implemented in two hospitals. Using modeling, we formalize the recursive relationship between the activity of CT scanning and the types and accumulations of knowledge used by doctors and technologists. We find that a balance of expertise across occupational boundaries in operating the technology creates a pattern in which the benefits of the new technology are likely to be realized most rapidly. By operationalizing the dynamics between knowledge and social action, we specify more clearly the recursive relationship between structuring and structure.","['nanCONSEQUENCES', 'INFORMATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'WORK']",['knowledge'],tomography
"Although check-in behavior has developed rapidly in recent years, the reasons why people share location-related information and the activities they are engaged in have not been adequately investigated. The primary objective of this study is to develop and refine a conceptual framework from social word-of-mouth motivations and the mobile perspective to provide a theoretical understanding of the motivations that induce consumers to engage in check-in behavior. The results show that the social condition (e.g., tie strength, subjective norms, expressiveness, social support, and information sharing) play the most critical role in motivating people to engage in check-in behavior. In addition, the perceptual (e.g., perceived social benefit, perceived enjoyment, and perceived value) and consumption-based conditions (such as customer satisfaction and communicator involvement) also motivate people to engage in check-in behavior and to disseminate their consumption experiences by using mobile devices. The results provide certain theoretical and practical implications for marketing practitioners in their planning of new marketing strategies to attract consumer attention, and will contribute to a better understanding of check-in behavior.","['Electronic word of mouth', 'eWoM', 'm-commerce', 'mobile commerce', 'motivation', 'online check-in', 'online disclosure', 'social sharingWORD-OF-MOUTH', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'UNOBSERVABLE VARIABLES', 'I SHARE', 'INFORMATION', 'SERVICES', 'MOTIVATIONS', 'EWOM', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'COMMITMENT']","['motivation', 'information', 'motivations']",check in word of mouth customer satisfaction
"In this study, we test the effects of retrenchment aggressiveness on turnaround performance. Using the downward-spiral, threat-rigidity, and survivor syndrome perspectives, we hypothesize the direct effects of the two dimensions of aggressiveness-time aggressiveness and volume aggressiveness-on turnaround performance. We also examine the moderation effect of time aggressiveness on the relationship between volume aggressiveness and turnaround performance. We use data on a sample of declining firms collected from the Compustat North America database and use a matched-pair sample of 494 surviving and nonsurviving firms between the years 1990 and 2010. Our results show that time aggressiveness has a positive effect on turnaround performance, whereas volume aggressiveness has a negative effect. We also find that time aggressiveness positively moderates the negative relationship between volume aggressiveness and turnaround performance. We contribute to the scant but critical literature indicating the importance of time in a turnaround setting and to the long-held discussion of retrenchment as a cause of turnaround or a consequence of decline.","['turnaround', 'retrenchment aggressiveness', 'time', 'timing', 'speed', 'downward-spiral perspective', 'threat-rigidity perspective', 'survivor syndrome perspectiveORGANIZATIONAL DECLINE', 'TURNAROUND STRATEGIES', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'BOARD COMPOSITION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LAYOFFS', 'BANKRUPTCY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'SURVIVORS', 'CONSEQUENCES']","['turnaround', 'retrenchment aggressiveness', 'retrenchment aggressiveness', 'time', 'performance']",retrenchment aggressiveness turnaround performance downward spiral threat rigidity syndrome time aggressiveness volume

"Despite documented benefits, the processes described in the new product development literature often prove difficult to follow in practice. A principal source of such difficulties is the phenomenon of fire fighting-the unplanned allocation of resources to fix problems discovered late in a product's development cycle. While it has been widely criticized, fire fighting is a common occurrence in many product development organizations. To understand both its existence and persistence, in this article I develop a formal model of fire fighting in a multiproject development environment. The major contributions of this analysis are to suggest that: (1) fire fighting can be a self-reinforcing phenomenon. and (2) multiproject development systems are far more susceptible to this dynamic than is currently appreciated. These insights suggest that many of the current methods for aggregate resource and product portfolio planning, while necessary, are not sufficient to prevent fire fighting and the consequent low performance.

"Many firms now realize the importance of planning product families and product platforms. However, little research addresses planning and execution of different types of projects within a product family platform series. This study investigates project characteristics, development challenges, typical outcomes, and success factors for product development projects at different locations in the product family spectrum. Platform projects result in products that initiate a new product family platform for a company. Derivative projects result in products consisting of extensions to an existing product family platform. Data on 108 new product development projects from a variety of assembled products industries were collected via a detailed survey and analyzed. Findings indicate that: (I) platform and derivative projects differ in project task characteristics (including the amount of new technology development undertaken and project complexity) and market newness; (2) platform and derivative projects generally do not differ in terms of project success (achievement of project objectives, level of company satisfaction, and perceived customer satisfaction) or smoothness of project execution; (3) both platform and derivative projects generally are executed in similar ways; (4) certain managerial approaches (including contingency planning, project-based evaluation of personnel, and overlap of design and manufacturing engineering) are associated with higher project execution success for both platform and derivative projects; and (5) use of interdependent technologies and novel project objectives are associated with project execution failure for platform projects. The results suggest that firms can continue to employ a single product development management process for both platform and derivative projects, as long as modest customization of the process is made for the given project type. Completely different management processes are not required. In all, the results presented in this article suggest specific managerial actions companies can take to significantly improve product development success.

"This study suggests that the link between an SBU strategy and performance is moderated by the SBU's relationship with corporate management. Information processing arguments suggest that this relationship, typically characterized by general measures of centralization, has been inappropriately conceptualized in prior research. An alternative view, one that considers which decisions and activities should be controlled by the individual SBU, is proposed and tested. The results of a study of 496 SBUs indicate that SBU performance is enhanced when: (1) SBUs with an external strategic orientation control environmental monitoring activities and strategic decision analysis, and (2) SBUs with an intraorganizational orientation control those activities relating to operations. Weaker SBU performance is associated with SBU control over those functions and activities not central to the SBU's business strategy. Therefore, it is suggested that the corporate-SBU relationship can either facilitate or inhibit the implementation of the SBU's intended strategy.","['BUSINESS STRATEGY', 'CORPORATE-SBU RELATIONSHIP', 'STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATIONDIVERSIFICATION', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'MILES', 'FIRMS']","['business strategy', 'business strategy', 'corporate sbu relationship', 'corporate sbu relationship', 'corporate sbu relationship', 'implementation']",strategy
"Research on strategic momentum considers how experience with innovation affects firms' subsequent innovativeness. Traditionally the momentum literature has emphasized arguments for an accelerating effect of innovation experience, but recent critiques and contrasting empirical results suggest ambiguity regarding how experience with innovation affects subsequent innovative activity. In this study, we develop arguments for a more expanded view of strategic momentum, examining momentum in the form of temporal consistency of ongoing innovation. This expanded view argues that organizations have incentives for steady-state patterns of innovation in the form of temporal consistency of ongoing innovation. To explore this expanded view of momentum, we examine how experience with innovation facilitates these temporally consistent patterns of innovation, as well as how increasing organizational age may inhibit such consistency. Analyses of generational product innovation in business productivity software highlight the importance of temporal consistency for innovativeness and momentum.","['strategic momentum', 'innovation', 'temporal consistency', 'routines', 'capabilities', 'experienceORGANIZATIONAL ROUTINES', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION', 'INCREMENTAL INNOVATIONS', 'MANAGEMENT-RESEARCH', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CAPABILITIES', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'INERTIA', 'MODEL']","['strategic momentum', 'strategic momentum', 'innovation', 'temporal consistency', 'temporal consistency']",strategic momentum experience with innovation innovativeness incentives
"The increase in the variety of channel formats, and the progression from single, to multi-, then to omni-channel marketing has made shopping and buying more convenient for consumers, but trickier to manage for marketers both upstream suppliers and downstream retailers. The first step in managing multi- and omni-channel distribution is to find the specific metrics that will facilitate reliable analysis of the relationship between distribution and marketing objectives. That is our primary goal in this article to present the metrics, both old and new, that marketers, both suppliers and retailers, need to monitor, and that academic researchers, both theoretical and empirical, should incorporate in their models. We present a basic framework for managing distribution, and summarize the metrics that are relevant to each element of the framework. Then, we lay out what we believe are important questions that multi- and omni-channel marketers are grappling with, refer the reader to what existing academic research has to say about them, and suggest how future research can build off our framework and metrics to supplement what is known and address what is not.

"A limited number of studies have identified multilevel determinants of chief executive officer (CEO) commitment to the status quo (CSQ). Using an unintrusive measure of CEO CSQ developed through computer-aided content analyses of CEO letters to shareholders, this study confirmed that determinants of CEO CSQ are multilevel, including factors at the individual (CEO age and tenure), organizational (size and financial slack), and industry (extent of industry discretion) levels of analysis. In addition, as an important extension to prior research, the authors find that CEO CSQ is associated with future performance changes depending on a firm's industry environment. They find that in high-discretion industries, firms whose CEOs are committed to the status quo suffer future financial and market performance declines as compared with their competitors, whereas such performance deterioration does not occur in low-discretion environments. Indeed, when future performance is market based and measured as Tobin's Q, the authors find that compared with competitors, a firm's performance actually improves in low-discretion industries if its CEO is committed to the status quo.","['CEOs', 'executive beliefs', 'change', 'content analysisSTRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING', 'TOP EXECUTIVE COMMITMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'COMPANY PERFORMANCE', 'DECLINING FIRMS', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'RISK-TAKING', 'EFFECT SIZE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'TENURE']","['ceos', 'change', 'tenure']",commitment

Moreover, it remains an open question why strategic intentions at the outset of an investment project differ from the actual operations established. We address these questions by extending the model and combining it with Mintzberg and Waters' framework of strategy formation. Specifically, we suggest that commitment decisions correspond to statements of intended strategy, while network positions correspond to realized strategies. The processes of learning, opportunity creation and trust building triggered by commitment decisions are, however, moderated by institutional influences that lead to divergences between realized and intended strategies. We test propositions derived from this framework on a survey data set of subsidiaries of multinational enterprises in Hungary, Lithuania and Poland, and find that institutional voids and institutional uncertainty affect subsidiary strategy implementation, but in opposing directions. Under high institutional uncertainty, investors prefer low commitment but flexible modes that enable later commitment increases, whereas institutional voids increase up-front information search and adaptation costs that reduce the likelihood of early post-entry adjustments. Our analysis reinforces the need for more differentiated theoretical analyses of how institutions affect business strategies over time.

"Research has not verified the theoretical or practical value of the brand attachment construct in relation to alternative constructs, particularly brand attitude strength. The authors make conceptual, measurement, and managerial contributions to this research issue. Conceptually, they define brand attachment, articulate its defining properties, and differentiate it from brand attitude strength. From a measurement perspective, they develop and validate a parsimonious measure of brand attachment, test the assumptions that underlie it, and demonstrate that it indicates the concept of attachment. They also demonstrate the convergent and discriminant validity of this measure in relation to brand attitude strength. Managerially, they demonstrate that brand attachment offers value over brand attitude strength in predicting (1) consumers' intentions to perform difficult behaviors (those they regard as using consumer resources), (2) actual purchase behaviors, (3) brand purchase share (the share of a brand among directly competing brands), and (4) need share (the extent to which consumers rely on a brand to address relevant needs, including those brands in substitutable product categories).","['brand management', 'consumer behavior', 'marketing strategy', 'brand attachment', 'attitude strengthWORKING MODELS', 'SELF-ESTEEM', 'CONSUMERS', 'CONNECTIONS']","['brand attachment', 'brand attachment', 'consumers']",attitude strength
"Upper echelon theory highlights the importance of top management teams in large and established firms; however, effects are not always clear outside of this context. Due to the unique nature of new ventures, the composition of entrepreneurial teams and its effects on performance is worthy of investigation. Accordingly, we meta-analyze the effect of three characteristics of entrepreneurial team composition (i.e., aggregated, heterogeneity, team size) on new venture performance. Our meta-analysis, which includes 55 empirical samples and 8,892 observations, finds significant and unique effects of entrepreneurial team characteristics on new ventures.

"Research SummaryUsing detailed ownership and financial information from a large sample of owner-managed private firms in three Western European countries, this paper examines the relationship between CEO's age and firm's performance. Tracking firms over time, we find that as a CEO ages, the firm experiences lower investment, lower sales growth, and lower profitability, but also higher probability of survival, suggesting a trade-off between the managerial approaches of younger and older CEOs. These results are stronger in industries more reliant on human capital, such as service and creative industries. Our evidence also suggests that regional financial development moderates the relationship between a CEO's age and a firm's performance by facilitating the reallocation of assets from firms owned by older CEOs to firms owned by younger CEOs. Managerial SummaryHow do management styles change as CEOs grow older? Using a large firm-level dataset, we examine the behavior and performance of firms with CEOs of different ages. We find that as a CEO grows older, firm investment, growth, and profitability decline, but probability of survival increases. The results are stronger in industries where human capital and creativity are more important. Regional financial development moderates the age-performance relationship by facilitating reallocation of assets from firms with old CEOs to firms with younger CEOs. Our findings suggest that management styles change with age, as older CEOs tend to emphasize survival at the expense of higher profits and faster growth.","[""CEO's age"", 'closely held firms', 'financial development', 'firm growthMODERATING ROLE', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'MANAGERIAL', 'RESOURCES', 'TENURE', 'LIFE', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'ORGANIZATION', 'PERSISTENCE', 'ADULTHOOD']","['ceo s age', 'ceo s age', 'ceo s age', 'financial development', 'financial development', 'managerial']",ownership human capital financial development management creativity
"This paper extends organizational imprinting theory to networks by examining how the social technology available during the establishment of community-based intercorporate networks continues to influence contemporary network structures despite major changes in the U.S. corporate environment. I examine the 51 largest U.S. community network systems in 1986, the same networks in 2000, and the network activity of the component organizations of those network systems. Results show that even when controlling for many plausible alternative explanations, communities established prior to the advent of air travel technology have preserved locally focused networks, which suggests that this pattern is maintained by emulation of locally legitimate templates of action. This research contributes to work on imprinting by extending it to networks and in theorizing the social mechanisms that result in the persistence of social forms. Furthermore, it contributes to work on directorship networks by suggesting that the way information flows through this network may be geographically contingent.","['nanINTERLOCKING DIRECTORATES', 'SOCIAL-CLASS', 'IRON CAGE', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'MARKET', 'GOVERNANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'BUSINESS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'HISTORY']",['organizations'],imprinting technology work directorship
"Native advertising and storytelling are both increasingly popular advertising strategies. This research explores the effectiveness of storytelling in a native advertising context on social media. While most research recommends the use of stories as a way to build trust and relationships with consumers, the current research suggests that in the form of native ads on social media, narratives may be less effective when compared to informational native ads. Two studies find that even when advertising cues such as disclosure labels and brand presence are prominently located, consumers are less likely to recognize the advertising nature of narrative native ads when compared to informational native ads. Lower levels of advertising recognition are associated with increased perceptions of manipulative intentions by the advertiser, which has a negative influence on consumers' attitudes toward the ad. The findings suggest that native ads that clearly communicate their advertising nature through cues such as an informational execution, high brand presence. and prominent disclosure labeling are more effective than a narrative execution style.

"In line with increased attention on the application of cognitive approaches to industrial, work and organizational psychology, the last 40 years have witnessed a growing interest in application of the cognitive style construct to the field of business and management. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, we wish to advance understanding of cognitive styles research by elucidating trends and perspectives related to business and management. Second, we identify gaps in the literature and promising areas of research that can be further developed. This is accomplished by means of a review of papers published between 1969 and 2009. Eight themes emerged from our analysis: (a) vocational and occupational issues; (b) national culture; (c) teamwork and interpersonal relationships; (d) learning; (e) decision making; (f) creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship; (g) sales and marketing; and (h) management information systems, information management and use. Third, we identify valid and reliable methods of assessment of cognitive style for use in business and management settings.

"Buyers in retail chains typically plan promotional markdowns and accompanying advertising for the complete season, subject to budgetary and scheduling constraints. Because of the large number of possible alternatives and the difficulty of predicting the sales responses to novel plans, promotional plans are currently prepared through trial and error, by modifying previous years' plans. This paper proposes a methodology for developing an optimal promotional plan that maximizes total season profit, subject to promotional resource constraints and a set of possible market scenarios, by selecting from a discrete set of candidate ads and markdowns. The benefit of the optimization model is illustrated by applying it to promotional data from a major department store chain and comparing the results to plans previously implemented by the buyers.","['nanSALES', 'PROMOTION', 'DEMAND']",['promotion'],model
"This study examines international corporate entrepreneurship associated with new product lines and new geographic markets. Drawing upon agency theory and the corporate entrepreneurship literature, we posit that aligning CEO incentives with shareholder interests and adopting CEO monitoring mechanisms will promote international corporate entrepreneurship. We test the hypotheses using 277 U.S.-based manufacturing firms during the period from 2003 to 2009. Our findings highlight how various governance mechanisms such as a CEO's compensation linked to the long-term performance of the firm, the values of the CEO's shareholding, independent board leadership, and the representation of outside directors influence international corporate entrepreneurship of existing firms.

Using a cross-industry sample of manufacturing SMEs, we validate and map four distinct innovation strategies onto specific sets of product innovation capabilities. Results show that human capital development efforts catalyze both the external absorption and the internal emergence of novel capabilities. Stronger emphasis on product features and broader market access stimulate the effective replication of extant capabilities, yielding immediate payoffs.

"The interdependence of regional trade and production networks has important implications for national prosperity, regional stability and the internationalization of production. We ask: What are the locational patterns of trade in value-added in East Asia and how are these patterns changing over time? The disintermediation of value chains and the externalization of business activity create hubs of capability and extend value chains between countries. We adopt input-output techniques to analyze the evolution of production networks in East Asia over the period 1990-2005 from a value chain perspective. A high density of cross-border interaction is reported alongside changing geographic dynamics, and an informal integration derived from intermediates trade in value-addition.

"This paper explores the link between subsidiary performance feedback and internal governance mechanisms in multiunit firms. A central premise of performance-feedback models is that performance below aspirations is associated with increased risk tolerance and thereby with a higher likelihood of taking excessive risks in resource allocation decisions. Building on this observation, we contend that the headquarters of multiunit firms take this association into account in the design of internal (i.e., headquarters-subsidiary) governance mechanisms. Accordingly, a subsidiary's performance-aspiration gap (below aspirations) is positively associated with the headquarters' oversight of its resource allocation decisions and negatively associated with the provision of incentive schemes that promote risk taking. Regression results, using data on subsidiaries in France between 1998 and 2004, support our hypotheses and show that subsidiaries performing below historical and social aspirations are less likely to be given discretion in investment decisions and incentivized by cash bonuses. In the supplementary analyses, we also provide suggestive evidence that subsidiary performance problems in multiunit firms trigger structural adaptation in the internal governance mechanisms in pursuit of regaining fit.","['autonomy', 'governance', 'incentives', 'organization design', 'performance feedback', 'resource allocation', 'structural adaptationRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'BEHAVIORAL AGENCY MODEL', 'RISK-TAKING', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'MANAGERIAL INCENTIVES', 'CAPITAL-MARKETS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL ASPIRATIONS', 'EMPIRICAL EXPLORATION', 'STRATEGIC PERSISTENCE', 'REFERENCE POINTS']","['governance', 'performance feedback', 'performance feedback', 'resource allocation', 'resource allocation', 'risk taking', 'risk taking']",performance feedback models

"Typically, shoppers' paths only cover less than half of the areas in a grocery store. Given that shoppers often use physical products in the store as external memory cues, encouraging shoppers to travel more of the store may increase unplanned spending. Estimating the direct effect of in-store travel distance on unplanned spending, however, is complicated by the difficulty of collecting in-store path data and the endogeneity of in-store travel distance. To address both issues, the authors collect a novel data set using in-store radio frequency identification tracking and develop an instrumental variable approach to account for endogeneity. Their analysis reveals that the elasticity of unplanned spending on travel distance is 57% higher than the uncorrected ordinary least squares estimate. Simulations based on the authors' estimates suggest that strategically promoting three product categories through mobile promotion could increase unplanned spending by 16.1%, compared with the estimated effect of a benchmark strategy based on relocating three destination categories (7.2%). Furthermore, the authors conduct a field experiment to assess the effectiveness of mobile promotions and find that a coupon that required shoppers to travel farther from their planned path resulted in a substantial increase in unplanned spending ($21.29) over a coupon for an unplanned category near their planned path ($13.83). The results suggest that targeted mobile promotions aimed at increasing in-store path length can increase unplanned spending.","['shopper marketing', 'path data', 'radio frequency identification tracking', 'unplanned purchase', 'mobile promotionMODEL', 'PATH', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'BEHAVIOR', 'PURCHASE']","['path data', 'path data', 'radio frequency identification tracking', 'radio frequency identification tracking', 'radio frequency identification tracking', 'radio frequency identification tracking', 'path']",radio frequency identification tracking experiment

We propose that competitive interference is not inherently bad but may be beneficial under certain conditions.

However, in the presence of competitive advertising, old attribute information is suppressed, and new attribute information is successfully retrieved.","['nanCONSUMER MEMORY', 'BRAND EVALUATIONS', 'RECALL', 'CUES', 'SETS']",['recall'],recall information

A firm's export ratio is related to the size of the firm, but not to the firm's and the industry's R&D intensities. Follower firms are characterized by higher export ratios than market leaders.

"It could be argued that success in life is a function of a consumer's ability to get things done. The key step in getting things done is to get started. This research explores the effect of the categorization of time on task initiation. Specifically, we theorize that consumers use a variety of cues to categorize future points in time (events) into either events that are like the present event or those that are unlike the present event. When the deadline of a task is categorized in a like-the-present category, it triggers the default implemental mind-set and hence results in a greater likelihood of task initiation. A series of field and lab studies among farmers in India and undergraduate and MBA students in North America provided support to this theorizing. Our findings have implication for goal-striving strategy and choice architecture.","['nanMIND-SETS', 'CUES', 'PERCEPTION']",['cues'],task initiation
"Research summary: In family businesses, investment decisions often involve both socioemotional wealth and economic considerations. Focusing on new technology adoption, we argue that multiple dimensions of socioemotional wealth contribute to complex effects within different types of family firms-depending on the level of family control-as well as in contrast to non-family firms. Results based on cable TV operators from 1983 to 1987 confirm that family ownership correlates negatively with technology adoption, especially when family owners hold a minority rather than majority position. We also show contingencies based on performance improvements and competitive threats. Our arguments contribute new insights about the tensions between economic and socioemotional factors within minority family ownership that are absent from non-family firms and more pronounced than in majority family firms. Managerial summary: We find evidence of greater reluctance toward new technology adoption among firms with minority family influence than majority family influence. This suggests that goals related to socioemotional wealth only partly explain the cautious decision-making observed in family firms, with further caution arising from conflicting priorities between family and non-family owners. Recent performance improvements help offset the reluctance to adopt new technology, albeit to a lesser degree among firms with minority family ownership. High levels of competitive threats also offset the reduction in new technology adoption, and contrary to expectations, to a greater extent among minority family firms.

"Should manufacturers of products such as automobiles and household appliances offer cash rebates to all consumers at the time of purchase, or offer trade deals to retailers? The authors conduct an analytical inquiry that shows that choosing between these two types of price promotion critically depends on the consumer sensitivity to both regular and promotional prices. More specifically, when consumers are more (less) sensitive to promotions than to regular prices, manufacturers are better (worse) off offering trade deals (consumer rebates) rather than consumer rebates (trade deals). Consistent with traditional predictions found in the economic literature, either of the two promotions can be offered indiscriminately if consumers make no difference between promotional offers and regular-price reductions. The theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2010 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Powerful chief executives are found to be less likely than less powerful chief executives to be dismissed during performance downturns. Instead, they displace blame for poor performance onto their subordinates, the top managers of the organization, who subsequently are replaced, while the chief executive remains.

Evaluations of the chosen brand were more favorable when individuals with a prevention focus used decision strategies that enhanced the accuracy of a decision outcome than when they used strategies that facilitated progress toward a decision, whereas the opposite outcome occurred for those with a promotion focus. These findings emerged whether the decision strategies were prompted by instructions about how to make a decision or by the message presentation format, and they were mediated by a subjective experience of confidence. These observations suggest that judgments are influenced by the decision makers' feelings about how information is processed that are independent of the message content.","['nanCONSUMER CHOICE', 'FIT', 'PREVENTION', 'PERSUASION', 'PROMOTION', 'FOCUS', 'MODERATOR', 'FLUENCY', 'EASE']","['prevention', 'promotion', 'focus']",judgments prevention promotion

"Nonfinancial measures (NFMs) are a common feature of strategic performance management frameworks. We examine the role of one widely used NFM: customer satisfaction, in one aspect of strategic performance management: CEO compensation schemes. Drawing on agency theory precepts, we hypothesize that the extent to which firms link CEO compensation to customer satisfaction is influenced by satisfaction's ability to act as a leading indicator of future profitability (lead indicator strength). We further hypothesize that the extent to which customer satisfaction's lead indicator strength influences the weighting of satisfaction in CEO compensation schemes has a positive influence on future shareholder value. Our empirical results offer strong support for both hypotheses and extend research on the use and efficacy of NFMs in CEO compensation schemes.

"We investigate the role of high distance in trust erosion between small partners. High distance is known to hinder the formation of trust between potential partners, but its role in trust erosion in established partnerships is less understood by international business scholars. Through a qualitative longitudinal study, we extend current theory of how high distance affects the trust dynamics between cross-border partners. Specifically, we unearth three interrelated mechanisms that together explain how and why trust can erode due to high distance. We show that, before a partnership is formed, high distance can lead partners to erroneously attribute cues to a potential partner's high quality, leading to over-expectations of partner performance. Once the partnership is operational, high distance hinders actors' ability to understand situational factors associated with disappointing outcomes, and so they are attributed to failings of the partner. At the same time, distance-related challenges of bounded reliability render partners reluctant to discuss partnership outcomes. This can result in a vicious cycle of inertia as partners strive to protect goodwill while abandoning efforts to produce partnership outcomes because of doubts of the other's quality. Thus, our theoretical model illustrates the limitations of trust and explains how, paradoxically, high distance can facilitate both trust formation and trust erosion.","['Case theoretic approaches', 'China', 'Longitudinal', 'Process model', 'Small', 'and medium-sized enterprises', 'Trust', 'Trust erosionINTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS RESEARCH', 'COGNITION-BASED TRUST', 'INTERPERSONAL-TRUST', 'BOUNDED RELIABILITY', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE', 'INTEGRATIVE MODEL', 'EMERGING MARKETS', 'FIRM SIZE', 'PERFORMANCE']","['longitudinal', 'small', 'trust', 'bounded reliability', 'bounded reliability', 'performance']",trust business
"Earlier adopters of a product or service tend to be more valuable than later adopters. Does this empirical generalization equally apply to earlier adopters of a multichannel retailer's new online channel too? This study segments customers on the basis of their responses to a new online channel and investigates the effects of their online channel adoption on purchase volumes across segments. The data cover 12.5 years of purchase history and individual transactions at a large multichannel French retailer of natural health products. Contrary to conventional wisdom, it is not innovators or early adopters, but rather the late majority segment that purchases more than the other segments, both before and after online adoption. Adoption of the firm's new online channel does not influence purchase volumes of heavy shopper segments (late majority and innovators), whereas light shopper segments tend to increase their purchases after adopting this new channel.

"International marketing studies have extensively examined the antecedents of firms' marketing standardization/adaptation decisions. However, it is unclear whether such decisions, once planned, codetermine the choice between buying and building foreign subsidiaries. Analyzing a sample of 150 foreign entries by Dutch firms, the authors find that the level of marketing adaptation planned for a wholly owned subsidiary is positively related to the likelihood that the subsidiary will be established through an acquisition rather than through a green field investment. Moreover, the authors find substantial evidence that this positive relationship is stronger for firms that (1) are establishing relatively larger subsidiaries, (2) have less experience with the industry entered, or (3) are entering less developed countries. The findings show that firms pursuing higher levels of marketing adaptation assign more value to the marketing adaptation advantages of acquisitions over greenfields, especially if the risks associated with implementing the planned adaptation level are high. In addition, firms typically strive for a fit between their international marketing strategy and their mode of foreign establishment.","['acquisitions', 'establishment mode choice', 'greenfields', 'planned marketing adaptationENTRY MODE CHOICE', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'START-UP', 'INTERNATIONAL STANDARDIZATION', 'JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES', 'TRANSACTION COSTS', 'NATIONAL CULTURE', 'STRATEGIC FIT', 'REAL OPTIONS', 'PERFORMANCE']","['acquisitions', 'greenfields']",adaptation decisions advantages
"Does the presence of multiple and unrelated family controllers improve firm performance?

Finally, we argue that the focal relationship follows an inverted U-shaped pattern depending on the number of families controlling the firm.

"Purpose - The purpose of this study is twofold. The first is to provide a structured review of the vast amount of outsourcing literature that has accumulated in the past two decades using a decision support framework. The second purpose is to statistically analyze the contents of the studies to identify commonalities as well as gaps, in order to suggest directions for future research. Design/methodology/approach - The contents of more than 200 publications are analyzed using a variety of approaches. A decision support framework is used to first classify whether the studies address outsourcing benefits, risks, motivations or factors. Next, each classification is further described by the type of benefits, risks, etc. Additional relevant contents such as type of organization, and the location of the outsourcing practice are also considered. Multivariate analyses consisting of cross tabulations, chi-square testing and cluster analysis are used for categorizing the studies with the aim of identifying relationships among the studies which are not apparent when they are considered individually. Findings - A number of trends and relationships are identified. For example, most studies focus on US for-profit organizations and are typically theoretical, discussing benefits, risks and motivators. On the other hand, the research on outsourcing practices of non-profit organizations, where objectives for outsourcing are typically politically driven, is found to be scarce. Furthermore, the results of the cluster analysis indicate that the studies can be grouped into six clusters where the five small clusters are characterized by strong relationships with a few variables while the large cluster is characterized by variables that are not addressed in the studies. Practical implications - Outsourcing has become commonplace in today's businesses. In addition to outsourcing in profit seeking organizations, there is considerable outsourcing effort in governmental and non-profit organizations also. It is not easy for managers who are exploring outsourcing opportunities for the very first time and academicians who want to build upon existing studies to search the literature to find what they are looking for.

"The informal economy consists of economic activities that occur outside of formal institutional boundaries but which remain within informal institutional boundaries for large segments of society. We draw from diverse disciplines to frame research concerning entrepreneurship in the informal economy around three separate theories: institutional theory, motivation-related theories from a sociological perspective, and resource allocation theory. Each of these theories provides a complementary lens through which to examine the incentives, constraints, motivations, strategies, and abilities of entrepreneurs to operate and grow their ventures in the informal economy. Employing these theoretical perspectives facilitates efforts to highlight the breadth of informal economy research in different domains and lays foundations for future entrepreneurship research.

"The authors propose amodel relating a product's comparative price to the construal level of its associated communications and show how perceived expensiveness shapes consumers' response to the wording of marketing communications. A series of six studies shows that for both absolute low-and high-cost product categories, comparatively expensive (inexpensive) products are preferred when accompanied by high-construal (low-construal) messages, due to the conceptual fluency of the match between price-induced psychological distance and construal level. The model provides novel implications for designing effective marketing communications: comparatively expensive versions of objectively low-priced products (e.g., an expensive chocolate truffle) are best promoted through more abstract slogans, whereas comparatively affordable versions of objectively high-priced products (e.g., an inexpensive diamond pendant) are best promoted using more concrete slogans. By emphasizing the link between comparative price and the matching level of construal, the authors contribute to a richer view of the interplay between price and product communication in marketing.","['price', 'construal level', 'psychological distance', 'expensiveness', 'advertisingCONSTRUAL-LEVEL', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'BRAND EVALUATION', 'REGULATORY FIT', 'MIND-SET', 'CONSUMER', 'FLUENCY', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'QUALITY']","['price', 'construal level', 'construal level', 'psychological distance', 'psychological distance', 'expensiveness', 'psychological distance', 'psychological distance', 'consumer', 'fluency']",comparative price construal level model
"For retailers, format portfolio management is a core marketing operation, but has received little attention in the marketing literature. This study analyzes the relationship between format diversification and retailer performance in a global setting, where retailers as part of their geographic expansion process often employ format diversification. The dual strategies of geographic diversification and format diversification substantially complicate the diversification-performance relationship. Using a six year panel data set for leading global retailers, we find a positive impact for geographic diversification, a negative impact for format diversification and a negative interaction for the dual strategies, supporting a single focus diversification strategy. We further show the consistency of our findings using a series of model robustness checks.","['Retail format', 'Financial performance', ""Tobin's Q"", 'Diversification portfolio', 'Dynamic panel modelENTRY-MODE CHOICE', 'NATIONAL CULTURE', 'INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION', 'GLOBALIZING RETAIL', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'SERVICE FIRMS', 'PANEL-DATA', 'STRATEGY']","['panel data', 'panel data', 'strategy']",format portfolio management diversification
"Managers are increasingly uncertain over the source (home nation or foreign nation) of antitrust holdup for domestic mergers with significant international implications. I propose a conceptual framework that predicts the source of antitrust holdup for domestic mergers. I find an industry's global competitiveness to be the primary driver behind holdup source. Further, I factor institutional conditions to yield more precise predictions tailored to the cross-national environment for antitrust policy. Exploratory empirical tests based on the merger policies of 2 7 antitrust jurisdictions over the 1992-2000 period provide support for baseline predictions. Finally, I generate prescriptive propositions that yield implications for effective political strategies.

"How many positive claims should firms use to produce the most positive impression of a product or service? This article posits that when consumers know that the message source has a persuasion motive, the optimal number of positive claims is three. Increasing the number of claims improves consumer perceptions until the fourth claim, at which point consumers' persuasion knowledge causes them to view all the claims with skepticism. The studies herein establish and explore this pattern, which the authors refer to as the charm of three. An initial experiment indicates that impressions peak at three claims for sources with a persuasion motive but not for sources without a persuasion motive. The second experiment indicates that this effect occurs for attitudes and impressions and that increased skepticism at four or more claims explains the effect. Two final experiments examine the mental process by which the charm of three occurs by investigating how cognitive load and sequential claims influence the effect.","['behavioral decision making', 'impression formation', 'perception', 'set-size effectIMPRESSION-FORMATION', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'BRAND', 'MODEL', 'ADVERTISEMENTS', 'MEMORY', 'COVARIATION', 'SKEPTICISM', 'MANAGEMENT', 'REPETITION']","['perception', 'skepticism']",claims persuasion knowledge load
"We suggest that consumers assess the taste of a food or beverage by comparing the human values symbolized by the product to their human value priorities. When there is value-symbol congruency, they experience a better taste and aroma and develop a more favorable attitude and behavior intention; incongruence has the opposite effect. Participants in two taste tests were told the correct identity of a product or misinformed. Participants who endorsed the values symbolized by the product (that they thought they were tasting) evaluated the product more favorably. The implications for marketing strategy, self-congruity theory, and the assimilation effect are discussed.","['nanPRODUCT INFORMATION', 'CONSUMER RESPONSES', 'BRAND PERSONALITY', 'FOOD CHOICE', 'FAT-CONTENT', 'CONSUMPTION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'PERCEPTION', 'PREFERENCE', 'NUTRITION']",['behavior'],
"This paper examines how and under what conditions alliance portfolio diversity influences a firm's innovative performance, with special attention being given to potential performance differences between multinational corporations (MNCs) and domestic firms. Analyses of data from 1045 German firms, among which 598 MNCs, revealed an inverted U-shaped relationship between alliance portfolio diversity and MNCs' innovative performance. Findings also indicate MNCs to be better positioned than their domestic counterparts with regards to translating alliance portfolio diversity into superior innovative performance. Importantly though, this only holds for MNCs equipped with strong internal R&D capabilities and, to some extent, high human capital. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"There is increasing interest in the literature about the notion of a contingent approach to product development process design. This interest stems from the realization that different types of projects carried out in different environments are likely to require quite different development processes if they are to be successful. Stated more formally, a contingent view implies that the performance impact of different development practices is likely to be mediated by the context in which those practices operate. This article provides evidence to support such a view. Our work examines whether projects in which the development process matches the context achieve superior performance. We focus on two sources of uncertainty that generate challenges for project teams: platform uncertainty, reflecting the uncertainty generated by the amount of new design work that must be undertaken in a project; and market uncertainty, reflecting the uncertainty faced in determining customer requirements for the product under development. We develop hypotheses for how these sources of uncertainty are likely to influence the relationships between a number of specific development practices and performance. We then test these hypotheses using data from a sample of 29 Internet software development projects. Our results provide evidence to support a contingent view of development process design. We show that in projects facing greater uncertainty, investments in architectural design, early technical feedback, and early market feedback have a stronger association with Performance. The latter relationships are influenced by the specific sources from which this uncertainty stems: platform uncertainty mediating the impact of early technical feedback and market uncertainty mediating the impact of early market feedback. Our results also indicate that while greater uncertainty is associated with making later changes to a product's design, this practice is not associated with performance. Our findings suggest that managers carefully must evaluate both the levels and sources of uncertainty facing a project before designing the most appropriate process for its execution. In particular, they should explore the use of specific development practices based upon their usefulness in resolving the specific types of uncertainty faced. Importantly, these decisions must be made at the start of a project; with purposeful investments to create a process that best matches the context. Reacting to uncertainty ex-post, without such investments in place, is unlikely to prove a successful strategy.","['nanPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SUCCESS', 'FLEXIBILITY', 'FAILURE', 'DESIGN', 'TIME']",['design'],design performance impact
"The assumption that 'local search' constrains the direction of corporate R&D is central in evolutionary perspectives on technological change and competition. In this paper, we propose a network-analytic approach for identifying the evolution of firms' technological positions. The approach (1) permits graphical and quantitative assessments of the extent to which firms' search behavior is locally bounded, and (2) enables firms to be positioned and grouped according to the similarities in their innovative capabilities. The utility of the proposed framework is demonstrated by an analysis of strategic partnering and the evolution of the technological positions of the 10 largest Japanese semiconductor producers from 1982 to 1992.","['local search', 'evolutionary theory', 'technological change', 'innovationCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'INNOVATION', 'ECOLOGY', 'FIRMS']","['local search', 'local search', 'technological change', 'technological change', 'firms']",firms japanese

"Mass customization systems provide consumers with the opportunity to create unique self-designed products. To retailers and manufacturers, the segment of customers configuring unique products is of considerable interest given their potential impact on product diffusion and profits. Yet field evidence suggests that only a minority of consumers use the full potential of such systems by configuring products with unique options (e.g., a volcano red car instead of a white one). The present research shows that the uniqueness of mass-customized products depends on consumer narcissism. Specifically, we demonstrate that (a) consumers higher in trait narcissism configure more unique products (while controlling for self-esteem and need for uniqueness) and (b) state narcissism can be primed via marketing communications to influence product uniqueness. Our findings suggest that firms should consider customers' innate narcissistic tendencies, as well as the ability to influence their current states of mind, to exploit the largely untapped individualization potential of mass customization systems.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and the extent to which they are prepared to meet SCM challenges through the use of modern planning and control methods. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a cross-sectional survey of 200 Norwegian companies with informants mainly related to the SCM function and from top management. Findings - The findings clearly indicate that SMEs give less attention to planning and control methods than LEs. SMEs are less satisfied with the methods applied; less concerned with methods supporting SCM on product quality, rationalisation of operations and capital cost rationalisation; less focused on system integration with other actors in the supply chain; and less focused on EDI and e-based solutions. Research limitations/implications - The study focuses primarily on managerial components and excluded logistics structures and business processes that are more or less inter-related. Practical implications - Horizontal cooperation or vertical integration can reduce the information technology gap by sharing planning and control systems. The suppliers of support systems should consider delivering complete turn-key solutions for revitalising the supply chain functions, specifically targeted towards SMEs. Originality/value - The strength of this study is that it has been able to identify systematic differences between LEs and SMEs across sectors with respect to how SCM challenges are met.","['small to medium-sized enterprises', 'distribution management', 'electronic commerce', 'business planning', 'production planning and control', 'NorwayPOWER REGIMES', 'MANAGEMENT', 'BUSINESSES']",['management'],medium sized information technology met
"This study investigates the impact of non-competition agreements on the type of R&D activity undertaken by companies. Non-competition agreements, by reducing outbound mobility and knowledge leakages to competitors, make high-risk R&D projects relatively more valuable than low-risk ones. Thus, they induce companies to choose riskier R&D projects, such that corporate inventions are more likely to lie in the tails of the inventions' value distribution (as breakthroughs or failures) and be in novel technological areas. This study uses data about U. S. patent applications from 1990 to 2000 and considers longitudinal variation in the enforcement of non-compete clauses. The results indicate that in states with stricter enforcement, companies undertake riskier R&D paths than in states that do not enforce non-compete agreements as strictly.

"Visual simulation is currently the primary technique used to optimize virtual presence in e-tailing, but it entails high costs. For e-tail companies with limited financial resources, customer-company communications, instead of using visual simulation, are based mostly on text (e. g., product attributes, company information). This study explores the influence of text-based e-tail content on virtual presence and the mechanism underlying this influence by testing (1) the effect of cue multiplicity on telepresence and social presence and (2) the dynamics of how presence perceptions affect decision affirmation. A total of 407 participants in the main experiment were exposed to a fictitious e-tail Web site, and the cue multiplicity of the text-based e-tail content was manipulated. The results supported all the hypotheses but one. First, a greater number of cues led to greater perception of telepresence and social presence, providing support for the hypothesized effect of cue multiplicity in text-based e-tail content on virtual presence. Second, telepresence increased Web site trust, ultimately contributing to shoppers' decision affirmation; however, the effect of telepresence on e-shopping enjoyment was not confirmed. Finally, social presence significantly improved Web site trust, e-shopping enjoyment, and social affirmation, all of which improved decision affirmation. The findings illuminate the role of cue multiplicity in e-tail text as a crucial antecedent to virtual presence and decision affirmation. A strategic manipulation of e-tail text should be further considered by managers of various virtual marketplaces as a cost-efficient and effective way of helping the shopper's decision process.","['Cue multiplicity', 'decision affirmation', 'e-shopping enjoyment', 'e-tail presence', 'social approval', 'social presence', 'text-based e-tail content', 'trust', 'virtual presence', 'Web site trustCOMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION', 'SOCIAL PRESENCE', 'E-COMMERCE', 'WEB SITE', 'CONSUMER RESPONSES', 'TRUST', 'EXPERIENCE', 'INTERACTIVITY', 'DETERMINANTS', 'HAPPINESS']","['cue multiplicity', 'cue multiplicity', 'decision affirmation', 'decision affirmation', 'e shopping enjoyment', 'e shopping enjoyment', 'e shopping enjoyment', 'social presence', 'social presence', 'text based e tail content', 'text based e tail content', 'text based e tail content', 'text based e tail content', 'text based e tail content', 'trust', 'virtual presence', 'virtual presence', 'social presence', 'social presence', 'web site', 'web site', 'trust']",simulation virtual presence e tailing telepresence social trust
"Brand communities offer effective means to achieve favorable brand outcomes, such as enhanced consumer brand loyalty. But what drives brand community success, and how can managers evaluate their communities' performance? Based on Mufiiz and O'Guinn (2001) the existing literature suggests high levels of consciousness of kind, shared rituals and traditions, and a sense of moral responsibility among community members, which imply a notion of brand community character. This study accordingly argues that community members' perceptions of the brand community character (PBCC) should lead to positive outcomes for both the community and the brand. Neither PBCC nor its three characteristics have been measured empirically previously, so this study develops an initial scale. Six consecutive studies to develop the PBCC scale demonstrate its reliability and validity, while a further study affirms that PBCC has a positive relationship with relevant brand outcomes.

"Drawing upon theory on social judgments and impression formation from social psychology, this paper explores the socio-cognitive processes that shape the formation of favorable and unfavorable organizational reputations. Specifically, we suggest that stakeholders make distinctions between an organization's capabilities and its character. We explain the nature and function of each and articulate the manner in which judgment heuristics and biases manifest in the development of capability and character reputations. In doing so, this research explores both the positive and negative sides of organizational reputation by examining the manner in which different types of reputations are built or damaged, and how these processes influence the ability of managers to enhance and protect these reputations.

"What is it about context that determines whether a target will be assimilated to the context or contrasted away from it? We suggest that it is the dimensional overlap in the range of values that contextual and target stimuli might take. Four experiments demonstrate that overlap or lack thereof between context and target ranges determines context effects. Assimilation occurs when the context and target ranges overlap, but contrast occurs when the ranges do not overlap. Furthermore, perceptions of amount of overlap or lack thereof determine the amount of assimilation or contrast. These results occur regardless of whether research participants are asked to explicitly consider ranges or not prior to judgment, whether the context consists of attributes or exemplars, and whether the target is novel or familiar.","['nanFLEXIBLE CORRECTION', 'SOCIAL JUDGMENT', 'NAIVE THEORIES', 'CONTRAST', 'ASSIMILATION', 'MODEL', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'SIMILARITY', 'BEHAVIOR']","['contrast', 'assimilation']",research

In this article, the author argues that external validity concerns should be given more attention, particularly in TA research. Three recommendations are made for implementing these concerns: (1) consumer behavior articles should be required to have a section indicating how increased levels of external validity can be obtained with other studies, (2) joint ventures between consumer behavior and marketing science researchers can be profitable and should be encouraged, and (3) analyses of electronic scanner panel data or other secondary data can be used to generate higher levels of external validity.

"Marketers are being challenged by a deluge of data that is well beyond the capacity of their organizations to comprehend and use. Their strategies are not keeping up with the disruptive effects of technology-empowered customers; the proliferation of media, channel, and customer contact points; or the possibilities for microsegmentation. Closing the widening gap between the accelerating complexity of their markets and the limited ability of their organizations to respond demands new thinking about marketing capabilities. Three adaptive capabilities are needed: (1) Vigilant market learning that enhances deep market insights with an advance warning system to anticipate market changes and unmet needs, (2) adaptive market experimentation that continuously learns from experiments, and (3) open marketing that forges relationships with those at the forefront of new media and social networking technologies and mobilizes the skills of current partners. The benefits of these adaptive capabilities will only be realized in organizations that are more resilient and free-flowing, with vigilant leadership and more adaptive business models.","['adaptive marketing capabilities', 'open marketing', 'data deluge', 'market orientation', 'digital marketing', 'strategic marketing', 'market learningORIENTATION', 'STRATEGY', 'MODEL']","['open marketing', 'open marketing', 'model']",market experimentation models

The purpose for developing this profile is primarily to provide relevant information for non-Chinese business people, especially Westerners, who plan to engage in business in China. This profile is based on measures of individual values (Individualism, Collectivism and Confucianism) relevant to China and business. Our findings suggest that the New Generation manager is more individualistic and more likely to act independently, while taking risks in the pursuit of profits. However, these New managers are, likewise, not forsaking their Confucian values.

"This article examines key success factors for designing and delivering combinations of goods and services (i.e., hybrid offerings) in business markets. Goods manufacturers, unlike pure service providers, find themselves in a unique position to grow revenues through hybrid offerings but must learn how to leverage unique resources and build distinctive capabilities. Using case studies and depth interviews with senior executives in manufacturing companies, the authors develop a resource-capability framework as a basis for research and practice. Executives identify four critical resources: (1) product usage and process data derived from the firm's installed base of physical goods, (2) product development and manufacturing assets, (3) an experienced product sales force and distribution network, and (4) a field service organization. In leveraging these specific resources, successful firms build five critical capabilities: (1) service-related data processing and interpretation capability, (2) execution risk assessment and mitigation capability, (3) design-to-service capability, (4) hybrid offering sales capability, and (5) hybrid offering deployment capability. These capabilities influence manufacturers' positional advantage in two directions: differentiation and cost leadership. The authors propose a new typology of industrial services and discuss how resources and capabilities affect success across categories of hybrid offers.","['hybrid offerings', 'service transition strategies', 'resource-based view', 'business-to-business services', 'service classification', 'positional advantageCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'PRODUCT', 'STRATEGIES', 'MODEL', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'ORGANIZATION', 'RELIABILITY', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'ORIENTATION', 'INNOVATION']","['hybrid offerings', 'hybrid offerings', 'product', 'organization']",
"Although parents often try not to favor one child, we examine whether specific environmental factors might bias parents to favor children of one sex over the other. This research draws on theory in evolutionary biology suggesting that investment in female versus male offspring depends on resource availability. Applying this to consumers, a series of experiments show that poor economic conditions favor resource allocations to daughters over sons. For example, poor conditions led people to bequeath more assets to girls in their will, and to choose girls to receive a US Treasury bond and a beneficial extracurricular activity. It is proposed that this happens because spending on children represents a reproductive investment, and that boys' and girls' relative reproductive value varies with economic conditions. Supporting this account, perceptions of which child will have more children statistically mediates the effect of economic conditions on preferences for girls. Consequently, the effect is strengthened as a child approaches reproductive age, and it is moderated by individual differences (risk aversion and monogamy) directly related to our theoretical model. This research contributes to the consumer behavior literature by revealing how, why, and when environmental factors influence spending on girls versus boys.","['parental decision making', 'family spending', 'economic recessions', 'evolutionary psychologyCROSS-NATIONAL DIFFERENCES', 'FAMILY DECISION-MAKING', 'SEX-RATIO', 'PARENTAL INVESTMENT', 'CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION', 'CONSUMER SOCIALIZATION', 'RISK-AVERSION', 'CHILDREN', 'SELECTION', 'BEHAVIOR']","['risk aversion', 'risk aversion', 'children', 'behavior']",age monogamy
"This research provides an empirical test of the Twitter effect, which postulates that microblogging word of mouth (MWOM) shared through Twitter and similar services affects early product adoption behaviors by immediately disseminating consumers' post-purchase quality evaluations. This is a potentially crucial factor for the success of experiential media products and other products whose distribution strategy relies on a hyped release. Studying the four million MWOM messages sent via Twitter concerning 105 movies on their respective opening weekends, the authors find support for the Twitter effect and report evidence of a negativity bias. In a follow-up incident study of 600 Twitter users who decided not to see a movie based on negative MWOM, the authors shed additional light on the Twitter effect by investigating how consumers use MWOM information in their decision-making processes and describing MWOM's defining characteristics. They use these insights to position MWOM in the word-of-mouth landscape, to identify future word-of-mouth research opportunities based on this conceptual positioning, and to develop managerial implications.","['Word of mouth communication', 'Microblogging', 'Twitter', 'Early adoption', 'MoviesMEDIA RICHNESS', 'FILM-CRITICS', 'CONVERSATIONS', 'PRODUCTS', 'REVIEWS', 'SUCCESS', 'SALES', 'POWER']","['microblogging', 'twitter', 'products', 'success']",twitter word of mouth movies insights
"If history matters for organization theory, then we need greater reflexivity regarding the epistemological problem of representing the past; otherwise, history might be seen as merely a repository of ready-made data. To facilitate this reflexivity, we set out three epistemological dualisms derived from historical theory to explain the relationship between history and organization theory: (1) in the dualism of explanation, historians are preoccupied with narrative construction, whereas organization theorists subordinate narrative to analysis; (2) in the dualism of evidence, historians use verifiable documentary sources, whereas organization theorists prefer con., structed data; and (3) in the dualism of temporality, historians construct their own periodization, whereas organization theorists treat time as Constant for chronology. These three dualisms underpin our explication of four alternative research strategies for organizational history: corporate history, consisting of a holistic, objectivist narrative of a corporate entity; analytically structured history, narrating theoretically conceptualized structures and events; serial history, using replicable techniques to analyze repeatable facts; and ethnographic history, reading documentary sources against the grain. Ultimately, we argue that our epistemological dualisms will enable organization theorists to justify their theoretical stance in relation to a range of strategies in organizational history, including narratives constructed from documentary sources found in organizational archives.","['nanTEACHING HISTORY', 'BUSINESS HISTORY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'RECONCEPTUALIZATION', 'HISTORIOGRAPHY', 'EXPERIENCE', 'NARRATIVES', 'EVOLUTION', 'ORIGINS', 'SLAVERY']",['narratives'],
"For a shopping mall, sales leakage occurs when consumer purchases facilitated by the mall are finalized outside it. These sales include, for example, catalog orders filled at the leased premises in a physical mall; For an Internet mall, they include the ones consumers make on an on-line store's website after learning about the store from an Internet mall website. While these sales are difficult to track in the physical mall, Internet malls like Yahoo can track them by placing cookies on consumers when they visit the mall. The challenge for a mall owner then is to design an appropriate pricing model which takes sales leakage into account. In fact, Yahoo currently uses an All-Revenue-Share Fee with Yahoo collecting from on-line stores a share of all sales revenue, regardless of whether the purchase was made through the mall or directly from the store's own URL. We explore this new All-Revenue-Share Fee model, compare it with the commonly used Fixed Fee model and the two-part tariff model, and identify the model with the highest profits for the mall under different conditions. We suggest that although an All-Revenue-Share Fee is appealing for Internet malls due to its ability to capture sales leakage directly, it may cause the stores to refrain from joining the mall in certain circumstances. Thus, in certain situations charging a fixed monthly fee can actually be more profitable for the mall versus the All-Revenue-Share Fee model. We also examine how mall and product category characteristics as well as market expansion affect the optimal pricing strategy. We show that a mall should price discriminate across product categories, not just by charging different amounts of fees, but by using different pricing models. Our research provides many managerial implications on how to price over time. (C) 2008 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A large body of research indicates, however, that preferences often are labile. That is, preferences can be reversed depending on factors such as how the preference is elicited. In three studies, we examine the effect of familiarity in two preference-elicitation tasks, choice and matching judgments. We provide evidence of an interaction between familiarity and response mode (choice or matching) in each study. In study 3, we test the explanation that preference reversals may occur when the interaction of response mode with product-category familiarity leads to systematic changes in attribute weighting.","['nanCHOICE', 'REVERSALS', 'INFORMATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'EXPERIENCE', 'DECISIONS']","['reversals', 'information', 'decisions']",choice
"It is clearly recognized that service providers often have an incomplete and fragmentary understanding of their customers' relationship behaviors. Although it is clear that this incomplete understanding has serious implications for customer relationship management, and might even constitute a strategic risk, there have been no explicit attempts to analyze the phenomenon. The authors therefore introduce and develop the concept of the blind spot as a metaphor referring to situations where a service provider's visual field is obscured. The authors examine the phenomenon of blind spots in a temporal and a relational context, determine their consequences, and outline the implications for customer relationship management. A number of blind spot scenarios are presented in order to illustrate how blind spots obstruct the service provider's ability to make correct interpretations of customer relationships, and thereby also correct estimations of relationship stability. The conceptualization of blind spots as outlined in this article sheds light on the underlying mechanisms that drive customer behavior in terms of relationship stability and hence offers a deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of customer relationships. From a managerial point of view, proper monitoring systems and routines for analyzing relevant customer information play essential roles in understanding and managing blind spots.","['customer relationship behavior', 'relationship stability', 'blind spot', 'strategic uncertainty', 'phenomenologySERVICE PROVIDERS', 'MARKET-RESEARCH', 'CONSUMER', 'BEHAVIOR', 'TRUST', 'SATISFACTION', 'DISSOLUTION', 'COMMITMENT', 'FRAMEWORK', 'QUALITY']","['relationship stability', 'relationship stability', 'blind spot', 'blind spot', 'behavior']",blind spot
"A central problem in strategic management is how the inference 'sustainable competitive advantage generates sustainable superior performance' can be put into practice. In this article we develop a theoretical framework, to understand the causal relationships among (1) sustainable competitive advantage, (2) configuration, (3) dynamic capability, and (4) sustainable superior performance. We propose that a firm's competitive advantage, resource bundle configuration, and dynamic learning capability cannot be comprehended by outsiders. Its operational performance, however, can be captured by financial indicators. We promote an inductive Bayesian interpretation of the sustainable competitive advantage proposition. From this viewpoint, the presence or absence of competitive advantage may be reflected in the causal relationship between resource configuration, dynamic capability, and observable financial performance. We apply this theoretical framework to an example drawn from the global semiconductor industry, all area in which resource configuration and dynamic capability are essential to performance. The paper concludes with a summary of the proposed model and suggestions for future theoretical development of strategic management.

"This research focuses on the diffusion patterns of the adjacent generations of technology and its relation to the time that elapses between them (intergeneration time). The authors analyze 45 new technologies in 15 industries and find that the adoption curves systematically vary across generations from 2 years for dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips to more than 30 years for steelmaking. The longer the intergeneration time, the slower the adoption of the subsequent technology. Even though once the adoption begins imitation is greater for subsequent technologies, the slow initial innovation rate, driven by resistance to upgrading, retards adoption. The authors also demonstrate that predictions based on intergeneration time plus average patterns are more accurate than data-based predictions early in life cycles when such predictions are most crucial. Improved early predictions can provide advantages in terms of both making go versus no-go decisions and planning marketing and production.","['nanSUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS', 'MODEL', 'SUBSTITUTION', 'MARKET', 'COMPETITION', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'MULTILEVEL']","['market', 'technology']",innovation
"In developing countries, weak institutional capacity to observe and regulate the economy discourages foreign capital inflows vital to venture investment. This informality effect may differ for migrant remittances, inflows less reliant on formal arrangements. We use institutional and transaction cost theories to propose that informality shifts migrant remittances toward venture funding. Analyses in 48 developing countries observed from 2001 to 2009 support our proposition. When the informal sector exceeds approximately 46% of GDP, remittances increase venture funding availability. Migrants and their remittances are vital to funding new businesses and entrepreneurially-led economic growth in developing countries where substantial informality deters other foreign investors.

"Research Summary: This article extends prior research on the performance implications of the fit between a firm's strategic orientation and its pay system design. Whereas prior research has shown that matching the pay system design to the strategic orientation of the firm generally contributes to higher performance, most studies have examined the pay systems of the upper echelons and employees separately. Based on an analysis that accounts for both horizontal and vertical pay dispersion, we find that, whereas growth-oriented firms (prospectors) tend to benefit from high horizontal pay dispersion, efficiency-oriented firms (defenders) perform better with high vertical pay dispersion and low relative base pay. Overall, our findings contribute to an improved understanding of how to optimize the pay systems of firms with different strategic orientations. Managerial Summary: We study how the optimal configuration of the overall pay system differs between firms that pursue growth-oriented and efficiency-oriented strategies. Our results show that growth-oriented firms (prospectors) benefit from pay structures with relatively large pay differentials horizontally between employees based on ability, effort, and results. Efficiency-oriented firms (defenders), on the other hand, benefit from pay structures with relatively larger differences in pay across organizational levels vertically. Our findings suggest that while defenders should pay special attention to average pay levels to avoid over compensating their employees relative to competitors, prospectors should pay attention to the CEO-employee pay differentials to avoid overcompensating executives relative to employees. Overall, our findings provide further evidence on the importance of matching the pay system design to a firm's strategy.","['contingency theory', 'incentives', 'pay system', 'performance', 'strategic orientationBEHAVIORAL AGENCY MODEL', 'MANAGERIAL RISK-TAKING', 'COMPENSATION STRATEGY', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'REWARD SYSTEMS', 'INCENTIVES', 'DISPERSION', 'TURNOVER']","['pay system', 'pay system', 'performance', 'dispersion']",pay system upper pay dispersion
"This paper focuses on dynamic capabilities and, more generally, the resource-based view of the firm. We argue that dynamic capabilities are a set of specific and identifiable processes such as product development, strategic decision making, and alliancing. They are neither vague nor tautological. Although dynamic capabilities are idiosyncratic in their details and path dependent in their emergence, they have significant commonalities across firms (popularly termed 'best practice'). This suggests that they are more homogeneous, fungible, equifinal and substitutable than is usually assumed. In moderately dynamic markets, dynamic capabilities resemble the traditional conception of routines. They are detailed, analytic stable processes with predictable outcomes. In contrast, in high-velocity markets, they are simple, highly experiential and fragile processes with unpredictable outcomes. Finally, well-known learning mechanisms guide the evolution of dynamic capabilities. In moderately dynamic markets, the evolutionary emphasis is on variation. In high-velocity markets, it is on selection. At the level of REV, we conclude that traditional REV misidentifies the locus of long-term competitive advantage in dynamic markers, overemphasizes the strategic logic of leverage, and reaches a boundary condition in high-velocity markets.

"The authors empirically examine the effect of gas prices on grocery shopping behavior using Information Resources Inc. panel data from 2006 to 2008, which track panelists' purchases of almost 300 product categories across multiple retail formats. The authors quantify the impact on consumers' total spending and examine the potential avenues for savings when consumers shift from one retail format to another, from national brands to private labels, from regular-priced to promotional products, and from higher to lower price tiers. They find a substantial negative effect on shopping frequency and purchase volume and shifts away from grocery and toward supercenter formats. A greater shift occurs from regular-priced national brands to promoted ones than to private labels, and among national brand purchasers, bottom-tier brands lose share, midtier brands gain share, and top-tier brand share is relatively unaffected. The analysis also controls for general economic conditions and shows that gas prices have a much larger impact on grocery shopping behavior than broad economic factors.","['grocery expenditure', 'gas price effect', 'macroeconomic factors', 'retail format choice', 'promotions', 'private labelCONSUMER CONFIDENCE', 'BRAND CHOICE', 'RETAIL', 'DETERMINANTS', 'DEMAND', 'SEARCH', 'MARKET', 'COMPETITION', 'CATEGORY', 'INSIGHTS']",['retail'],grocery shopping behavior information resources retail formats impact frequency
"This study examines the effect of attractively priced acquisition campaigns on retention intention, and subsequently CLV, of existing customers. The main finding is that customers who are aware of the acquisition campaigns both have a significantly higher intention to stay and do actually stay longer than do customers who are unaware of these campaigns. However, since CLV is not only influenced by retention intention but also by revenues and costs, it is found that aware customers do not have a significantly different CLV than do unaware customers. The inclusion of attractiveness of the offer as an additional explanatory variable results in a positive effect of campaign attractiveness on retention intention, i.e. if the customer thinks the acquisition campaign is attractive, the retention intention will be higher. However, the effect that is found for intention cannot be directly translated in actual behavior.

"Adopting an information-process perspective, this article conceptualizes exploration orientation in terms of scope of information acquisition. In line with this conceptualization, a multidimensional operational measure of exploration orientation is developed and its internal consistency established. The measure appears to have nomological validity in that it behaves as predicted with measures of variables hypothesized to be related to exploration orientation. Consistent with the emerging co-evolution framework, environmental pressures as well as managerial intentions are found to influence an organization's exploration behaviour. Specifically, empirical results indicate that more environmental dynamism, a stronger organization mission, a prospector orientation and larger slack resources are associated with a greater exploration orientation. Implications, shortcomings and future research directions are discussed.","['nanLOCAL SEARCH', 'STRATEGIC TYPES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL', 'MILES', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'COEVOLUTION', 'DIMENSIONS', 'EVOLUTION', 'DECISION']",['evolution'],perspective exploration orientation evolution environmental slack resources
"In the consumer packaged goods (CPGs) industry, consumers base their purchase decisions in part on package size because different package sizes offer different levels of convenience. The heterogeneous preference for package size allows manufacturers to use package size as a competitive tool in order to raise margins in the face of higher production costs. By competing in package sizes, manufacturers may be able to soften the degree of price competition in the downstream market, and raise margins accordingly. In order to test this hypothesis, we develop a structural model of consumer demand, and manufacturers' joint decisions regarding package size and price applied to supermarket chain-level scanner data for the ready-to-eat breakfast cereal category. While others have argued that manufacturers reduce package sizes as a means of raising unit prices in a hidden way, we show that package size and price are strategic complements downsizing intensifies price competition, which does not allow manufacturers to raise unit prices through package downsizing. Therefore, package downsizing does not yield a desirable outcome for manufactures. On the other hand, retailers benefit from package downsizing, as it leads to lower wholesale prices, and higher category profits. (C) 2016 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"The study is theoretically grounded in the resource-based view and applied to a service industry-tourism. It examined the performance of small ventures by utilizing an integrated dynamic model of entrepreneur choices and resource accumulation. Each phase in the process is added to previous one. Findings from 305 small tourism ventures revealed that the human capital of the entrepreneur, particularly managerial skills, were the greatest contributing factor to performance. This was followed by venture type. The study illustrates the unique nature of the entrepreneurial process among small ventures, often defined as lifestyle businesses. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

"This paper argues that the gap between the theoretical utility and the practical utility of the resource-based view (RBV) may be narrowed by operationalizing the theory more consistently with Penrose's original framework. The operationalization proposed here is a twofold approach. First, the RBV may be enhanced by the explicit recognition of Penrose's two classes of resources, namely, administrative resources and productive resources. This distinction suggests a focus on the administrative decisions of managers that lead to economic performance. Second, we argue that the RBV is a theory about extraordinary performers or outliers-not averages. Therefore, the statistical methods used in applying the theory must account for individual firm differences, and not be based on means, which statistically neutralize firm differences. We propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical methodology to examine the relationship between administrative decisions and economic performance over time. We develop and explain a measure of competitive advantage that goes beyond comparisons of economic performance. This Bayesian methodology allows us to make meaningful probability statements about specific, individual firms and the effects of the administrative decisions examined in this study.

"Diversity in social networks is often linked to enhanced creativity. Emerging research on exposure to diverse informational resources (e.g., ideas and knowledge), however, has painted a more complex picture regarding its effect on individuals' creative performance. This research examines the effects of culturally diverse networks on the flow of ideas and individuals' creativity. Combining social network analysis with experimental methods, two studies using different samples found that a culturally diverse network increases the likelihood of receiving culture-related novel ideas (but not other types of novel ideas) from network contacts, whether or not these contacts share one's own culture of origin. Additionally, the creativity effect of network diversity depends on the type of tasks. Networks' degree of cultural diversity increases creativity on tasks that draw on varied cultural-knowledge resources but not on other types of tasks. These findings highlight that network diversity provides access to specific forms of knowledge and has a domain-specific effect on creativity. Theoretical and practical implications for creativity and social network research are discussed.","['creativity', 'social network', 'culture', 'diversity', 'multiculturalismAFFECT-BASED TRUST', 'WEAK-TIES', 'DIVERSITY', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'EXPERIENCE', 'FRIENDSHIP', 'STRENGTH', 'MANAGERS', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'COLLABORATION']","['creativity', 'social network', 'social network', 'culture', 'diversity', 'diversity', 'knowledge']",

"Most studies in organization theory are retrospective and rely on historical data. Because more data are available about widely diffused practices or about large populations, studies typically focus on these. Using simulation, we demonstrate that such selective sampling of empirical settings has important implications for two major research programs in organization theory. Diffusion researchers typically study practices that have diffused widely. We show that this implies that they will underestimate contagion effects. Researchers in organizational ecology often study populations that have become large. We show that such selective sampling of populations can generate spurious non-monotonic density dependence. We discuss the implications of such selective sampling of empirical settings and suggest ways to correct for the bias.","['nanDENSITY DEPENDENCE', 'CONSUMER DURABLES', 'CUMULATIVE ADVANTAGE', 'MULTIDIVISIONAL FORM', 'PRODUCT INNOVATIONS', 'SOCIAL CONTAGION', 'DIFFUSION', 'EVOLUTION', 'MARKET', 'IMITATION']",['diffusion'],diffusion density dependence
"Research summary: I examine how acquisition motives relate to the distribution of post-acquisition performance. I argue that acquisitions motivated by operating synergies have the potential to experience greater gains than acquisitions driven by financial synergies but are harder to value and implement, making them more uncertain. Using SEC filings, conference calls and press releases to capture acquisition motives, I find that acquirers pursuing operating synergies are more likely to experience highly positive and highly negative long-term returns than acquirers pursuing financial synergies. I also find that acquisition experience and geographic proximity to targets soften acquirers' extreme downside outcomes in operating synergy acquisitions. My theory and results suggest that approaches that emphasize average outcomes for acquirers and use industry classifications to capture acquisition motives may be incomplete.Managerial summary: Managers engage in acquisitions for various reasons. In this study, I find that reasons related to operating synergies (e.g., revenue growth through new product offerings or cost savings through economies of scale) are more likely to result in extreme high and low performance outcomes for the acquiring firm compared to reasons related to financial synergies (e.g., diversification of cash flow streams). In addition, I find that the acquirer's prior acquisition experience and the geographic proximity between the target and acquirer help soften the extreme low performance outcomes related to operating synergies.

"This study hypothesizes and tests whether the degree to which managers exercise earnings discretion relates to their value system (i.e., culture) as well as the institutional features (i.e., legal environment) of their country. We find that uncertainty avoidance and individualism dimensions of national culture explain managers' earnings discretion across countries, and that this association varies with the strength of investor protection. This study extends prior literature by documenting that both national culture and institutional structure are important factors that explain corporate managers' earnings discretion practices around the world, and that the influences of these factors on earnings discretion are conditional on each other.

The business press is filled with examples about large firms that have successfully reduced cycle time. This article investigates the relative impact of product innovation and entry strategy on cycle time and initial market performance of small firms. Using a sample of seventy-three small manufacturing firms, Abdul Ali, Robert Krapfel, Jr., and Douglas LaBahn find that faster product development is associated with shorter break-even time. Their results also indicate that these firms are achieving shorter cycle time not by sacrificing product quality, but by keeping the technical content of the product simple. Past research has not taken into account this relationship, and this may be one of the reasons why researchers have often suggested conflicting impact of entry strategy on market performance.","['nanMARKET PIONEER ADVANTAGES', 'GOODS INDUSTRIES', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'REGRESSION', 'FASTER', 'POWER', 'SPEED']","['performance', 'faster']",impact innovation

"Research summary: This article focuses on organizational naming as a strategic choice organizations make to overcome liabilities of atypicality. We argue that, in markets presenting an illegitimacy discount, atypical organizations may use deliberate namesnames that communicate the market categories to which organizations claim membershipto offset the consequences of atypicality. Using data from the global hedge fund industry, we show that atypical hedge funds are more likely than typical funds to have deliberate names. Importantly, the selection of a deliberate name is economically significant. First, funds with deliberate names grow faster than funds without deliberate names, especially among atypical funds. Second, while atypicality heightened the likelihood of failure during the recent financial crisiseven after controlling for fund performancehaving a deliberate name mitigated this effect.Managerial summary: Differentiation is a core element of many organizations' competitive advantage. Nevertheless, as differentiation implies being atypical among one's competitors, differentiation strategies can also lead to an illegitimacy discount whereby differentiators are at risk of being misunderstood, miscategorized, and ignored by consumers. Here we investigate how atypical hedge fundsfunds that differentiate themselves from their competitors by investing in notably unique waysuse names to offset the potential consequences associated with the illegitimacy discount. Our analysis of more than 12,000 hedge funds over 12 years highlighted a trend whereby atypical hedge funds were more likely to choose names that unambiguously associated them with a known investment strategyfor instance, choosing the name Apex Global Macro Capital over simply Apex Capital. Importantly, name selection proved to be economically significant. For example, among atypical hedge funds, those with unambiguous names grew faster than those without. Furthermore, while being atypical increased the level of disinvestment during the recent financial crisis, having an unambiguous name reversed this effect. Organizational names play an important communication role with consumers, which, while highly symbolic, may also help resolve the dual organizational need to both conform to consumer expectations and differentiate from market competitors.

"Purpose - Inconsistent research output makes critical literature reviews crucial tools for assessing and developing the knowledge base within a research field. Literature reviews in the field of supply chain management (SCM) are often considerably less stringently presented than other empirical research. Replicability of the research and traceability of the arguments and conclusions call for more transparent and systematic procedures. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the importance of literature reviews in SCM. Design/methodology/approach - Literature reviews are defined as primarily qualitative synthesis. Content analysis is introduced and applied for reviewing 22 literature reviews of seven sub-fields of SCM, published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and 2009. A descriptive evaluation of the literature body is followed by a content analysis on the basis of a specific pattern of analytic categories derived from a typical research process. Findings - Each paper was assessed for the aim of research, the method of data gathering, the method of data analysis, and quality measures. While some papers provide information on all of these categories, many fail to provide all the information. This questions the quality of the literature review process and the findings presented in respective papers. Research limitations/implications - While 22 literature reviews are taken into account in this paper as the basis of the empirical analysis, this allows for assessing the range of procedures applied in previous literature reviews and for pointing to their strengths and shortcomings. Originality/value - The findings and subsequent methodological discussions aim at providing practical guidance for SCM researchers on how to use content analysis for conducting literature reviews.","['Supply chain management', 'Literature review', 'Research process', 'Content analysis', 'Replicability', 'Research results', 'Research methodsOPERATIONS MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FRAMEWORK', 'RELIABILITY', 'LOGISTICS']","['supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'literature review', 'literature review', 'research process', 'research process', 'content analysis', 'content analysis', 'replicability']",literature reviews supply chain management content analysis

"Marketers invest a lot of resources in product aesthetics and design, but does this strategy always lead to favorable consumer outcomes? While prior research suggests enhanced aesthetics should have a uniformly positive influence on pre-usage evaluations and choice, the present research examines the downstream effects of nondurable product aesthetics on consumption behavior and post-consumption affect. First, we document an inhibiting effect of aesthetics on actual consumption. We find that highly aesthetic products elicit greater perceptions of effort in their creation, and that consumers have an intrinsic appreciation for such effort. Because the consumption process indirectly destroys the effort invested to make the product beautiful, people reduce consumption of such products because usage would entail destroying something they naturally appreciate. Second, we show that in cases where individuals do consume a beautiful product, they exhibit lower consumption enjoyment and increased negative affect. These negative post-consumption outcomes are mediated in parallel by concerns over having actually destroyed the effort that made the product beautiful as well as the decrements in beauty that become visible when aesthetic products are made less attractive through consumption. Across a series of studies, we challenge the common assumption that enhanced aesthetics always lead to positive consumer outcomes.","['aesthetics', 'effort', 'product usage', 'consumption enjoyment', 'predicted vs. experienced utility', 'implicit self-theoriesREWARD VALUE', 'PLEASURE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'SELF', 'EXPERIENCE', 'JUDGMENTS', 'INFERENCE', 'RESPONSES', 'FLUENCY', 'DESIGN']","['aesthetics', 'effort', 'consumption enjoyment', 'consumption enjoyment', 'behavior', 'design']",product aesthetics
"This article explores the effects of changes in the initial venture team on a firm's failure risk by considering firm age. The results show that founder exits are especially critical for firm survival in the first years of a firm's existence, whereas the entry of a new team member is more beneficial in later years. Further, an investigation of multiple founder exits shows that the time that elapses between two exits has a U-shaped relationship with a firm's hazard risk. Discussing these findings in terms of imprinting and the liability of newness, we contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of venture team dynamics and firm survival.","['nanTOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS', 'VALLEY LAW FIRMS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL MORTALITY', 'SURVIVAL CHANCES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'IMPACT', 'INNOVATION', 'DYNAMICS', 'INDUSTRY', 'NEWNESS']","['dynamics', 'newness']",founder exits imprinting
"The exporting successes of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in industrialized countries have led to the increasing recognition of the potentially critical role of SMEs in export- and private-sector-led economic growth in many developing countries. Policies to assist more SMEs to export must be informed by any systematic differences between current exporters and non-exporters. This study employs the logit model to ascertain the explicability of why some SMEs are exporters and some are not (export propensity) in Swaziland, a small, landlocked African country. The often-used firm-specific and manager-related variables are utilized and a good fit is obtained. Foreign language proficiency is very highly significant in explaining high export propensity; so is the frequency of business-related foreign trips. A quadratic specification of the age-of-manager variable seems to resolve the seemingly contradictory effects of that variable reported in previous studies based on linear specification. Effectual policies must aim at upgrading the language skills of managers, assist with bona fide business-related foreign travel and target managers at the low-medium bracket of the age range.","['developing countries', 'export propensity', 'foreign language proficiency', 'logit model', 'small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)', 'SwazilandMANUFACTURING FIRMS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'PROMOTION', 'PROGRAMS']","['developing countries', 'developing countries', 'export propensity', 'export propensity', 'foreign language proficiency', 'foreign language proficiency', 'foreign language proficiency', 'logit model', 'logit model', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ']",model firm language
"The international marketing literature has suggested that the characteristics of the subsidiary-headquarters relationship play an important role in subsidiary knowledge development within the field of multinational corporations. However, few studies have examined the association between the subsidiary-headquarters relationship and the subsidiary strategic role and its effects on subsidiary knowledge development. In this article, the authors first examine the effect of four subsidiary-headquarters relational characteristics (socialization mechanisms, autonomy, shared values, and internal embeddedness) on subsidiary knowledge development. Then, building on configuration theory, the authors employ two perspectives of fit (moderation and profile deviation) to investigate the impact of fit between strategy and relational characteristics and examine their effects on subsidiary knowledge development. Using data from 184 U.K. foreign-owned subsidiaries operating in the knowledge-intensive business services sector, the authors confirm that internal embeddedness, socialization mechanisms, and autonomy are positively related to subsidiary knowledge development. Furthermore, the findings support the moderation and profile deviation perspectives and indicate that aligning the subsidiary's strategic role with relational characteristics can lead to superior knowledge development.","['knowledge development', 'configuration theory', 'subsidiary-headquarters relationships', 'knowledge-intensive business services', 'strategic fitPERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'STRATEGIC FIT', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'COMPETENCE DEVELOPMENT', 'MARKET RESPONSIVENESS', 'EMBEDDEDNESS', 'CAPABILITIES', 'INNOVATION', 'CREATION']","['knowledge development', 'knowledge development', 'configuration theory', 'configuration theory', 'knowledge intensive business services', 'knowledge intensive business services', 'knowledge intensive business services', 'knowledge intensive business services', 'multinational corporations', 'multinational corporations', 'embeddedness']",subsidiary headquarters knowledge development multinational corporations configuration theory
"Rising shareholder activism following poor corporate performance and a subsequent drop in shareholder value at many major U.S. corporations had rekindled interest in duality and corporate governance. Despite limited empirical evidence, duality (chairman of the board and CEO are the same individual) has been blamed, in many cases, for the poor performance, and failure of firms to adapt to a changing environment. In examining the relationship between duality and firm performance, this study considers the announcement effects of changes in duality status, accounting measures of operating performance for firms that have changed their duality structure, and long-term measures of performance for firms that have had a consistent history of a duality structure. Our results suggest that: (I) the market is indifferent to changes ina firm's duality status; (2) there is little evidence of operating performance changes around changes in duality status; and (3) there is only weak evidence that duality status affects long-term performance, after controlling for other factors that might impact that performance.","['duality', 'governance', 'performanceORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'CORPORATE-CONTROL', 'AGENCY', 'OWNERSHIP', 'SEPARATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'EFFICIENCY']","['duality', 'governance']",governance
"Today's industrial landscape is characterized by rapid change and systemic technologies. Rapid change results in ever shorter product life cycles that demand continual innovation from Firms. The systemic nature of technologies makes it difficult, if nor impossible, for any one firm to manufacture all components of a technological system. We propose that these challenges be met by designing technological systems that have the potential to yield economies of substitution. Additionally, we propose that these economies be realized by adopting the network mode of governance. We examine the network mode at three levels-intrafirm, interfirm, and institutional-to illuminate the inherent tension between cooperation and competition at each level, and to explore the implications of this tension for industrial dynamics.","['TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION', 'NETWORKS', 'REUSE', 'MODULARITY', 'UPGRADABILITY', 'STANDARDSNETWORK EXTERNALITIES', 'SOFTWARE REUSE', 'INNOVATION', 'COMPATIBILITY', 'MODEL', 'MICROCOMPUTER', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'HIERARCHIES', 'INDUSTRIES', 'EVOLUTION']",['innovation'],firms
"Research summary Social media is a powerful medium for examining strategic leaders' novel interactions and influence within and outside the firm. But, while studies on social media are popping up like kettle corn across disciplines, no conceptual framework for organizing, guiding, and inspiring research on social media engagement among strategic leaders has yet appeared. Toward this end, we first clarify the construct and develop a typological conceptualization of strategic leaders' social media engagement behaviors. Next, we introduce a theoretical framework and corresponding propositions for explaining the variations, mechanisms, and consequences of social media engagements. We conclude with implications for future research, including data collection and measurement. Managerial summary With the growing proliferation of social media platforms, today's executives are faced with a vast array of choices about how to use social media to engage with diverse stakeholders and online communities. Although avoidance continues to be a preference for many executives, the scale and scope of social media platforms offer executives unprecedented opportunities-as well as risks-to engage stakeholders. We develop and illustrate a framework of six archetypal engagement behaviors through which executives may leverage social media to reach, communicate, and interact with stakeholders in developing and executing strategy-for both good and ill. We then discuss the implications of these alternative playbooks for executive decision-making and firm outcomes.","['Social media engagement', 'strategic leaders', 'CEOs and executivesMEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES', 'SELF-ATTRIBUTION BIAS', 'IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT', 'COMMUNICATION ENGAGEMENT', 'DISCURSIVE LEGITIMATION', 'PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT', 'NETWORKING SITES', 'MESSAGE SOURCE', 'LANGUAGE USE', 'CEOS USE']","['social media engagement', 'social media engagement', 'social media engagement', 'strategic leaders', 'strategic leaders']",social media online communities
"If service quality relates to retention of customers at the aggregate level, as other research has indicated, then evidence of its impact on customers' behavioral responses should be detectable. The authors offer a conceptual model of the impact of service quality on particular behaviors that signal whether customers remain with or defect from a company. Results from a multicompany empirical study examining relationships from the model concerning customers' behavioral intentions show strong evidence of their being influenced by service quality. The findings also reveal differences in the nature of the quality-intentions link across different dimensions of behavioral intentions.

"Compared to the extensive research that has investigated the structures of social relationships (i.e., social networks), relatively little research attention has been geared towards understanding how and why individuals initiate, build, and maintain social networks (i.e., networking) from a psychological perspective. The objective of this review is to shed light on the dynamic, psychological processes at the center of individuals' discretionary, professional relationship development. The diffuse networking literature in the field of management is reviewed and organized into four primary research streams. On the basis of insights from this review, we propose a dynamic, psychological model of how and why individuals strategically network, which marries social exchange and expectancy theories with the concept of relational schema to explain the networking phenomenon across dyadic and intraindividual levels. This conceptual model posits that a networking interaction, construed as an exchange of resources within a given network relationship at a certain stage of relationship maturity, affects the relational schemas of those involved in the interaction and that each networking partner's relational schema influences each partner's perceptions of his or her network relationship and guides individual decisions to network with a specific network contact. The aim of this review is to lay a theoretical foundation for investigating strategic networking from a dynamic, psychological perspective.","['networking', 'social exchange theory', 'social capital', 'interpersonal resources', 'strategic network relationship development', 'relational schemaLEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'CAREER SUCCESS', 'JOB SEARCH', 'RESOURCE EXCHANGES', 'INFLUENCE TACTICS', 'PROACTIVE CAREER', 'SOCIAL-EXCHANGE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGERIAL']","['networking', 'social exchange', 'social exchange']",networks
"Organizational improvisation is increasingly recognized as a relevant area of management research. However, the cumulativeness of research on improvisation in organizations remains low. This paper organizes existing contributions on organizational improvisation within a new consolidating framework combining degrees (minor, bounded and structural) and levels (individual, interpersonal and organizational) of improvisation. The proposed degree/level framework allows for reviewing the existing literature on organizational improvisation in the management disciplines of strategy, organizational behaviour, organizational theory, innovation and marketing in a systematic manner. It also exposes potential areas for future research across management disciplines, research areas, organizational settings and industries, and beyond existing metaphors, most notably of jazz and improvisational theatre.","['nanJAZZ IMPROVISATION', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'MINIMAL STRUCTURES', 'BASIC PREMISES', 'DESIGN SCHOOL', 'MANAGEMENT', 'INNOVATION', 'METAPHOR', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGIES']","['management', 'innovation', 'metaphor']",
"Privacy in the workplace is a pivotal concern for employees and employers. Employees expect to be in control of the personal information and access they provide to the organization. Employers, however, expect extensive information regarding their employees as well as extensive access to employees' presence. The chasm between these two often competing expectations has been magnified by regulatory and technological trends. We begin the review by integrating viewpoints from multiple disciplines to disentangle definitions of privacy and to delineate the privacy contexts of information privacy and work environment privacy. We then identify the key stakeholders of privacy in the workplace and describe their interests. This discussion serves as a platform for our stakeholders' privacy calculus model, which in turn provides a framework within which we review empirical findings on workplace privacy from organizational research and related disciplines and from which we identify gaps in the existing research. We then advance an extensive research agenda. Finally, we draw attention to emerging technologies and laws that have far-reaching implications for employees and employers. Our review provides a road map for researchers and practitioners to navigate the contested terrain of workplace privacy.","['technology', 'individual decision-making', 'information systems', 'employee rights', 'information processingINFORMATION-PRIVACY', 'EMPLOYEE PERCEPTIONS', 'APPLICANT REACTIONS', 'BIG DATA', 'PHYSICAL-ENVIRONMENT', 'SELECTION PROCEDURES', 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE', 'SPATIAL DENSITY', 'SOCIAL ISSUE', 'WORKPLACE']",['workplace'],privacy
"This article proposes a managerial decision framework to deal with internationalization whether in stable or dynamic environments. While displaying the effects of unstable and stable environmental settings on commitment decisions, the framework is the result of an inferential abductive approach that merges the risk management model with empirical data collected from a 32-year longitudinal case study on nine Swedish MNCs. The longitudinal analysis shows that when environmental changes are perceived as detrimental, firms tend to decrease their tangible assets and commit in a more intangible way. On the opposite, when changes to the environment are perceived as beneficial, firms follow an incremental path of commitment, preferably in tangible kind. The findings contribute new knowledge to understand such diversities in commitment decisions as divestment, wait-and-see, market-exit and re-entry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"Researchers and potential investors in transition economies need to understand the Human Resource Management (HRM) strategies of target firms, since human resources are arguably their most valuable assets. Understanding is difficult, however, because HRM strategies help to determine firms' performance, but are in turn influenced by corporate governance, particularly insider ownership. This paper employs a structural equation modeling methodology to examine the relations between governance, HRM strategies and performance in the context of a novel dataset of Ukrainian industrial firms. It is found that insider ownership is positively associated with high-commitment HRM strategies and negatively with low-commitment, cost-cutting HRM strategies. Cost-cutting HRM strategies are in turn associated with weaker firm performance. These outcomes correspond broadly with theoretical expectations.","['transition', 'HRM strategies', 'performanceCORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES', 'MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'PRIVATIZATION', 'IMPACT', 'DETERMINANTS', 'RUSSIA', 'WORK']","['transition', 'hrm strategies', 'hrm strategies', 'firm performance', 'firm performance']",hrm corporate governance ownership

"Foreign direct investment (FDI) through multinational enterprises (MNEs) has emerged in the last decade as the principal source of foreign capital for developing countries. Meyer (this issue) underlines the need for international business (IB) scholars to understand the impact of these investments on host developing countries. He offers a useful assessment of the literature and proposes a rich set of questions for further research. However, his research agenda can be extended and enriched in two ways. First, IB scholars must study, as they always have, causation in the opposite direction-namely, the impact of developing country context on MNE behavior and the co-evolution of these two variables over time. In doing so, they must incorporate into their models contemporary issues, such as the continued inadequacy of rules for FDI in infrastructure sectors, or the clever means by which MNEs are rewriting the global rules under which they operate in developing countries (e.g., on intellectual property rights). Second, IB scholars must pay more attention to topics that are not mainstream within the field but are of great importance to developing countries. Examples include the behavior and performance of a new generation of home-grown MNEs, the role of diaspora in homeland FDI (in countries like China and India), and the implications of global outsourcing of services.","['MNE-host country relations', 'MNEs and economic development', 'regulating MNEs', 'third-world MNEs', 'outsourcing', 'diasporaMULTINATIONALS', 'PRIVATIZATION', 'INVESTMENT', 'MODEL']","['outsourcing', 'investment', 'model']",foreign direct investment fdi multinational enterprises impact intellectual property rights
"Loyalty programs offer rewards via mediums of different magnitudes (e.g., $6 off when you accumulate 1,000 [100] points. Earn 10 [1] points/dollar). The program medium presents two key pieces of information: reward distance (points required to redeem reward) and step size (points earned per dollar). In higher-magnitude (vs. lower-magnitude) programs, both reward distances (1,000 vs. 100) and step sizes (10 vs. 1 point[s]/dollar) are larger. How do these two pieces of information affect consumers' postenrollment inferences of progress, store loyalty, and recommendation likelihood? Do consumers always integrate both pieces? We identify a moderator, step-size ambiguity, and show that when ambiguity is high, only reward distance affects inferences. When ambiguity is lower, consumers integrate step size with reward distance, but in a biased manner. Implications arise in goal following and in physical and psychological distance estimation contexts (e.g., weight loss, savings) where distances and step sizes can vary (e.g., as a function of units: kilograms vs. pounds), but especially in loyalty rewards contexts.","['nanPRICE CLAIMS', 'INFORMATION', 'EXPERIENCE', 'TENSILE']",['information'],loyalty loyalty
"The current research investigates the role of fear in the creation of emotional attachment to a brand. Previous research examining the influence of incidental negative emotions on brand evaluations has generally found that negative emotions lead to negative evaluations. The current research suggests that for fear, the relationship may be more positive. Since people cope with fear through affiliation with others, in the absence of other individuals, consumers may seek affiliation with an available brand. This, in turn, will enhance emotional attachment to that brand. Four studies demonstrate that consumers who experience fear in the presence of a brand feel greater emotional brand attachment than consumers who experience other emotions such as happiness, sadness, or excitement. The findings from the research advance understanding of consumer-brand relationships by demonstrating that relationships between consumers and brands are not merely metaphorical. Rather, under certain circumstances, brands can actually fulfill interpersonal psychological needs.","['nanPROTECTION MOTIVATION', 'MOOD MANAGEMENT', 'APPEALS', 'ATTITUDE', 'STRESS', 'CONSUMERS', 'ANXIETY', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'CONSUMPTION', 'COGNITION']",['consumers'],

"This article investigates whether bribery in emerging economies matters and whether such bribery has a diminishing return to performance. Bribery allows entrepreneurs to develop and foster a network of informal relationships with public officials, and reap the accompanying benefits; but it may also have disadvantages, such as an inefficient allocation of resources. The relationship between bribery and performance was estimated using unique data derived from a survey of 606 Vietnamese entrepreneurs. We controlled for various entrepreneurial, organizational, and industrial characteristics. The exploratory results provide support for a hill-shaped non-monotonic relationship between bribery and revenues.","['nanFIRM PERFORMANCE', 'SOCIAL-STRUCTURE', 'CORRUPTION', 'TRANSITION', 'GROWTH', 'TRUST', 'COMPETITION', 'OWNERSHIP', 'ECONOMIES', 'STRATEGY']",['economies'],performance
"Knowledge-based businesses (KBBs) are vital to economic development and revitalization in many regions, especially in areas that have experienced a decline in traditional industries. While much attention has been devoted to various aspects of traditional small firm financing, there is a paucity of empirical research to explain how new knowledge-based firms are externally financed. The cur-rent study researches institutional strategies, structures and risk assessment practices of chartered banks and government agencies in a peripheral region of Canada. It examines the extent to which these institutions have modified traditional lending approaches and practices to meet the needs of knowledge-based firms. The study explores the existence of institutional lending cultures through an empirical investigation of risk assessment practices employed by account managers. Two business proposals, one for a knowledge-based firm and one for a more traditional firm, were presented to account managers in chartered banks and government agencies for initial review and subsequent due diligence and risk assessment. Verbal protocols and interview data obtained at three stages of the due diligence process were analyzed using standard multivariate techniques and consensus analysis (CA). CA, a tool developed to measure cultural agreement in cognitive anthropology, was employed to assess the level of agreement among lenders with respect to risk assessment. Overall, the study findings confirm that specialized strategies, structures and processes for lending to KBBs are only partially developed, are still evolving and are considerably diverse in both the banking and government sectors. Furthermore, the level of agreement among lenders develops during the course of the due diligence process. Results confirm consensus and the existence of a lending culture sensitive to the needs of KBBs among a select but important subgroup, knowledge-based lending specialists. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for researchers, entrepreneurs in search of capital and policy makers seeking to develop new business opportunities for regional economic development.

"Firms invest billions of dollars in sales technologies (STs; e.g., customer relationship management, sales automation tools) to improve sales force effectiveness and efficiency. However, the results expected from ST investments are often not achieved. This article proposes relationship-forging tasks that are critical to the link between ST use and key aspects of salesperson performance (i.e., a salesperson's relationship-building performance with customers and administrative performance). The authors evaluate relationship-forging tasks in the context of a model that considers the antecedents and consequences of three different uses of ST: accessing, analyzing, and communicating information. In general, the results of a field study, which is analyzed using block-recursive structural equation modeling, support the relationship-forging theory and show that relationship-forging tasks predict 57% of the variance in a salesperson's relationship-building performance with customers. The findings also support hypotheses that using ST either to analyze or to communicate information has mediated positive effects on a salesperson's relationship-building performance with customers. However, a salesperson's use of ST to analyze information has negative influences on administrative performance, creating an unexpected trade-off for sales and marketing managers.","['nanBUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS', 'CONTROL-SYSTEMS', 'INDUSTRIAL SALESPERSONS', 'INFORMATION-SYSTEMS', 'MARKET-INFORMATION', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'JOB-SATISFACTION', 'USER EVALUATIONS', 'SUPPLY CHAIN', 'MODEL']",['model'],relationship forging performance model information
"Organizations capable of pursuing exploration and exploitation simultaneously have been suggested to obtain superior performance. Combining both types of activities and achieving organizational ambidexterity, however, leads to the presence of multiple and often conflicting goals, and poses considerable challenges to senior teams in ambidextrous organizations. This study explores the role of senior team attributes and leadership behaviour in reconciling conflicting interests among senior team members and achieving organizational ambidexterity. Findings indicate that a senior team shared vision and contingency rewards are associated with a firm's ability to combine high levels of exploratory and exploitative innovations. In addition, our study shows that an executive director's transformational leadership increases the effectiveness of senior team attributes in ambidextrous organizations and moderates the effectiveness of senior team social integration and contingency rewards. Hence, our study clarifies how senior executives reconcile conflicting demands and facilitate the balancing of seemingly contradictory forces in ambidextrous organizations.

Drawing from the knowledge-based view, we investigate which firms benefit most from agglomeration and discuss how the implications for entrepreneurs are significant if some firms benefit more from geographic agglomeration than others. We investigate three particular firm attributes that may accentuate or mitigate benefits tied to participation in a cluster. We test our hypotheses on a sample of biotechnology firms and find strong evidence that firms benefit asymmetrically.

"We examine interpersonal congruence, the degree to which group members see others in the group as others see themselves, as a moderator of the relationship between diversity and group effectiveness. A longitudinal study of 83 work groups revealed that diversity tended to improve creative task performance in groups with high interpersonal congruence, whereas diversity undermined the performance of groups with low interpersonal congruence. This interaction effect also emerged on measures of social integration, group identification, and relationship conflict. By eliciting self-verifying appraisals, members of some groups achieved enough interpersonal congruence during their first ten minutes of interaction to benefit their group outcomes four months later. In contrast to theories of social categorization, the interpersonal congruence approach suggests that group members can achieve harmonious and effective work processes by expressing rather than suppressing the characteristics that make them unique.","['nanRELATIONAL DEMOGRAPHY', 'IDENTITY NEGOTIATION', 'SOCIAL INTEGRATION', 'DIFFERENCE', 'CONFLICT', 'BEHAVIOR', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONSENSUS', 'COMMITMENT']","['social integration', 'social integration', 'conflict', 'performance']",identification

Specifically, this paper: (1) clarifies the nature of the relationship between entrepreneurial expert scripts and constructs that might represent an entrepreneurial mindset at the individual level of analysis; (2) identifies analogous relationships at the economy level of analysis, where the structure found at the individual level informs an economy-level problem; (3) presents a North American Free Trade Agreement-based illustration analysis to demonstrate the extent to which cognitive findings at the individual level can be used to explain economy-level phenomena; and (4) extrapolates from our analysis some of the ways in which script-based comparisons across country or culture can inform the more general task of making information processing-based comparisons among entrepreneurs across other contexts.","['nanVALUE CREATION', 'VALUE CAPTURE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'EXPRESSION', 'CHALLENGES', 'EXPERIENCE', 'CONSTRUCT', 'DECISION', 'SINKING']",['construct'],
Three experiments demonstrate that people incorporate more variety into their consumption decisions when their behavior is subject to public scrutiny. Studies 1 and 2 indicate that consumers expect others to evaluate their decision more favorably if they choose variety and that this sometimes leads individuals to incorporate more variety into their public than private decisions. Results of study 2 confirm predictions that a relevant individual difference variable (self-monitoring) moderates the effects of expected evaluation on variety seeking. The final study demonstrates that pressure to choose variety in public is eliminated when a social cue signals the appropriateness of consuming one's favorites.,"['nanINTERPERSONAL INFLUENCE', 'PURCHASE QUANTITY', 'SELF', 'DEINDIVIDUATION', 'QUALITY', 'CHOICE', 'LEVEL']",['self'],behavior

"Purpose - This research aims to explore innovation in supply chain management. Innovation has often been studied in supply chain relationships and specifically from a product point of view. The authors aim to observe innovation by focusing on the different practices and collaborations suppliers and customers are developing to improve their competitiveness and the performance of the whole supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - A review of previous literature on innovation in supply chain management is presented and the authors design an interview guide for their data collection that is developed from their previous literature review on innovation in supply chain management. Data are collected from 68 innovations in French companies and subsequently analyzed to identify the major elements of innovations in supply chain management. Findings - The key findings of the paper identify the major components affecting innovative supply chain practices and SC performance. The results suggest that innovation is essential in supply chain management and can be characterized according to its degree of novelty and rupture, its distribution throughout the SC and the level at which it occurs. In addition, a typology of innovative supply chain practices is proposed.

"Loss aversion is a behavioral phenomenon with game-changing implications for economic theory and practice. We conduct a meta-analysis of 33 studies (providing 109 observations) investigating loss aversion in random utility models of brand choice. Specifically, we use multilevel modeling techniques to examine potential moderators of preference asymmetries as well as the variability of loss-aversion effects within and between studies. We find that loss aversion is manifest in product choice, but that it exhibits substantial variation across research contexts. Product-related variables (e.g., the category type), consumer characteristics (e.g., reference-point mechanisms), and particularly methodological decisions (e.g., model specifications) determine the observed degree of loss gain disparity. Practical implications of the specific findings and opportunities for future research are discussed. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Marketing academics and practitioners alike remain unconvinced about the chief marketing officer's (CMO's) performance implications. Whereas some studies propose that firms benefit financially from having a CMO in the C-suite, other studies conclude that the CMO has little or no effect on firm performance. Accordingly, there have been strong calls for additional academic research regarding the CMO's performance implications. In response to these calls, the authors employ model specifications with varying identifying assumptions (i.e., rich data models, unobserved effects models, instrumental variable models, and panel internal instruments models) and use data from up to 155 publicly traded firms over a 12-year period (2000-2011) to find that firms can indeed expect to benefit financially from having a CMO at the strategy table. Specifically, their findings suggest that the performance (measured in terms of Tobin's q) of the sample firms that employ a CMO is, on average, approximately 15% greater than that of the sample firms that do not employ a CMO. This result is robust to the type of model specification used. Marketing academics and practitioners should find the results intriguing given the existing uncertainty surrounding the CMO's performance implications. The study also contributes to the methodology literature by collating diverse empirical model specifications that can be used to model causal effects with observational data into a coherent and comprehensive framework.","['chief marketing officer performance implications', 'marketing-finance interface', 'panel data', 'endogeneity', 'instrumental variableRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'SHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'DYNAMIC-MODELS', 'PANEL-DATA', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FIRM', 'VALUATION', 'RISK', 'ORIENTATION']","['performance', 'firm']",chief officer cmo firm performance model
"The ability to maintain internally developed technology over time is important for corporate vitality. We label this ability transformative capacity and suggest that it depends on how well a firm accomplishes three tasks, These tasks are: the choice of technologies, their maintenance over time, and their reactivation and synthesis when required. To establish the need for transformative capacity, we first discuss time lags in the development of technologies and markets to suggest that not all technologies developed by firms can be utilized immediately. We then examine dimensions of technological knowledge that affect knowledge transfer over time. Next, we build on the resource-based view of the firm to discuss how firms can create transformative capacity. The concluding discussion focuses on the implications of transformative capacity for the analysis and management of technological investments as a way to maintain corporate vitality.","['TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER', 'INNOVATION', 'CHANGE', 'RESTRUCTURING', 'RESOURCE-BASED-VIEWCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'TECHNICAL CHANGE', 'RISK-TAKING', 'INNOVATION', 'FIRM', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'ECONOMICS']",['firm'],technology firm
"Recent studies on the antecedents of industrial crises have tended to focus on disasters in high-risk systems involving complex technologies and tightly-knit processes. This paper examines events leading up to mining disasters which past research has characterized as being typically more foreseeable and avoidable. We discuss how many mining disasters are likely to be the result of 'mock bureaucracies' or situations characterized by overt violation of safety rules at the workplace. Using the Westray mine explosion as an illustrative case, the paper traces the development and institutionalization of a mock bureaucracy in an organization. Implications for further research and understanding of industrial crises are drawn.","['nanINDUSTRIAL CRISES', 'SENSEMAKING', 'BHOPAL', 'RISK']",['risk'],

In this study, we develop an inductive, process model of the relationships among (1) top managers' beliefs about knowledge as a resource (termed executive knowledge schemes), (2) the ways that executives search or scan for knowledge, and (3) how they use that knowledge in practice to transform common knowledge into distinctive, uncommon knowledge as a way of achieving competitive advantage. In the course of generating the grounded model, we also uncovered a new concept, scanning proactiveness, and identified two distinct forms of knowledge use in practice: knowledge adaptation and knowledge augmentation.","['nanABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'MANAGERIAL', 'COGNITION', 'VIEW', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'EXPLORATION', 'SENSEMAKING']",['view'],view strategy competitive advantage model

This study argues that these conflicting findings are due to the limitation of underlying research methods. This study employs a mixed method design that incorporates qualitative data, social network analysis, and multilevel modeling to categorize family businesses into three distinct boundary strength categories. Findings from this study suggest that extremes in boundary strengths provide unique challenges for family businesses.

"While strategy scholars primarily focus on internal firm capabilities and network, scholars typically examine network structure, we posit that firms with superior network structures may, be better able to exploit their internal capabilities and thus enhance their performance. We examine how innovative capabilities-both those of focal firms and those they access through their networks-influence the performance of Canadian mutual fund companies. We find that a firm's innovative capabilities and its network structure both enhance firm performance, while the innovativeness of its contacts does not do so directly. Innovative firms that also bridge structural holes get a further performance boost, suggesting that firms need to develop network-enabled capabilities-capabilities accruing to innovative firms that bridge structural holes.

"Globalization has substantially influenced the world economy. However, managers have a limited understanding of how local-global identity influences consumers' price perceptions and behavior. In this research, the authors propose that consumers' local (vs. global) identity leads to a greater tendency to make price-perceived quality (PPQ) associations. Perceived quality variance among comparison brands is a key mechanism underlying these effects. Two field studies (Studies 1 and 7), seven experiments (Studies 2-6, 9, and 10), and a systematic review of secondary data (Study 8) provide converging and robust evidence for the effect of local-global identity on PPQ. Consistent with the perceived quality variance account, when quality differences among the brands are made salient, PPQ associations of consumers high in global (but not local) identity significantly increase, compared with baseline conditions. However, when perceived quality similarities are made salient, PPQ associations of consumers high in local (but not global) identity significantly decrease. Product type and distribution of customer ratings represent natural boundaries for the relationship between local-global identity and PPQ. The authors conclude with the implications for managers' targeting endeavors. We also provide specific tools that marketers can use in ads and point-of-purchase materials to encourage or discourage consumers in making PPQ associations.","['local-global identity', 'perceived quality variance', 'price-perceived qualityORIENTATION', 'CULTURE', 'IMPACT', 'OTHERS']","['local global identity', 'local global identity', 'local global identity', 'perceived quality variance', 'perceived quality variance', 'perceived quality variance']",perceptions perceived quality perceived variance brands
"Understanding consumer decision making about what to eat is both complex, as multiple factors can drive food choice, and important, as food choice impacts overall health. This research examines an intuition at the crossroads of two important criteria for food decision making-healthiness and price-finding that consumers believe that healthier food is more expensive than less healthy food. While this relationship may be accurate in some cases, consumers overgeneralize this belief to contexts and product categories where it is not objectively true. As a result, the healthy = expensive intuition influences consumer decision making by impacting inferences of missing attributes and choice between alternatives. Further, consistent with dual process models, the intuition acts as a bias in shaping how consumers process information about health and price when consumers are processing heuristically, including altering both perceptions of how  healthy a given ingredient is as a function of product price and the amount of information search consumers engage in when evaluating health claims, such that consumers have a higher standard of evidence when evaluating intuition-inconsistent claims. Overall, the healthy = expensive intuition has a powerful influence on consumer decision making, with significant implications for both consumers and marketers.","['healthiness', 'food decision making', 'price', 'intuition', 'lay theory', 'dual process modelsNUTRITION INFORMATION', 'TASTY INTUITION', 'SELF-REGULATION', 'FOOD', 'CONSUMERS', 'CLAIMS', 'RESTAURANT', 'UNHEALTHY', 'SEARCH', 'CHOICE']","['healthiness', 'food decision making', 'food decision making', 'food decision making', 'price', 'intuition', 'food', 'consumers', 'claims', 'search', 'choice']",consumer choice impacts health healthiness price inferences models
"Four theoretical perspectives currently dominate attempts to understand the drivers of successful interorganizational relationship performance: (1) commitment-trust, (2) dependence, (3) transaction cost economics, and (4) relational norms. Each perspective specifies a different set and distinct causal ordering of focal constructs as the most critical for understanding performance. Using four years of longitudinal data (N = 396), the authors compare the relative efficacy of these four perspectives for driving exchange performance and provide empirical insights into the causal ordering among key interorganizational constructs. The results demonstrate the parallel and equally important roles of commitment-trust and relationship-specific investments as immediate precursors to and key drivers of exchange performance. Building on the insights gleaned from tests of the four frameworks, the authors parsimoniously integrate these perspectives within a single model of interfirm relationship performance consistent with a resource-based view of an exchange. Managers may be able to increase performance by shifting resources from relationship building to specific investments targeted toward increasing the efficacy or effectiveness of the relationship itself to improve the relationship's ability to create value. Moderation analysis indicates that managers may find it productive to allocate more relationship marketing efforts and investments to exchanges in markets with higher levels of uncertainty.","['nanINTERFIRM RELATIONSHIPS', 'SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS', 'EMPIRICAL-TEST', 'JOINT ACTION', 'COMMITMENT', 'TRUST', 'DETERMINANTS', 'INVESTMENTS', 'CHANNELS', 'NORMS']","['commitment', 'trust', 'investments', 'norms']",performance commitment trust
"Employees' prosocial values have been shown to foster helping, cooperating, and volunteering behaviors, which in turn increase firm performance. However, despite the importance of prosocial values, there is a general neglect of this area in the international arena. As more trade occurs globally, interest in cross-cultural prosocial values is growing. We therefore build on socialization theory and introduce national business ideology as a country-level determinant of employees' prosocial values. We thus argue that transformational leadership and professional altruism are key elements of a national business ideology's stimulation of employees' prosocial values, while corporate corruption is considered to be an impediment. Based on 19,026 individuals from 17 countries, our cross-level analyses point to the national business ideology explaining national-level variances above and beyond cultural aspects. Results support our hypothesis that national business ideology, including transformational leadership and professional altruism, is positively related to employees' prosocial values. The hypothesis on corporate corruption, however, was not supported. Instead, results indicate that employees apply rationalization strategies to justify corruption. With prosocial values being important for organizational performance as well as social welfare in general, we thus draw attention to socialization processes in national corporate work contexts.

"Property rights economics furthers the resource-based view of strategic management in a number of ways. First, resources are conceptualized as being composed of multiple attributes for which property rights may be held. Second, a resource owner's ability, to create, appropriate, and sustain value from resources depends on the property rights that he or she holds and on the transaction costs of exchanging, defining, and protecting them. While transaction costs are a major source of value dissipation, reducing such dissipation may create value. Implications for the RBV analysis of sustained competitive advantage are derived.

This article presents a dynamic utility-maximizing model of career choice between self-employment and employment that takes into consideration the differences among people in terms of their initial attitudes toward job attributes and the likely changes to those attitudes as they mature. These differences between people affect the choice of career that maximizes their utility (there are at least five optimal career paths). This dynamic utility-maximizing model helps increase our understanding not only of why some people become self-employed but also of why and when some self-employed people switch to employment.

Finally, our simulations highlight how stronger instruments improve statistical power and that endogenous instruments can report results that are inferior to those reported by OLS regression.

"Entrepreneurship research on prosocial motivation has outlined its positive impact on well-being, but still little is known about its power, which may have deleterious personal consequences under certain conditions. In this study, we ask whether prosocial motivation can harm entrepreneurs' subjective well-being when they run a commercial venture. Embedded within a contingency perspective informed by self-determination theory, we build on longitudinal survey data to explain the effect of prosocial motivation on entrepreneurs' overall life satisfaction. Our analysis demonstrates that prosocial motivation has a negative effect on entrepreneurs' life satisfaction due to increased levels of stress. However, our findings show that the negative effect of prosocial motivation dissipates when perceived autonomy at work is high compared to when it is low. Overall, our research raises questions on the role of prosocial motivation for entrepreneurs' subjective well-being and, in particular, discusses its potential dark side in the context of commercial entrepreneurship. Executive summary: Can there be a dark side in helping others? If so, how can we better understand under what conditions it emerges? Entrepreneurship research conventionally presents prosocial motivation as a positive driver for social venture creation and entrepreneurs' well-being. However, we have little knowledge about the consequences of prosocial motivation when we move outside the social entrepreneurship context. When prosocially motivated entrepreneurs lead a commercial venture, they face the difficult task of balancing the desire to help others with the financial requirements of the business. The challenge of simultaneously accomplishing commercial and prosocial goals can result in a stressful experience that is detrimental to the entrepreneur's well-being. In this study, we ask whether and under what circumstances prosocial motivation can harm entrepreneurs' well-being. Embedded in a contingency perspective informed by self-determination theory, this article expands our knowledge on the effects of prosocial motivation in the context of commercial entrepreneurship. We draw from original longitudinal survey data on 186 entrepreneurs in the United Kingdom to demonstrate that prosocial motivation causes entrepreneurs stress and through that stress has a negative effect on their life satisfaction. We also show that the negative effect of prosocial motivation diminishes when the degree of autonomy entrepreneurs perceive in the pursuit of daily work tasks is high. To explore the uniqueness of the entrepreneurial context, we run a comparative analysis with a sample of 544 employees. This analysis confirms that stress fully mediates the negative relationship between prosocial motivation and subjective well-being, but for employees, this negative effect disappears when their level of intrinsic motivation-the desire to expend effort based on enjoyment of the work itself-is high. Building on our findings, we generate several important contributions. First, we help develop an understanding of the dark side of prosocial motivation by demonstrating that under certain circumstances, the desire to help others can be detrimental to entrepreneurs' subjective well-being. Second, we expand knowledge about the link between prosocial motivation and well-being by considering the boundary conditions (perceived autonomy and intrinsic motivation) that influence the dynamics of their relationship. Third, we set the stage for further investigations that aim to clarify the relationship between motivation and perceived autonomy and its effect on personal outcomes across different work domains. The key insight of the study is that prosocial motivation creates a dilemma for entrepreneurs when operating a commercial business such that the desire to help others outside the context of immediate work tasks can harm their personal well-being. We also find that the perception of autonomy is key for commercial entrepreneurs to be able to realize their prosocial motivation without creating stressful situations. Extending our understanding of the conditions that shape the relationship between prosocial motivation and well-being among entrepreneurs would help in developing a more holistic notion of prosocial business venturing, one that includes the role of both commercial and social enterprising activities in contributing to personal and societal well-being.","['Entrepreneurship', 'prosocial motivation', 'subjective well-beingSELF-DETERMINATION THEORY', 'INTRINSIC MOTIVATION', 'CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'WORK', 'SATISFACTION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'COMPASSION']","['entrepreneurship', 'prosocial motivation', 'prosocial motivation', 'intrinsic motivation', 'intrinsic motivation', 'work', 'satisfaction', 'perspective']",well being subjective well being self determination theory well commercial entrepreneurship

"This research examines the relationship between growth intentions, cognitive style, and perceived competitive conditions, with a focus on whether and why intentions change over time. Drawing on qualitative data from a sample of 30 entrepreneurs over a five-year span, we find that entrepreneurs' cognitive style moderates the relationship between perceptions of the competitive environment and growth intentions. Entrepreneurs with differing cognitive styles vary in their approaches toward formulating and revising growth intentions. Relative to analytic entrepreneurs that exhibit greater stability in their intentions, holistic entrepreneurs are prone to greater variations in growth intentions. The findings have implications for future research, practice, public policy, and entrepreneurship training and development. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

"Much of the rising international connectedness of city-regions has developed from MNEs replacing local connections with (superior) international ones. This often creates local disconnectedness that energizes the current populist backlash against MNE activities. We develop approaches to new IB theory, addressing the interdependencies of MNEs and city-regions that we propose as a crucial avenue for future research. We contrast two generic MNE strategies. The first is the traditional one: the 'global orchestration' of resources and markets. We argue that it exacerbates local disconnectedness. The second, that we call 'local spawning,' involves engaging with the local entrepreneurial eco-system to create and renew local connectedness, diffusing populist responses. Some MNEs are better able to implement a local spawning strategy, due to industry factors like innovation clock-speed, and firm characteristics like organizational path dependency. Finally, we distinguish between disconnection, which is an outcome of MNE strategy, and global disruptions, like the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which are primarily stochastic events. Addressing disconnections requires MNEs to re-orient their strategies while dealing with disruptions requires undertaking risk mitigation. We present empirical evidence from city-regions around the world to illustrate our theory.","['MNE strategy', 'global cities', 'city-regions', 'disruption', 'global value chains', 'off shoring', 'MNE geography', 'knowledge transferRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'LOCATION CHOICE', 'GLOBAL CITIES', 'MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISES', 'INDUSTRIAL CLUSTERS', 'ECONOMIC-GEOGRAPHY', 'KNOWLEDGE FLOWS', 'INNOVATION', 'GLOBALIZATION', 'CONNECTIVITY']","['mne strategy', 'mne strategy', 'city regions', 'city regions', 'disruption', 'innovation']",disruptions
"Empirical studies provide an inconsistent picture of the relationship between an innovative personality predisposition (i.e., innate consumer innovativeness [ICI]) and innovative behavior (i.e., new product adoption behavior). Such inconsistencies suggest intervening variables that may mediate the relationship have not been considered. Using data from a panel of consumers (n=296 in a cross-sectional phase, n=147 in a matched, two-phase longitudinal analysis), we find that ICI does not directly influence adoption behavior but does so indirectly through two of three components of vicarious innovativeness (modeling and engagement in word of mouth but not exposure to advertising). Furthermore, despite the evidence that consumers' decision processes differ for service versus product adoption, extant studies largely ignore the role of ICI in new service adoption. Our findings suggest that vicarious innovativeness plays a similar intervening role in service contexts. Finally, divergent operationalizations of adoption behavior (ownership, relative time of adoption) appear to perform equally well.","['consumer innovativeness', 'new product and service adoption behavior', 'word of mouth', 'advertising', 'latent variable modelsWORD-OF-MOUTH', 'INFORMATION', 'PERSONALITY', 'INNOVATORS', 'ADAPTION']","['consumer innovativeness', 'consumer innovativeness', 'word of mouth', 'word of mouth', 'word of mouth', 'advertising', 'personality']",consumer innovativeness new product adoption modeling advertising
"Firms striving for long-term profitability need to build stronger customer-firm relationships by getting their customers more engaged with the firm. One path to this end is introducing practices to manage different forms of customer engagement behaviors (CEBs). To develop more effective and efficient CEB management practices, this research proposes and empirically tests a theoretical model on managerial and psychological processes to encourage CEBs that are embedded in a broader network of customers and stakeholders. Based on qualitative and quantitative studies in nursing homes, we demonstrate that organizational support and overall service quality toward significant others influence some forms of CEBsmore particularly feedback and positive word of mouth (WOM) behaviorsthrough customer affect toward the organization. It is interesting to note that customer affect toward the organization encourages WOM behaviors, while it discourages feedback behaviors. Conversely, managerial processes that increase customer role readinesssuch as organizational socialization and support from other customerswere found to have a positive impact on all forms of CEBs. This research helps managers of nursing homes and other services with a broad network of customers and stakeholders to improve existing CEB management practices and develop new CEB management practices that are beneficial for the firm and its stakeholders.","['customer engagement behaviors', 'organizational socialization', 'organizational support', 'role theory', 'social exchange theoryLONG-TERM-CARE', 'CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIORS', 'HIERARCHICAL MODEL', 'FAMILY CAREGIVERS', 'PARTIAL EMPLOYEES', 'SCALE DEVELOPMENT', 'SERVICE QUALITY', 'PARTICIPATION', 'COLLABORATION', 'FRAMEWORK']","['customer engagement behaviors', 'customer engagement behaviors', 'customer engagement behaviors', 'organizational socialization', 'organizational socialization', 'organizational support', 'organizational support', 'service quality', 'service quality']",customer engagement behaviors ceb support quality impact

Its purpose, is to develop different language strategies relying on theoretical insights borrowed from translation studies. Inspired by historical developments in this discipline, we identify three metaphorical perspectives each with a different conception of translation and language. These perspectives are the theoretical basis on which we develop three language strategies: a mechanical, cultural and political language strategy. For each strategy, we discuss the selection of language(s), the role of translators and the validation method, and formulate proposition about the types of texts being produced. These propositions indicate that, through their international communication process, international companies become scripted as a particular type of multilingual organization, be it a uniform, a culturally specific or a hybrid text.

"Four experiments investigate consumers' moral judgments of a firm's brand reputation when given information about an employee's non-workplace transgression. To the extent that the employee is perceived to have power in the firm (i.e., control over resources and decisions), the employee's offensive action damages the firm's reputation and decreases consumers' purchase intentions. These effects occur even though the action occurs in the employee's private life and is unrelated to product quality. The results replicate for three types of products and three types of offenses. The employee's perceived power in the firm provides the most consistent explanation of customers' negative responses and is a better predictor than the alternative explanations tested (e.g., perceived status). Results also show that after an offense comes to light, firm reactions that decrease or eliminate the employee's power in the organization-such as reducing decision-making responsibilities or firing the employee-can help restore the firm's reputation.","['Moral judgment', 'Scandal', 'Power', 'Status', 'BrandingCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'PRODUCT RESPONSES', 'ASSOCIATIONS', 'IDENTITY', 'IMAGE', 'POWER', 'ENDORSEMENT', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'INFERENCES', 'COMPANY']","['moral judgment', 'moral judgment', 'power', 'status', 'power']",power
"In many industries, firms introduce successive generations of new and enhanced product models to remain competitive. Product enhancements target first-time purchasers and consumers who already own an existing product and are considering upgrading to a new and enhanced product. Upgrade decisions differ from new purchase decisions because they are hindered by the psychological costs associated with the purchase price spent on the existing product. This research examines how the enhanced product can be positioned relative to the existing product to mitigate the psychological costs and facilitate upgrade purchases. A series of studies demonstrate that consumers with existing products are more likely to upgrade when the enhanced product is generally dissimilar to the existing product. Upgraders; have stronger preferences than first-time purchasers for enhanced products with new features rather than for improvements on existing features, and they prefer enhancements that focus on a few key features rather than a general enhancement of all features.","['nanSUNK-COST', 'CHOICE', 'SIMILARITY', 'DECISIONS', 'REPRESENTATIONS', 'PSYCHOLOGY', 'ALIGNMENT', 'FEATURES']","['decisions', 'features']",models product enhancements upgrade

"Purpose This paper aims to identify, analyse and organise the literature about blockchains in supply chain management (SCM) context (blockchain-SCM integration) and proposes an agenda for future research. This study aims to shed light on what the main current blockchain applications in SCM are, what the main disruptions and challenges are in SCM because of blockchain adoption and what the future of blockchains holds in SCM. Design/methodology/approach This study followed the systematic review approach to analyse and synthesise the extant literature on blockchain-SCM integration. The review analysed 27 papers between 2008 and 2018 in peer-reviewed journals. Findings Blockchain-SCM integration is still in its infancy. Scholars and practitioners are not fully aware of the potential of blockchain technology to disrupt traditional business models. However, the electric power industry seems to have a relatively mature understanding of blockchain-SCM integration, demonstrated by the use of smart contracts. Additionally, the disintermediation provided by blockchain applications has the potential to disrupt traditional industries (e.g. health care, transportation and retail). Research limitations/implications - The limitations of this study are represented mainly by the scarcity of studies on blockchain-SCM integration in leading journals and databases. Practical implications - This study highlights examples of blockchain-SCM integration, emphasising the need to rethink business models to incorporate blockchain technology. Originality/value This study is the first attempt to synthesise existing publications about the blockchain-SCM integration, shedding light on the disruption caused by, and the necessity of, the SCM reconfigurations.","['New technology', 'Systematic literature review', 'SCM practices', 'Disruption', 'Supply chain disruptionsTECHNOLOGY', 'INTERNET', 'FUTURE', 'INFORMATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'RESILIENCE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'FRAMEWORK', 'SECURITY', 'ROLES']","['disruption', 'future']",blockchains supply chain management design industry
"Advocates of the market for corporate control argue that takeover bids should be accepted because unsuccessful targets tend to lose market value. Other researchers argue that takeover bids should be rejected because the combined firms often perform poorly. However, missing in this debate is the influence of the source of takeover gains on the decision to reject or accept takeover bids. This study posits that value from takeovers can be created by synergy or restructuring. The study suggests that only if the synergy component is dominant should the target firm agree to be taken over. The study then tests the dominance of the source of value in takeovers by examining takeovers that were unsuccessful. The study concludes that, first, restructuring, not synergy, motivated the sample studied and target firms can create the same value independently. Second the need for restructuring was industry-wide. However, even if restructuring is the motive behind a takeover, the target firm has to carry out the restructuring, failing which it does not create any value. The study also suggests reasons for the ambiguous findings in the strategic management merger literature.","['TAKEOVERS', 'RESTRUCTURING', 'SYNERGY', 'SHAREHOLDER-WEALTHTENDER OFFERS', 'HORIZONTAL MERGERS', 'CORPORATE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGIES']","['takeovers', 'restructuring', 'synergy', 'corporate']",market corporate control
"In 1954, Drucker boldly declared that organizations have only two basic functions, marketing and innovation. While true for any organization, this insight is particularly pertinent for technology-based businesses. The complicated environment surrounding high-tech companies creates a great need for sophisticated marketing. Yet these companies continue to have under-developed competencies in marketing and in understanding customer needs. This essay explores Drucker's insights with respect to two particularly salient issues for high-tech companies: developing and implementing a market orientation and break-through innovations. We review Drucker's insights and synthesize them with the scholarly research on these issues. Finally, we discuss three emerging areas in high-tech marketing where academics and managers could build on Drucker's insights to guide future research and practice: market driving, customer co-creation, and corporate social responsibility. These illustrative examples highlight that even today, Drucker's writings continue to offer remarkable guidance to scholars and managers who are willing to take the time to reflect, understand, and incorporate his insights in the unique context of high-tech industries.","['High-technology marketing', 'Technology and innovation', 'Marketing of innovation', 'Marketing of technology', 'Drucker', 'Market orientation', 'Proactive market orientation', 'Cross-functional integration', 'Radical innovation', ""Innovator's dilemma"", 'Creative destruction', 'Innovation metrics', 'Market driving', 'Network effects', 'Network externalities', 'Customer co-creation', 'Customer co-innovation', 'Corporate social responsibilityPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'OVERLOOKED ROLE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CAPABILITIES', 'FRAMEWORK', 'SUCCESS', 'CREATIVITY', 'PARADOX', 'CULTURE', 'DRIVEN']","['drucker', 'market orientation', 'market orientation', 'market driving', 'market driving', 'customer co creation', 'customer co creation', 'customer co creation']",innovation market orientation
"This paper examines how dress can be implicated in contests regarding individual and organizational identities. Identities are understood as being constituted within discursive regimes, and to be subjectively available to people in the form of self-narratives. The pluralism and polyphony that characterize organizations means that collective self-narratives are likely to be fractured, contested and multilayered. It is in this context that attire is an important object symbol that conveys information about the individual and collective self Here we focus on aspects of dress, especially the Islamic headscarf, and its role in the dynamics of Collective identity maintenance and challenge in one all-female Turkish university department. Our ethnographic approach yielded multiple, related and sometimes overlapping story lines centred on dress. These we have chosen to represent as a single though multi-voiced faculty narrative in order to facilitate analysis of what was a particularly rich symbolic milieu. The principal research contribution of this paper is as a discussion of participants' clothing in the constitution of individual and organizational narrative identities, and its importance for understanding the dynamics of identity conflicts.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY', 'MUSLIM WOMEN', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'NEGOTIATION', 'NARRATIVES', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'POLITICS', 'STORIES', 'TURKEY', 'IMAGE']",['narratives'],
"The teamworking and knowledge management fields are increasingly converging. Teamworking is turned to with a growing disillusion with knowledge management approaches that are seen as excessively 'hard', 'objectified', or 'information technology dominated'. This paper is a critical review, the purpose of which is to survey the literature across several fields that provide insights into teamworking aspects of knowledge management, and the reverse. This approach is chosen as disciplines tend to sustain presumptions and preoccupations that may be contradicted by other fields, as is shown. In particular, the review challenges what is referred to as the 'organizational behaviour textbook theory of teamworking' and refers to research and theory from several disciplines that qualify what is still an influential orthodoxy. The paper attempts to draw together some principles from current themes such as collective mind, modularity, cross-functional teams and communities of practice.","['nanPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'ORGANIZATION', 'INTEGRATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TEAMS', 'INNOVATION', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'WORK']","['organization', 'teams', 'technology', 'work']",teamworking knowledge collective mind modularity teams
"Disaster events threaten the lives, economies, and wellbeing of those they impact. Understanding the role of emergent organizations in responding to suffering and building resilience is an important component of the grand challenge of how to effectively respond to disasters. In this inductive case study we explore venture creation initiated by locals in response to suffering following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In exploring six ventures we found that two distinctive groups emerged in terms of their identification of potential opportunities to alleviate suffering, their access to and use of key resources, the action they took, and ultimately their effectiveness in facilitating resilience. We offer an inductive, grounded theoretical model that emerged from our data that provides insight into and an extension of literature on resilience to adversity and the disaster literature on emergent response groups, opening pathways for management scholarship to contribute in a meaningful way to this grand challenge.","['nanDISASTER', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'COMMUNITY', 'IDENTITY', 'FIRMS', 'RISK', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'COMPASSIONATE', 'LEGITIMATE', 'ACADEMIA']",['organizations'],disaster organizations earthquake
"A large body of research has pointed out the need for a contingent approach in the design of new product development processes, highlighting the risk of simply accepting a normative perspective that leads to the identification and diffusion of decontextualized best practices.'' In the literature there are contrasting views regarding the identification of the characteristics of product innovation processes in extremely uncertain and dynamic conditions. Some studies propose a fascinating dichotomy: the contraposition between flexible processes and Stage-Gate(R) processes. They maintain that Stage-Gate(R) processes are characterized by early and sharp'' product definition and clear separation between concept development and implementation (detail design and production ramp-up), whereas flexible development models seek to delay the concept freeze point and overlap product development stages going beyond concurrent engineering. Other studies have arrived at seemingly conflicting results; the suitability of the early and sharp product definition approach in turbulent environments is debated without supporting the dichotomy between. exible processes and Stage-Gate(R) processes. Moreover, additional reasons for questioning the contraposition between Stage-Gate(R) and. exible processes come from a series of studies on the management of discontinuous innovation. The aim of the present study was to develop a conceptual framework that can overcome this widely accepted but controversial dichotomy. The framework is based on the recognition of the orthogonality among three analytical dimensions: organizational, informational, and temporal. The organizational dimension refers to the structuration of the process. The informational dimension deals with classifying the development activities and investigating the firm's product definition approach (early and sharp mode vs. late freeze mode). The temporal dimension relates to the execution strategies of development tasks. The three- dimensional framework enables us to better understand the complex relationships between the degree of structuration in process design (organizational dimension), the degree of intersection between problem-formulation and problem-solving in product definition (informational dimension), and different types of execution strategies (temporal dimension).","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'DESIGN STRUCTURE MATRIX', '2ND TOYOTA PARADOX', 'RADICAL INNOVATION', 'DISCONTINUOUS INNOVATION', 'SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT', 'INTERNET TIME', 'INFORMATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PROJECTS']","['discontinuous innovation', 'discontinuous innovation', 'information', 'management']",design models framework
"Despite important advances in recent years, no agreement exists concerning what constitutes management excellence. Specific knowledge of how managerial behaviour is perceived and evaluated by others will help to resolve unsettled questions about what is meant by management excellence and improve the actual decisions of managers. This article examines the determinants of managerial excellence as perceived by corporate CEOs, directors, and financial analysts in Fortune magazine's annual survey of the best-managed American firms in 33 industries. While the firms perceived to be best managed are more profitable and less risky, and grow faster and reward their stockholders more than less well-managed firms, these variables explain only about 30 per cent of the variance in management ratings. The firms perceived to be best managed have more involvement in international markets and research and development, while large firm size and firm diversification reflect negatively upon perceived managerial quality. The relative inability of conventional financial measures of firm performance to explain perceptions of managerial excellence underlines the complex nature both of these perceptions and strategic behaviour. The results support Varadarajan and Ramanujam's conclusion that excellent management depends upon a diverse set of competencies and values, as well as Chakravarthy's contention that the most important characteristic of firm performance is management's ability to transform the firm and adapt to a rapidly changing environment. By contrast, little support is found for the maximization of stockholder wealth criterion of Rappaport.","['nanDIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY', 'ECONOMIC-PERFORMANCE', 'RETURN', 'RISK', 'FIRMS', 'PROFITABILITY', 'HYPOTHESIS', 'OWNERSHIP', 'RATES']","['risk', 'firms']",performance
"In this study, we seek to advance the network perspective on new venture internationalization by examining the role of networks in accelerating new venture sales into foreign markets. We propose that knowledge derived from ventures' technology and marketing alliances increases the likelihood that new ventures begin exploiting opportunities in international markets. We also argue that the extent to which the networks open the venture to new knowledge or constrain it to knowledge already shared among the partners will influence the initiation of foreign sales by a venture. Using a longitudinal dataset of 118 ventures in the U.S. biotechnology industry, we confirm that different types of alliances (and, therefore, different types of knowledge-technology and marketing knowledge) differentially impact the likelihood of new venture internationalization. Moreover, network cohesion among venture alliances increases the likelihood that marketing alliances will promote initial foreign market sales, but decreases the likelihood that technology alliances will do so. Our research is a timely response to a call for the study of interactive effects among network structure, complex tasks, and time, and it provides a possible explanation for certain unexpected findings in studies that did not consider the effects of time.

"Although the financial crisis has elevated the interest for factors such as consumer financial healthiness, broad-scope trust, financial knowledge, and consumer relationship satisfaction, no existing model describes how these factors may influence consumer financial relationship trust. This research extends prior research by developing a conceptual framework explaining how these constructs affect consumers' trust in their financial service provider. Based on two surveys comprising 764 pension consumers and 892 mortgage consumers, respectively, the results of this study indicate that financial healthiness, broad-scope trust, knowledge, and satisfaction positively affect narrow-scope trust in financial services. Furthermore, it is found that broad-scope trust negatively moderates the relationships between financial healthiness and narrow-scope trust and between satisfaction and narrow-scope trust, respectively. In addition, the results marginally indicate that broad-scope trust negatively moderates the relationship between consumer financial knowledge and narrow-scope trust. This study encourages public policy makers, consumer organizations, and financial service providers to continue, improve, and/or develop consumer financial education programs and also encourages consumers to participate in such programs. This is especially important when broad-scope trust is low. Also, when broad-scope trust is low, financial service providers should consider devoting additional resources in satisfying their customers and/or in improving their financial healthiness.","['financial services', 'financial healthiness', 'broad-scope trust', 'financial knowledge', 'satisfaction', 'narrow-scope trustINTERPERSONAL-TRUST', 'CONSUMER-TRUST', 'GENERAL TRUST', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'INFORMATION', 'RATIONALITY', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'ORIENTATION', 'PERCEPTION', 'COMMITMENT']","['financial services', 'financial services', 'financial healthiness', 'financial healthiness', 'broad scope trust', 'broad scope trust', 'broad scope trust', 'financial knowledge', 'financial knowledge', 'satisfaction']",knowledge satisfaction
"This study investigates whether and how bricolage- and ingenieuring-type of approaches are used in successful social ventures in the learning/education sector across three different contexts (Brazil, South Africa and the US). We employ a partially grounded theory approach to examine the profiles of Ashoka fellows and find that despite the vast differences in their local environments, successful social entrepreneurs engage in similar bricolage processes in three domains of value creation: they tend to refuse limitations imposed by the environment, utilize resources in new and innovative ways, and engage a wide range of stakeholders as partners. Additionally, successful social entrepreneurs avoid just making do; instead, they rely on ingenieur-type of approach in their operational process to create and establish replicable systems to fulfil their social vision. We discuss the remarkable consistency in the approaches utilized by successful social entrepreneurs across the three countries from the perspective of theory and practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"This study explores the multidimensional construct of brand authenticity and the effect of each component on brand attachment, brand commitment, and brand loyalty by focusing on fashion brands in sporting goods. For this study, two global sports brands, Nike and Adidas, were selected, and brand stimuli (cartoons with scenarios) were designed based on a qualitative analysis of brand cases. A total of 207 usable responses were obtained from Korean consumers who had purchased the selected brands. The findings show that fashion brand authenticity consisted of seven factors: authority, fashionability, consistency, innovativeness, sustainability, origin, and heritage. Of these factors, authority, fashionability, innovativeness, and sustainability were significant predictors of brand attachment, and authority, consistency, and innovativeness were significant predictors of brand loyalty. There were differences in the effects of brand authenticity on brand attachment and brand commitment between Nike and Adidas. From a managerial and holistic marketing perspective, implications are suggested regarding the importance of managing brand authenticity in product innovation and management approaches.","['nanCOMMITMENT', 'CONSUMERS']",['consumers'],attachment commitment
"A model investigating antecedents of perceived organizational support (POS) and the role of POS in predicting voluntary turnover was developed and tested in two samples via structural equation modeling. Both samples of employees (N = 215 department store salespeople; N = 197 insurance agents) completed attitude surveys that were related to turnover data collected approximately I year later. Results suggest that perceptions of supportive human resources practices (participation in decision making, fairness of rewards, and growth opportunities) contribute to the development of POS, and POS mediates their relationships with organizational commitment and job satisfaction. Further, POS is negatively related to withdrawal, but the relationships are also mediated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

"Many decision-makers struggle to reduce commitment to failing endeavors. While de-escalation mechanisms have been documented and tested in information technology, accounting, psychology, and organizational behavior, little work has addressed de-escalation in innovation. This study identifies and examines the applicability of de-escalation mechanisms specifically in new product development (NPD) projects. Initially, we conducted an extensive literature review to identify de-escalation mechanisms found in research across different academic disciplines. Subsequently, we conducted a qualitative study using semistructured interviews to gather primary data. In total, using a sample of organizations that compete in high-technology industries, 31 managers and engineers in 15 NPD projects that were terminated prior to completion were interviewed regarding mechanisms used to de-escalate commitment to failing new product innovation projects. Several mechanisms reportedly used for innovation projects parallel those identified in the previous literature. More importantly, the authors uncover novel and previously undocumented ways to discontinue or redirect poorly performing projects. Specifically, internal competitions, feature-level de-escalation, continual assumption assessment, benchmarking, roadmaps, and comprehensive product testing are particularly well suited for innovation projects. These findings extend the body of extant literature on de-escalation of commitment to include innovation, notably in high-technology settings. The study also highlights that organizations may want to accept or even encourage failure, thereby increasing the efficacy of resource use. Implications for further research and practice are offered.","['nanSOFTWARE PROJECTS', 'SUNK COSTS', 'BAD-NEWS', 'COMMITMENT', 'INFORMATION', 'EXPLORATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'SYSTEMS', 'DECISION', 'LESSONS']","['commitment', 'information', 'decision']",commitment information technology development
"While institutional theorists have long viewed governmental mandates as a prototypical coercive pressure generating homogeneous organizational compliance, we suggest that such mandates are often subject to enforcement uncertainty, resulting in a pressure more aptly characterized as semicoercive and a compliance result more aptly characterized as heterogeneous. We advance and test a theoretical framework to predict the specific form of heterogeneous compliance in semicoercive contexts, with particular attention to the differential sensitivity of firms to pressures to comply, based on differences in their specific legal, political, and social context. We use the setting of a mandated corporate governance reform in China requiring listed Chinese firms to add independent directors and find general evidence of noncompliance and more specific evidence consistent with the predictions from our sociopolitical framework. We discuss the implications of our theoretical approach and findings for future research on institutional environments, governmental regulations, organizational compliance, and corporate governance.","['corporate governance', 'institutional change', 'board of directors', 'state ownership', 'enforcement uncertainty', 'organizational complianceCORPORATE GOVERNANCE REFORMS', 'SYMBOLIC MANAGEMENT', 'INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS', 'BOARD INDEPENDENCE', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'DIRECTORS', 'POWER', 'RESPONSIVENESS', 'DIFFUSION', 'STRATEGY']","['corporate governance', 'corporate governance', 'enforcement uncertainty', 'enforcement uncertainty', 'directors']",china regulations
"Research summary: Within an ecosystem, standard setting coordinates development of complementary technologies across firms. But each firm can itself own multiple of these complementary technologies. We study how a firm's own complementary technologies influence its disclosure inclination during standard setting. We identify a tradeoff: disclosure increases value-creation of the firm's non-disclosed complementary technologies, but also heightens expropriation risk. Using data on the U.S. communications equipment industry 1991-2008, we show that the firm's complementary technologies increase its disclosure inclination when its technological areas are less crowded, but decrease such inclination when there are SSO members with strong expropriation abilities. Findings stress that disclosure involves but a piece of the firm's portfolio; a systemic perspective of the entire portfolio provides a more comprehensive picture of value-creation during standard setting. Managerial summary: Why should a firm disclose its key technology to participate in standard setting within an ecosystem? We urge managers to think beyond disclosing to ensure compatibility with other firms' complementary technologies within the ecosystem as a motivation, to also consider how disclosure affects the firm's own complementary technologies within its portfolio. Disclosure in one technological area makes the firm's nondisclosed complementary technologies in other areas more valuable to itself, especially with fewer rivals competing in these other areas. But disclosure also renders the firm susceptible to losing these complementary technologies to rivals, especially when rivals have strong expropriation abilities. Analyzing disclosure decisions by communication equipment firms, we show that this tradeoff is indeed a relevant consideration in managers' strategic calculations when participating in standard setting.

"Most research on corporate directors has focused on two roles: agency and resource dependence. While these two roles are theoretically and practically distinct, previous research has used the same classification scheme for measuring board composition regardless of role examined. Our paper examines the resource dependence role of directors and posits that the widely used insider/outsider categorizations do not adequately capture this role of directors. A taxonomy of directors is presented specifically for studying the resource dependence role. We then apply the taxonomy to a sample of US airline firms undergoing deregulation, and examine how board composition changes parallel the changing resource dependence needs of the firms. We conclude that the board's function as a link to the external environment is an important one, and that firms respond to significant changes in their external environment by altering board composition.","['nanPERFORMANCE', 'GOVERNANCE', 'TOP', 'FIRM', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'OWNERSHIP', 'TURNOVER', 'IMPACT', 'MODEL']",['firm'],board taxonomy

Key mediating variables in this process are employee voice during the PA session and justice judgments. Structural equation modeling analyses of longitudinal data support our model.

"This paper theorizes and tests how chief executive officers' (CEOs') transformational leadership behaviors, which motivate followers to do more than expected and act for the good of the collective, influence followers' commitment. We theorize that CEOs' values may either enhance or attenuate the effect of transformational behaviors on followers, depending on followers' reactions to the congruence or incongruence between leaders' internal values and their outward transformational behaviors. Self-enhancement values-focusing on the leader's own happiness-would attenuate the effect, whereas self-transcendent values-focusing on others' happiness-would accentuate the effect of CEOs' transformational behaviors on followers' commitment. Using a sample of 45 managers in two companies in China, we validated a Q-sort method of measuring personal values. Results of a second study using cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys as well as interview data from a sample of Chinese CEOs, top managers, and middle managers supported both the attenuation and the accentuation effects and validated the idea that middle managers can detect their CEOs' values.(circle)","['nanINDIVIDUAL-VALUES', 'VALUE CONGRUENCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'CULTURE', 'CHINESE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'ATTRIBUTES', 'COMPONENTS', 'MATTER', 'MODEL']",['chinese'],transformational leadership values happiness

"This article explores how professional service firms (PSFs) manage across borders. When clients require consistent services delivered across multiple locations, especially across borders, then firms need to develop an organization that is sufficiently flexible to be able to support such consistent service delivery. Our discussion is illustrated by the globalization process of law firms. We argue that the globalization of large corporate law firms primarily takes place in terms of investments in the development of protocols, processes and practices that enhance internal consistency such that clients receive an 'effortless experience' of the service across multiple locations worldwide. Over the longer term the ability to deliver such effortless experience is dependent upon meaningful integration within and across the firm. Firms that achieve this are building a source of sustainable competitive advantage. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

"A substantial body of literature on new forms of organizing has forecast the end of bureaucracy. More recent empirical studies, however, indicate that high-performing organizations are adopting dual forms of organizing in which the controllability advantages associated with traditional forms work to complement and support the responsiveness attributes of new forms of organizing. The paradox is that, if organizations discard the key planning, co-ordinating and direction-setting mechanisms of traditional forms of organizing, they also remove the stabilizing dimensions of organizational form that are essential in periods of uncertainty and change. The challenge for organizations lies in learning how to manage the tensions or dualities between traditional and new forms of organizing, a process demanding the arbitration of continuity and change. This paper explores the concept of dualities and its salience in the management of organizing forms. First, the nature of dualities is explained; secondly, a set of characteristics is developed to describe the behaviour of dualities; and thirdly, suggestions are presented for arbitrating the tensions that exist in organizing form dualities. These three contributions are relevant because they signal the route to the effective creation and management of organizing form dualities, the benefit of which is the constructive combination of dynamic capabilities (underpinning innovation and responsiveness, the hallmarks of new forms of organizing) and operational capabilities (underpinning stability and efficiency, the hallmarks of traditional forms of organizing).","['nanORGANIZATIONAL FORMS', 'STRATEGY', 'EXPLOITATION', 'EXPLORATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'INNOVATION', 'PARADOX', 'COEVOLUTION', 'COMPLEX', 'VALUES']","['management', 'innovation', 'paradox']",
"Strategic marketing ambidexterity (SMA), the blend of a firm's exploitation of existing competencies and exploration of future capabilities in strategic marketing activities, represents a dynamic capability that is vital in achieving superior performance. Given its criticality, the authors examine how firm antecedents and industry contexts affect the shift in a firm's SMA over time (movement in the blend of exploitation and exploration). In addition, the authors examine SMA's influence on firm financial outcomes, i.e., risk and return. Using data from 1999 to 2011 on publically traded firms, the authors show that firm maturity and slack (financial and strategic) are key determinants of SMA. Specifically, increased firm maturity and strategic slack result in a shift toward exploitation, whereas increased financial slack results in a shift toward exploration. Industry competitiveness moderates these effects. In terms of the financial performance implications of SMA, the authors find that shifts in SMA toward exploitation increase return, but they also increase firm-idiosyncratic risk. The authors conclude with implications for theory and managerial practice.","['Dynamic capabilities', 'Ambidexterity', 'Marketing strategy', 'Firm risk and returnRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'LIFE-CYCLE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY', 'SLACK RESOURCES', 'CROSS-SECTION', 'FIRM VALUE', 'EXPLORATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EXPLOITATION', 'CAPABILITIES']","['ambidexterity', 'exploration', 'performance', 'exploitation', 'capabilities']",strategic marketing ambidexterity performance performance practice

"Firms can substantially profit from customer referrals, but they must understand the different stages of the referral process to determine what drives the number of referrals (first stage), conversion (second stage), and average contribution margin per referral (third stage). Applying a framework that integrates perceptual and behavioral drivers, this study uses a financial services company's customer survey and transaction data to investigate how the effect of contribution margins of referring customers at all three stages depends on their perceived extraversion and opinion leadership. Extreme extraversion and opinion leadership diminish the positive effect of the contribution margins of referring customers on the number of referrals; their effect on the number of successful referrals is insignificant.

"Measures developed for the analysis of corporate diversification have become fundamental to a broad range of strategy research. This paper examines the content validity of the two most widely used continuous measures of related diversification the related component of the entropy index and the concentric index-and raises fundamental questions about their validity as indicators of portfolio relatedness. These questions are not driven by the use of SIC data for estimation of the indexes; they involve validity problems intrinsic to the construction of the measures. The related component of entropy and the concentric index are sensitive to features of corporate portfolio composition that may not be directly linked to portfolio relatedness. These sensitivities can create important ambiguities in strategy research.

"Consumers' response to mass media can be difficult to assess because individuals choose for themselves the amount of media they consume, and that choice may be correlated with their other consumption decisions. To avoid this selection problem, this article examines the introduction of television to the US, during which some cities gained access to television years before others. This natural experiment makes it possible to estimate the causal impact of television on the decision to start smoking, a consumer behavior with important public health implications. Difference-in-differences analyses of television's introduction indicate that (1) television did cause people to start smoking, (2) 16- to 21-year-olds were particularly affected by television, and (3) much of the response to television occurred within a couple of years of its introduction. Our preferred estimates suggest that television increased the share of smokers in the population by 5-15 percentage points, generating roughly 11 million additional smokers between 1946 and 1970. More broadly, these results offer causal evidence that (1) mass media can have a large influence on consumers, potentially affecting their health, (2) media exerts an especially strong influence on teens, and (3) mass media can influence consumers more than typical changes in prices.","['smoking initiation', 'television', 'health', 'natural experiment', 'advertising', 'mass mediaSMOKING', 'ADOLESCENTS', 'CONSUMPTION', 'ANTISMOKING', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'INITIATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'DURATION', 'TOBACCO', 'IMPACT']","['television', 'health', 'natural experiment', 'natural experiment', 'consumption', 'impact']",media consumption health

Furthermore, central to bundling resource combinations is the contracting process, which generates information that leads to more efficient solutions that are achieved through intense bargaining and ingenuity, that in turn lead to discovery of new economic opportunities. However, in a world of positive transaction costs, the notion of the firm as a nexus of (complete) contracts is less useful for the authors' purposes; rather, the firm is defined as a nexus of incomplete contracts, which enables the possibility of entrepreneurial alertness and ingenuity. Thus, the authors maintain that the contracting process is a form of the entrepreneurial discovery process enabling firms to sense and seize new economic opportunities. Furthermore, the authors suggest that property rights theory informs a contractual process-oriented approach for analyzing how dynamic capabilities are developed, sustained, and rejuvenated and in so doing intertwines firm boundary issues with the capabilities dimension of a strategic theory of the firm.","['dynamic capabilities', 'property rights', 'incomplete contracts', 'entrepreneurshipRESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'TRANSACTION COSTS', 'ECONOMIC-THEORY', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'VERTICAL INTEGRATION', 'GOVERNANCE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'INFORMATION']","['dynamic capabilities', 'dynamic capabilities', 'property rights', 'property rights', 'incomplete contracts', 'incomplete contracts', 'transaction costs', 'transaction costs', 'dynamic capabilities', 'dynamic capabilities', 'organization', 'information']",property rights theory dynamic capabilities
"The emergence of organized civil society and of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as organizational manifestations of broader social movements has dramatically altered the global political-economic landscape. The increasing global reach of NGOs challenges established international business (IB) research, and highlights opportunities for broadening and adapting extant paradigms in the field. In this article, we introduce the concept of NGOs and contrast them with their private-sector ( firm) and public-sector ( government) counterparts within the context of IB. We discuss factors giving rise to NGOs as important organizational entities that participate in global value creation and governance, and identify limits to their efficacy and viability. We identify important questions raised by incorporating NGOs into our conceptualization of global context, and we challenge three basic tenets of IB theory: the definition and dynamics of an institutional field, the relevance/centrality of a firm-government (i.e., two-sector) bargaining model, and the pre-eminence of the firm as the global organization of interest within the field. We conclude by offering suggested research directions that should serve as catalysts for this new and potentially rich area of future IB research.","['NGO', 'nongovernmental organization', 'civil societyECLECTIC PARADIGM', 'CIVIL-SOCIETY', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'STRATEGY', 'POWER', 'GLOBALIZATION', 'POLITICS', 'TRADE', 'ACCOUNTABILITY', 'INFORMATION']","['ngo', 'nongovernmental organization', 'nongovernmental organization', 'civil society', 'civil society']",ngos social movements international business governance
"This study explores how larger Japanese firms, and in turn the Japanese economy, has restructured since the burst of Japan's asset-inflated economic bubble in 1989. Based on interviews, surveys, and analysis of the appointment calendars of 79 Japanese CEOs, this research examines changes in CEO priorities since 1989 and how these changes reflect larger shifts in the way business is conducted in larger Japanese firms. The authors find that Japanese CEOs and their firms are becoming much more focused on investor relations than on bank relations, more focused on media relations and promoting their firm to the market, and less focused on government relations as Japan undergoes deregulation. The authors also find that Japanese CEOs are focusing more on external factors, with greater emphasis on shareholders and less attention to employees. Within the firm, Japanese decision-making is becoming more top-down than middle-up-down, as well as less hierarchical with fewer levels of management. In addition, Japanese CEOs and their firms are focusing more on outsourcing and hiring non-regular workers. The most surprising finding, however, is the absence of radical change in terms of personnel-related priorities and practices, in light of the length and degree of Japan's recession.","['nanPERFORMANCE', 'FIRMS']",['firms'],firms bubble
"Front-end new product development (NPD) is fraught with tensions that fuel and inhibit innovation. According to paradox theory, tensions pose a double-edged sword, sparking learning and creativity or anxiety and counterproductive responses. NPD teams' shared understandingshow they think about (cognition) and approach (motivation) tensionsturn the sword. Existing literature examines innovation tensions and their management. Yet scholars call for deeper dives, seeking research that unpacks cognitive and motivational drivers underlying how NPD teams cope with tensions. This paper responds, presenting a four-year inductive study of five NPD consultancies. Across cases, findings explicate the roles of paradoxical cognitive frames and regulatory motivational focus. Across firms, the front-end NPD teams framed tensions paradoxically. Three framesguided freefall, benevolent dictatorship, and cohesive diversityhelped teams develop shared understandings of tensions as paradoxical, posing competing yet interdependent demands. Teams varied, however, in their regulatory focus, influencing how they applied the frames to approach tensions. In the most innovative case, teams applied a promotion focus, energized to explore tensions in search of more creative alternatives and synergies. In less innovative cases, teams applied a prevention focus, motivated to avoid risk and loss. Together, paradoxical frames and regulatory focus shaped teams' coping behaviors and resulting innovation. Resulting theory posits the interplay among cognitive, motivational, and behavioral drivers of innovation. Results offer three contributions. First, this study extends understanding of antecedents to team innovation and front-end NPD. Second, findings deepen insights into team cognition and paradoxical frames. Last, the theoretical framework explicates how cognitive-motivational interactions enable coping behaviors that foster innovation. The conclusion poses managerial and research implications. Building from paradox theory this study suggests means to foster shared paradoxical frames and promotion focus in NPD teams. Further, study limitations highlight opportunities to extend its generalizability and elaborate underlying drivers of innovation.","['nanPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'REGULATORY FOCUS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'WORK GROUPS', 'INNOVATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL', 'PARADOX', 'TECHNOLOGY']","['regulatory focus', 'regulatory focus', 'innovation', 'management', 'paradox']",firms
"In an effort to comprehend activism toward corporations, scholars have proposed the concept of corporate opportunity structure, or the attributes of individual firms that make them more (or less) attractive as activist targets. We theorize that the personal values of the firm's elite decision makers constitute a key element of this corporate opportunity structure. We specifically consider the political ideology conservatism versus liberalism of the company's CEO as a signal for employees who are considering the merits of engaging in activism. To test of our theory, we examine the formation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender employee groups in major companies in the period 1985-2004, when the formation of such roups was generally perceived to be risky for participants. Using CEOs' records of political donations to measure their personal ideologies, we find strong evidence that the political liberalism of CEOs influences the likelihood of activism. We also find that CEOs' ideologies influence activism more strongly when CEOs are more powerful, when they oversee more conservative (i.e., less liberal) workplaces, and when the social movement is in the early phase of development. We identify theoretical and practical implications, as well as future research opportunities.","['nanANTI-BIOTECH MOVEMENT', 'HIGH-RISK ACTIVISM', 'PRIVATE POLITICS', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'POWER', 'GAY', 'MARKETS', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'DISCRIMINATION', 'RESPONSIVENESS']","['power', 'gay']",political ideology research

"Drawing on the sociological literature of state bureaucracy, we develop a political incentive perspective on FDI inflows. We argue that political term, as a core feature of career advancement in state bureaucracy, influences the incentives of newly appointed government officials and in turn their efforts toward achieving the state's goal of attracting FDI. Due to the mandatory retirement age which limits the career advancement, officials in their first terms perceive that they have better chances of promotion and hence have stronger incentives to work toward advancement than those continuing to serve in the current position for the following term. We test this argument by examining Chinese city government leaders and FDI inflows in their cities from 2003 to 2010, using a difference-in-differences design. The results show that first-term leaders, who are newly appointed after political turnover, attract more FDI inflows than continuing leaders. The difference is smaller when the new leaders are close to retirement, but greater if they are appointed to cities with low prior GDP performance. This study offers a new perspective on intra-country FDI variations, and extends the literature on the role of political institutions by investigating the political incentives of government officials.","['bureaucracy', 'political incentives', 'FDI inflows', 'China', 'difference-in-differencesSUBSIDIARY PERFORMANCE EVIDENCE', 'SUBNATIONAL REGION MATTER', 'STATE CAPACITY', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'LOCATION CHOICE', 'ECONOMIC-GROWTH', 'CAREER CONCERNS', 'TERM LIMITS', 'FOREIGN', 'CORRUPTION']","['bureaucracy', 'political incentives', 'political incentives', 'fdi inflows', 'fdi inflows']",fdi incentives performance institutions
"Agglomeration research investigates the benefits that firms receive from locating in close geographic proximity. Despite a substantial surge in interest in this topic over the past 20 years, a lack of distinction among unique manifestations of spatial concentrations of similar firms threatens continuing progress in this stream of research. We argue that agglomerations of related firms that draw benefits from the supply-related externalities of increased access to specialized labour, specialized inputs, and knowledge spillovers are fundamentally different from those that draw benefits from heightened demand realized through reduction in consumer search costs. Extending agglomeration theory, we explicate the differences between these distinct phenomena, discuss how the nature of key theoretical relationships varies across these agglomeration types, and demonstrate significant implications for research. We discuss how the differences affect a host of theoretical relationships and empirical research decisions.","['nanUS LODGING INDUSTRY', 'MANHATTAN HOTEL INDUSTRY', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS', 'SPATIAL COMPETITION', 'INCREASING RETURNS', 'UNITED-STATES', 'CLUSTERS', 'LOCATION', 'FIRMS']","['knowledge spillovers', 'knowledge spillovers', 'firms']",agglomeration knowledge spillovers search costs
"P>Intra-organizational networks of practice (NOPs) confront managers with a dilemma: they must manage NOPs to reap benefits from integrating geographically dispersed knowledge, but the inherently emergent nature of NOPs implies that management control may frustrate practice-related knowledge to be shared. Based on a case study of 22 NOPs in a geographically dispersed development organization ('TDO'), we develop a model that disentangles the dynamics underlying this dilemma, helping to better understand it. Specifically, four dynamic relationships are interrelated and involve four kinds of embeddedness (organizational, in practice, relational, and structural) that relate dynamically to knowledge sharing in NOPs. Interventions in both the content shared in the network and the connections among network members can influence each of these relations. This study contributes to theoretical and practical understanding of how to manage NOPs without killing them.","['nanKNOWLEDGE-BASED THEORY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY', 'SHARING KNOWLEDGE', 'COMMUNITIES', 'MANAGEMENT', 'INNOVATION', 'EVOLUTION', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'CAPABILITY', 'AMBIGUITY']",['management'],networks knowledge model embeddedness
"We propose that the experience and expression of emotional complexity, including the simultaneous and sequential experience of emotional complexity, can be beneficial for leaders' ability to lead change. Using the social functions of emotions perspective, we suggest that the primary function of emotional complexity is to increase cognitive flexibility. Specifically, we present a model that explains how, when, and why emotional complexity is functional for leaders at the individual and interpersonal levels of analysis. At the individual level, leaders who experience emotional complexity are more cognitively flexible and, thus, make more adaptive decisions. We further propose that not all leaders will experience such benefits from emotional complexity; individual differences of neuroticism and openness to experience will moderate the leader emotional complexity-cognitive flexibility relationship. Extending our analysis to the interpersonal level, we propose that when followers observe leaders expressing emotional complexity, they will make positive inferences of cognitive flexibility and be empowered to act proactively. We explore a relational factor-the followers' shared vantage point with their leader-and a situational factor-competing demands as moderators of this relationship. We draw attention to the broader implications of our theorizing for research on leadership and emotions and its practical implications for management.","['nanINDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'SELF-ESTEEM', 'RELATIONSHIP CONFLICT', 'POSITIVE EMOTIONS', 'EVERYDAY LIFE', 'PERSONALITY', 'MODEL', 'WORK', 'PERFORMANCE']",['model'],flexibility
"This paper and the two that follow examine a simple, yet important, question: To what extent can differences in national cultures systematically influence whether and for what reasons nations adopt - or fail to adopt - available emerging technologies? Unfortunately, little in the way of systematic research has been done on this important topic. In particular, there is a lack of grounded modeling that could help explain the culture-technology adoption relationship, as well as an absence of solid case studies exploring the impact of culture on technology adoption. To address this issue, we first examine some recent thinking about how such relationships may emerge. Based on this, specific country cases studies involving technology adoption in Brazil and South Korea are presented in the two articles that follow. Each of the three articles was researched and written by investigators from two different cultures to enhance the cross-cultural perspective of the analysis. Taken together, we hope this forum on culture and technology adoption will stimulate additional research and theory building in this area.

"It is generally believed that creativity enhances innovative activities. However, empirical research regarding the impact of creativity on innovation, although positive, has produced a wide range of results. In this study, we conduct a meta-analysis of 52 empirical samples comprising 10,538 observations to test the nature of this relationship, and in particular how organizational, environmental, and cultural factors moderate the creativity-innovation link. We find a strong positive relationship between creativity and innovation, especially at the individual level. In addition, we find intriguing moderating effects in which the relationship between creativity and innovation is stronger for large firms, process innovations, and low-tech industries relative to small firms, product innovations, and high-tech industries. Further, we find that moderate levels of uncertainty avoidance maximize the correlation between creativity and innovation. We conclude by discussing theoretical and managerial implications and offering suggestions for future research in the entrepreneurship and innovation literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"This study evaluates alternative measurement approaches to examining the relationship between perceived quality performance, customer satisfaction, and repurchase loyalty. The authors define and measure the constructs within a relative attitudinal framework and compare these results to a noncomparative or individual evaluation of products. In addition, loyalty is measured and defined as self-reported repurchase behavior instead of purchase intention. The proposed model, with satisfaction as a mediator between quality and repurchase loyalty, was found to bean acceptable representation of the data across four products and for both comparative and noncomparative evaluations. The use of relative attitudes, however indicated a much stronger relationship between quality, satisfaction, and loyalty than the attitudes toward a product when they are performed as an individual evaluation. With respect to predictive ability, the study findings suggest that quality, satisfaction, and loyalty should be defined and measured within a relative attitudinal framework.","['nanCUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'SERVICE QUALITY', 'CONSUMER SATISFACTION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'METAANALYSIS', 'FRAMEWORK', 'CONTEXT']","['behavior', 'framework']",model attitudes
"There is a growing concern that a large portion of innovation, one area in which the United States has excelled, may soon follow manufacturing to less costly, more efficient countries overseas. Although U.S. innovators collectively still have more patentable technologies granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) than all other countries, offshore competitors have made substantial gains with recent year-to-year percent increases much larger than the United States. Of concern is the relatively low number of patents granted to academic innovators. In spite of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, success in this area has been limited with the proportion of patents from academia being less than 2 percent of the total patents awarded in the United States in the years since the act. Consequently, this article examines the U.S. technology development process in a descriptive study to determine exactly how and where academic and corporate inventors differ in their approaches. A series of structured interviews with academic and corporate innovators was conducted as part of a larger study investigating the technology development processes of academic and corporate inventors. Each inventor developed a concept map describing the particular process followed. To do this, a comprehensive set of possible development process elements was compiled. Inventors were then asked to select and then to arrange the elements they actually used to reflect their individual process. The resultant maps were examined using five different approaches-three quantitative and two qualitative. These analyses clearly documented that, on average, academic inventors used significantly less elements in their process (maps) than did their corporate counterparts, and further, that there was little commonality among elements on the academic maps. Overall, the corporate maps were viewed as being more complete, correct, and organized than the academic maps. This article reveals that for a small number of academic inventors and for a single technology scope, activities such as defining the market and IT growth potential, actual versus planned cost evaluation, and determination of changing customer needs/market requirements are not being conducted by the inventor. If such activities were performed either by the academic inventor or more logically by the PTO, more licensures and patents may occur.","['nanPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'INNOVATION', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MODEL']",['innovation'],innovation
"The ability to develop and manage effective networks is a crucial entrepreneurial competence for venture establishment and growth. Relatively little attention has been paid to the network development and networking activities of female entrepreneurs in general, and even less to such activities in technology-based ventures. The limited existing evidence suggests that female entrepreneurs may develop different approaches to network development and participation to that of their male counterparts. This article presents findings from exploratory, qualitative research conducted in Northern Ireland, which focused on the nature and dynamics of female entrepreneurial networks in traditionally male-dominated science, engineering and technology-based ventures. Drawing upon information-rich evidence from 18 in-depth interviews with the lead female entrepreneurs of technology-based ventures, insights are presented into the nature and dynamics of female entrepreneurial networks and networking at different stages of the business life cycle.","['entrepreneurial networks', 'female entrepreneurs', 'new-technology ventures', 'new venture creationWOMENS', 'GENDER']","['entrepreneurial networks', 'entrepreneurial networks', 'female entrepreneurs', 'female entrepreneurs']",network technology
"Purpose - This paper seeks to introduce a six-sigma based methodology for the SCM domain which was developed and has been used in Samsung. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides a detailed description of how and why a six-sigma-based methodology for the SCM domain was developed in Samsung and presents a real industry case to illustrate the usage of the methodology. Findings - In Samsung, the effort and investment in synthesizing SCM and six sigma, and developing a unique six-sigma-based methodology to improve its SCM operation, have turned out to be fruitful. The Black Belt program has produced highly qualified and talented SCM specialists, who are currently training the methodology to members in their organizations and leading SCM projects. SCM projects are being prepared and conducted in a more disciplined way and their outcomes are continuously monitored and shared through the company's repository. Research limitations/implications - To generalize its usefulness, the methodology needs to be applied to the SCM projects of those companies whose organizational and cultural contexts are different from those of Samsung. In addition, the overview of an illustrative SCM project presented in the paper is brief due to space limitations. Practical implications - Today, SCM is increasingly recognized as a strategic way to innovate a company's business operation. This paper shows that a methodology such as Samsung's SCM six sigma can be the key to conducting SCM projects in a more disciplined way and for fruitful outcomes. Originality/value - The paper introduces a unique six-sigma-based methodology for the SCM domain which has been developed and applied in a leading global manufacturing, financial, and services conglomerate. This methodology could be adapted by other companies for their SCM projects to increase the likelihood of project success.","['six sigma', 'supply chain management', 'project managementnan']","['six sigma', 'six sigma']",six sigma black belt

"Recent international business research on international joint ventures focuses on how firms can use such ventures for knowledge access and learning to enhance their competitiveness, thereby increasing competition in the industry. By contrast, research in industrial organization economics has observed that firms can also use joint ventures in various ways to attenuate competition. In this paper, we join these two streams of research to investigate the conditions under which joint ventures reduce or enhance competition by empirically testing the effects of different types of joint ventures on industry profitability. Our results suggest that joint ventures can be pro-competitive or anti-competitive, depending on whether or not they are formed between competing firms, represent foreign market entry, and operate in relatively concentrated industries. Our paper shows the importance of adopting a contingent approach to evaluating the competitive implications of joint ventures, and it also points to the value of reinvigorating international business research on the competitive context and consequences of interfirm collaboration.

"This paper describes and tests a model of the impact of front-end innovation activities on product performance. Data were collected from 272 companies to test the hypothesis that front-end performance impacts new product performance in the marketplace while controlling for new product development (NPD) processes and strategy. The data support the hypothesis that front-end performance favorably and independently impacts overall product success, time to market, market penetration, and financial performance. Front-end performance is predicted by a set of activities, including: the actual amount of front-end work done in various areas, specifically marketing, R&D, and concept development; the existence of a front-end process; the existence of a champion; and agreement on the order of developmental steps in the front end. Front-end activities are related to front-end performance, and front-end performance is related to NPD performance. This relationship highlights the distinction between front-end activities and standard product development practices and the importance of building competency in the front end. This is the first study that quantifies both the nature and amount of work done in the front end and relates that work to commercial performance. This research empirically demonstrates the distinction between the front-end and formal stages and gates types of systems. This suggests that the concept of the front end needs it own set of theoretical constructs to adequately describe and predict this categorically different set of activities. While this study demonstrates the difference between front-end and stage-gate systems, it does not establish the limits of those activities. From a managerial point of view recognizing that formal development and front-end activities are different mandates that these activities must be managed differently. In particular, the skills, structures, processes, governance, leadership, performance metrics, and resources must be assessed separately and differently. These findings suggest that firms should actively manage the flow of ideas from the front end into the more formal development programs.","['nanSINGLE-ITEM', 'DEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS', 'MULTIPLE-ITEM', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'SUCCESS', 'ASSOCIATIONS', 'CHAMPIONS', 'BOUNDARY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'LABOR']",['success'],model innovation development systems
"In recent years, a market-oriented corporate culture increasingly has been considered a key element of superior corporate performance. Although organizational innovativeness is believed to be a potential mediator of this market orientation-corporate performance relationship, much of the evidence to date remains anecdotal or speculative. In this context, the authors present a systematic framework to test the postulated market orientation-innovation-performance chain. To this end, the direct causality assumption of market orientation on organizational performance is examined with Narver and Slater's (1990) market orientation framework. Moreover, the authors take a componentwise approach and examine how the three core components of market orientation (customer orientation, competitor orientation, and interfunctional coordination) affect the two core components of organizational innovativeness (technical versus administrative) en route to affecting corporate performance. Using banking industry data, the authors empirically test and substantiate innovation's mediating role in the market orientation-corporate performance relationship.","['nanADOPTION', 'IMPACT', 'FIRMS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'ADVANTAGE', 'FRAMEWORK', 'STRATEGY', 'LEVEL']",['framework'],

"This article offers a new perspective on customer-company identification (CCI) by focusing on CCI's underlying self-motives: self-uncertainty and self-enhancement. More precisely, an operationalization is proposed in which cognitive (CCICog) and affective (CCIAff) dimensions of CCI are driven by different self-motives: CCICog by self-uncertainty and CCIAff by self-enhancement. Focusing on these self-motives reveals that CCICog and CCIAff affect some customer attitudes and behaviors in opposite ways but affect other attitudes and behaviors similarly. A cross-sectional survey that examines outcomes of CCICog and CCIAff supports the proposed conceptualization of CCI and suggests the dimensions differ in how each impacts customer-company relationships. Furthermore, the study suggests that combining the dimensions together in higher order constructs or examining only one dimension can lead to misleading conclusions.","['Customer-company identification', 'Cognitive identification', 'Affective identification', 'Organizational identificationSOCIAL IDENTITY', 'CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR', 'BRAND ATTACHMENT', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'CATEGORIZATION', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'MODEL', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'PERSONALITY', 'INTENTIONS']","['customer company identification', 'customer company identification', 'customer company identification', 'uncertainty']",customer company identification motives self uncertainty
"Purpose - Motivated by a lack of studies in graduate level supply chain education, this research aims to explore trends in supply chain-related graduate programmes in Europe and to propose a framework for designing such programmes. Design/methodology/approach - The authors determine knowledge and skills areas applicable to supply chain management (SCM) education and analyse supply chain-related graduate programmes published by the European Logistics Association in 2004. They revisit the same programmes in 2011 to determine the recent situation and the trends. The authors use cluster analysis to reveal the similarities and differences among these programmes. Findings - The authors find two distinct clusters: focused and diversified. Focused programmes offer modules in knowledge and skills areas apart from SCM at a negligible level and place more emphasis on SCM in 2011 when compared to 2004. Diversified programmes show a similar increase in the emphasis on SCM with more variety in the knowledge and skills areas. Research limitations/implications - The authors' findings are based on SCM programmes delivered in Europe and over two discrete time periods. Future research should seek to extend this analysis to other continents with larger samples and incorporate the industry perspective to determine the potential gap between what programmes offer and what industry requires. Practical implications - SCM-related graduate programmes continue to redefine themselves. Clustering predominantly serves the universities in reassessing and re-engineering their programmes, helps prospective graduates in their selection process and assists managers in their recruitment practices. Originality/value - This paper establishes a baseline for assessing SCM-related graduate programmes with respect to the knowledge and skills they offer and introduces a framework that may serve as a starting point for the design and positioning of such programmes.","['Supply chain management', 'Education', 'Cluster analysis', 'Europe', 'Graduates', 'Learning cyclesLOGISTICS', 'FUTURE', 'DEMAND']","['supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'education', 'cluster analysis', 'cluster analysis', 'europe', 'graduates', 'future']",education supply chain management logistics cluster analysis universities
"We propose that consideration of affective events theory can enrich our understanding of leader-member exchange (LMX) development. Drawing from previous research, we argue that high-quality LMX relationships progress through three stages: role taking, role making, and role routinization. Affective events theory indicates that emotions are relevant at each of these three stages, although their influence is manifested in different ways and at different levels of analysis. During the initial role-taking stage, leaders' affective expressions serve as affective events influencing member emotions through the processes of emotional contagion and affective empathy, which determine the progress of further relationship development. Next, during the role-making stage, leaders and members are both sources of affective events, and they may gradually become affectively entrained such that their affective states tend to fluctuate in a common rhythm. This pattern of dyadic-level affect helps to build high-quality LMX relationships over time. Finally, during the role routinization stage, an LMX relationship has been formed but, we argue, could subsequently change based on member emotional responses to the distribution of LMX relationships within a workgroup (LMX differentiation).","['nanNEGATIVE EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE', 'FOLLOWER PERFORMANCE', 'FACIAL EXPRESSIONS', 'COUNTING BLESSINGS', 'BASIC EMOTIONS', 'MOOD LINKAGE', 'WORK', 'CONTAGION', 'GRATITUDE']","['work', 'contagion']",leader member exchange lmx emotions
"This article investigates the methodological sophistication of case studies as a tool for generating and testing theory analyzing case studies-published during the period 1995-2000 in 10 influential management journals.

"This paper examines the link between consensus among senior managers and performance at the SBU level and considers factors which may moderate the strength of this relationship. Using data from a cross-national study in three industry sectors, the authors find that consensus increases the performance of the SBU in the case of a differentiation strategy but not in the case of a low-cost strategy. Additionally, the relationship between consensus on a differentiation strategy and performance is negatively influenced by dynamism of the market. This research thus clarifies and extends prior consensus research by indicating the conditions under which consensus positively affects performance. For managers, our results indicate that investing managerial time in obtaining consensus is more important for a differentiation than for a low-cost strategy and is particularly important when using a differentiation strategy in a stable environment.

"Several approaches have been used to explore environmental dynamism as a contingent predictor of the relationship between rational-comprehensive strategic decision-making and firm-level performance. At the decision level of analysis, however, small sample sizes, low statistical power, and statistical dependence have plagued the research. Through the use of a simulated decision-making environment and multilevel analysis, this study examined 400 decisions from 54 executive teams. Consistent with much of the existing firm-level research, the results indicated that environmental dynamism may moderate the relationship between rational-comprehensive decision making and decision quality. Surprisingly, the form of the relationship differed from much of the firm-level research.

"Firms' access to academic discoveries through R&D collaborations has been shown to enhance their patent performance. However, increasing both internal and external R&D activities can lead to high knowledge redundancy and coordination costs. This paper examines what kind of R&D focus inside the firm will improve or reduce the benefits of R&D collaborations with universities. Our results show that technological recombination focus strengthens the relationship between university collaborations and patent performance, whereas scientific research focus weakens the relationship. These results also differ between young and old firms, implying that firms may shift their R&D focus according to their collaborative objectives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"In this paper, we examine the impact of various configurations of regulatory fit on the attitudes, exercise intentions and actual behavior of members of a health club loyalty program. Regulatory fit is conceptualized as both the match between types of program rewards and how they are communicated, as well as the congruence between reward types and regulatory focus as a stable, individual disposition. In two experimental designs, non-point reward programs offering a short-term cash bonus were used. The results of Study 1 suggest that regulatory fit has a positive impact on perceived value, exercise intentions and exercise intensity, but not on visit frequency. Analysis of repeated behavioral measures further reveals that regulatory fit has a stronger impact on exercise intensity over time relative to nonfit. Study 2 also confirms the predictive power of regulatory fit over nonfit when conceptualized as the match between reward type and trait regulatory focus.","['Regulatory fit', 'Value perception', 'Customer loyalty programsPROSPECT-THEORY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'FOCUS', 'INTENTIONS', 'PERSUASION', 'PROMOTION', 'EXERCISE', 'SALES', 'EXPLANATIONS', 'CREDIBILITY']","['regulatory fit', 'regulatory fit', 'behavior', 'focus', 'intentions', 'exercise']",attitudes intensity focus
"International strategies vary in their potential to exploit and augment a firm's resources, especially its knowledge base. Resource-based analysis suggests clustering the diverse entry modes in terms of their exploitation and augmentation characteristics. We thus introduce a new categorization of entry modes based on their potential to augment the resources of an entrant. We then explore the antecedents of these modes, and advance testable propositions delimiting for which firms and in which circumstances each mode maximizes long-term value creation. Finally, we outline how our resource-based framework complements transaction-cost-based frameworks.

"The upward voicing of ideas is vital to organizational performance. Yet power differences between voicers and those with authority may result in valuable ideas being overlooked. In this ethnographic, 31-month longitudinal study of a multi-disciplinary team in the healthcare sector, we examine how upwardly voiced ideas can endure to reach implementation. Of 208 upwardly voiced ideas, most were rejected in the moment, but 49 reached implementation despite appearing to be initially rejected. These ideas were kept alive by other team members who later drew upon and revived the initial ideas through what we call the voice cultivation process. We detail this process and describe five pathways through which voiced ideas stayed alive to reach implementation by overcoming different forms of resistance. We illustrate how the allyship of others can help voice live on beyond its initial utterance to reach implementation and generate change, even when the person who initially spoke up is no longer on the team or advocating for the idea. By reconceptualizing voice as a collective, interactional process rather than a one-time dyadic event, this paper develops new theory on how employees can help one another's voice be heard to positively impact their teams and organizations.","['voice', 'process', 'teams', 'healthcare', 'change', 'interactional', 'public knowledge', 'allyship', 'amplifying', 'problematizing', 'group dynamics', 'implementationEMPLOYEE VOICE', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY', 'MANAGEMENT TEAMS', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'SPEAKING', 'BEHAVIOR', 'WORK', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'ANTECEDENTS']","['voice', 'process', 'teams', 'healthcare', 'change', 'interactional', 'allyship', 'organizations']",power cultivation

"Customers can interact with and create value for firms in a variety of ways. This article proposes that assessing the value of customers based solely upon their transactions with a firm may not be sufficient, and valuing this engagement correctly is crucial in avoiding undervaluation and overvaluation of customers. We propose four components of a customer's engagement value (CEV) with a firm. The first component is customer lifetime value (the customer's purchase behavior), the second is customer referral value (as it relates to incentivized referral of new customers), the third is customer influencer value (which includes the customer's behavior to influence other customers, that is increasing acquisition, retention, and share of wallet through word of mouth of existing customers as well as prospects), and the fourth is customer knowledge value (the value added to the firm by feedback from the customer). CEV provides a comprehensive framework that can ultimately lead to more efficient marketing strategies that enable higher long-term contribution from the customer. Metrics to measure CEV, future research propositions regarding relationships between the four components of CEV are proposed and marketing strategies that can leverage these relationships suggested.","['customer engagement value', 'customer lifetime value', 'customer knowledge value', 'customer influencer value', 'customer referral valueWORD-OF-MOUTH', 'LIFETIME VALUE', 'EQUITY', 'IMPACT', 'FRAMEWORK', 'BEHAVIOR', 'CONVERSATIONS', 'SATISFACTION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'INTERNET']","['customer lifetime value', 'customer lifetime value', 'customer lifetime value', 'customer knowledge value', 'customer knowledge value', 'customer knowledge value', 'customer influencer value', 'customer influencer value', 'customer influencer value', 'lifetime value', 'lifetime value', 'framework', 'behavior']",engagement value customer lifetime value
"Adopting a multilevel approach, we examined how team goal orientation may relate to team creativity and individual creativity. We also theorized and examined the bottom-up process linking individual creativity and team creativity. Multisource data were collected from 485 members and their leaders within 100 R&D teams. The results indicated that a team learning goal and team performance approach goal were positively related-whereas a team performance avoidance goal was negatively related-to both team creativity and individual creativity through team information exchange. Furthermore, a trust relationship with a team leader played a moderating role: when the trust was stronger, the indirect positive relationship with team creativity and individual creativity was stronger for the team learning goal but weaker for the team performance approach goal. We also found that average individual creativity within a team was positively related to team creativity (going above and beyond the effect of team information exchange) through a supportive climate for creativity.","['nanCROSS-LEVEL', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY', 'INDIVIDUAL CREATIVITY', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY', 'LEARNING ORIENTATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'WORK', 'INNOVATION', 'ORGANIZATIONS']","['individual creativity', 'individual creativity', 'performance']",individual trust

In particular, we revisit their theorizing as it relates to firms that had only begun to emerge when Johanson and Vahlne published their award-winning paper: born digitals.

"This research examines how future event markers influence intertemporal choice, and it demonstrates across five studies that the number of salient events between a smaller-sooner and larger-later option impacts patience. The direction of the effect depends on whether the individual relies on emotion versus reason to make decisions. For those who rely on emotion, additional events increase patience. Conversely, for individuals who rely on reason, additional events decrease patience. These effects are driven by perceptions of time, as events contract perceptions of time for emotional decision makers but expand perceptions of time for rational decision makers. Implications arise for intertemporal choice, time perception, and emotional versus rational decision making.","['time', 'intertemporal choice', 'emotional versus rational decision making', 'time perceptionSUBJECTIVE TIME PERCEPTION', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'AFFECTIVE PSYCHOLOGY', 'VERBAL INFORMATION', 'SELF-CONTROL', 'DURATION', 'PREFERENCES', 'JUDGMENTS', 'FEELINGS', 'IMPACT']","['time', 'intertemporal choice', 'intertemporal choice', 'emotional versus rational decision making', 'emotional versus rational decision making', 'emotional versus rational decision making', 'emotional versus rational decision making', 'emotional versus rational decision making', 'impact']",future
"This article examines whether and how publicly sponsored advisory services can encourage small and medium-sized firms to increase their degree of internationalization. We argue that professional advisors have an impact upon the knowledge and skills firms develop to enhance internationalization. The data examined are drawn from a publicly funded organization providing advisory services to entrepreneurial firms; they show a significant relationship between receipt of advice and the development of internationalization-related knowledge and competences. Knowledge, competences, and advice are all significant predictors that firms will adopt strategies conducive to initiating or expanding internationalization. Moreover, the results suggest that various forms of advisory services should be explicitly considered in assessing the factors which contribute to dynamic capabilities. However, pertinent public policy initiatives should incorporate performance metrics that capture the impact of such advisory services in enhancing the internationalization capabilities of entrepreneurial firms.","['entrepreneurship', 'hubs', 'internationalization', 'public advisory servicesBORN-GLOBAL FIRM', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SMES', 'ASSISTANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PROMOTION', 'STRATEGY', 'PROGRAMS', 'SURVIVAL']","['internationalization', 'dynamic capabilities', 'dynamic capabilities', 'performance']",advisors
"We develop and test a theoretical model that explores how individuals appraise different types of stressful job demands and how these cognitive appraisals impact job performance. The model also explores how charismatic leaders influence such appraisal and reaction processes, and, by virtue of these effects, how leaders can influence the impact of stressful demands on their followers' job performance. In Study 1 (n = 74 U.S. Marines), our model was largely supported in hierarchical linear modeling analyses. Marines whose leaders were judged by superiors to exhibit charismatic leader behaviors appraised challenge stressors as being more challenging, and were more likely to respond to this appraisal with higher performance. Although charismatic leader behaviors did not influence how hindrance stressors were appraised, they negated the strong negative effect of hindrance appraisals on job performance. In Study 2 ( n = 270 U.S. Marines), charismatic leader behaviors were measured through the eyes of the focal Marines, and the interactions found in Study 1 were replicated. Results from multilevel structural equation modeling analyses also indicate that charismatic leader behaviors moderate both the mediating role of challenge appraisals in transmitting the effect of challenge stressors to job performance and the mediating role of hindrance appraisals in transmitting the effect of hindrance stressors to job performance. Implications of our results to theory and practice are discussed.","['nanTRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'METAANALYTIC TEST', 'CHALLENGE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'FRAMEWORK', 'EMOTIONS', 'CITIZENSHIP', 'COMMITMENT']","['mediating role', 'mediating role', 'challenge', 'behavior']",model
Economies in transition such as Russia's are among the world's fastest growing. Entrepreneurial firms in an environment like Russia's face rapid and dramatic shifts in the institutional environment. These shifts represent significant challenges to entrepreneurial firms as they seek not only to survive but also to prosper in that environment by rapidly co-evolving with institutional changes. Prior research has focused on institutional change and its impact in developed economies. But the rate of evolution of institutions in transition economies tends to be faster and less predictable. This article reports a longitudinal study of high technology entrepreneurial firms in Russia employing a grounded theory methodology to understand how entrepreneurial ventures co-evolve with rapid institutional changes and still manage to prosper.,"['nanCHINA', 'GROWTH', 'CAPITALISM', 'LEGITIMACY', 'FRAMEWORK', 'SELECTION', 'STRATEGY', 'INDUSTRY', 'PROMISE', 'RUSSIA']",['russia'],transition

"The authors examine the effects of organizational learning on customer orientation and relationship commitment in the global supply chain. To examine the effects of exposure to organizational learning, the authors test the hypotheses in low- versus high-learning groups in two different samples. The user sample consists of 175 users, representing the international strategic business units of one U.S.-based multinational corporation (i.e., strategic business units located outside the home country of the United States). The buyer sample consists of the corporate buyers of 200 multinational corporations, and the focus is on their supply chain activities worldwide. The authors examine the activities and relationships between II) users and buyers (as perceived by the users) and (2) buyers and suppliers las perceived by the buyers) in the supply chain. Overall, the results suggest that facets of organizational learning have a positive influence on customer orientation and relationship commitment in the global supply chain.

"Research summary Building on the comparative capitalism's notion of institutional complementarities, we examine whether firms' simultaneous adoption of managerial entrenchment provisions (MEPs) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reinforces or undercuts one another in influencing firm financial performance. We propose that the financial impact of such configurations is contingent on the country's institutional setting. In Liberal Market Economies (LMEs), where firms face strong pressures to achieve short-term goals, the combination of MEPs and CSR creates shareholder value, particularly when firms engage in internally oriented CSR projects. Conversely, in Coordinated Market Economies (CMEs), where institutions already curb short-term demands, the combined adoption of MEPs and CSR initiatives destroys shareholder value, particularly when this CSR is external. Overall, our study enhances understanding of the institutional complementarity between corporate governance and CSR. Managerial summary This study examines how two organizational practices, managerial entrenchment provisions (MEPs), and corporate social responsibility (CSR), combine between them to improve or reduce firms' financial success. Our analysis demonstrates that institutional framework has a strong influence on their combined effect. When the institutional context supports solutions to coordination problems among economic agents through market-based arrangements, MEPs allow the implementation of strategies directed to promote long-term investments and relationships. In this case, MEPs when paired with CSR allow generating intangibles that contribute to create shareholder value. Contrarily, in frameworks with coordination mechanisms based on nonmarket arrangements, the joint adoption of MEPs and CSR destroys value by increasing the power of managers and blockholders to extract rents at the expense of firms' minority shareholders.","['comparative capitalism', 'corporate governance', 'corporate social responsibility', 'managerial entrenchment', 'shareholder valueANTITAKEOVER PROVISIONS', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'TAKEOVER PROTECTION', 'GOVERNANCE', 'CAPITALISM', 'FIRM', 'SUSTAINABILITY', 'STAKEHOLDERS', 'ORIENTATION', 'DISCLOSURE']","['comparative capitalism', 'comparative capitalism', 'corporate governance', 'corporate governance', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'managerial entrenchment', 'managerial entrenchment', 'financial performance', 'financial performance', 'governance', 'capitalism', 'firm']",complementarities managerial entrenchment provisions meps corporate social responsibility csr financial performance corporate governance
"While organizations and researchers have traditionally conceptualized customers as consumers of their services and products, there is a growing recognition that organizations need to develop more collaborative relationships with clients. In this research, I explore one implication of this shift-how employees respond to client conflicts. In a multi-method qualitative study, I studied patient advocates, hospital employees who mediate conflicts between patients, families, and staff. I develop a process model that shows how mediators construct a web of discrete social interactions that, over time, enables them to develop an empathetic account of the conflict. They then selectively deploy the account to engage in sensegiving. The process model integrates research on emotions and sensemaking in novel ways. I identify how emotion work triggers emotion dynamics in interactions that facilitate or disrupt sensemaking and sensegiving. I show how plausible accounts are developed over the course of social interactions and that mediators pivoted from sensemaking to sensegiving when the account was characterized by empathy. Overall, this research shows how mediators actively generate, interpret, and influence their own and others' emotions, and that mediators' emotion work contributes to the success of collective sensemaking.","['nanMANAGING EMOTIONS', 'LABOR', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'INSTITUTIONS', 'MINDFULNESS', 'COMPASSION', 'STRATEGIES', 'CONFLICT']","['labor', 'organizations', 'conflict']",model social sensegiving sensemaking work
"Using the Fortune diversity elite as a sample, the authors find significant initial shareholder gains, as measured by stock price reaction to firms publicizing their inclusion on the diversity elite list as a part of their marketing communication strategy. However these initial effects do not materialize into higher annual measures of profitability (i.e., return on equity, return on assets, and return on investment) for these firms when compared with other similarly sized firms from similar industries in the Fortune 1000 list. This suggests that for firms seeking enhancements in reportable measures of financial performance, having and publicizing a diverse workforce, including sales personnel, does not provide superior financial performance in comparison with other non-diversity elite firms.

"We employ a computational model of organizational adaptation to answer three research questions: (1) How does the architecture or structure of complexity affect the design feasibility and usefulness of boundedly rational efforts? (2) Do efforts to adapt organizational forms complicate or complement the effectiveness of first-order change efforts? and (3) To what extent does the rate of environmental change nullify the usefulness of design efforts? We employ a computational model of organizational adaptation to examine these questions. Our results, in identifying the boundary conditions around successful design efforts, suggest that the underlying architecture of complexity of organizations, particularly the presence of hierarchy, is a critical determinant of the feasibility and effectiveness of design efforts. We also find that design efforts are generally complementary to efforts at local performance improvement and identify specific contingencies that determine the extent of complementarity.

"Globalization is a major market trend today, one characterized by both increased international competition as well as extensive opportunities for firms to expand their operations beyond current boundaries. Effectively dealing with this important change, however, makes the management of global new product development (NPD) a major concern. To ensure success in this complex and competitive endeavor, companies must rely on global NPD teams that make use of the talents and knowledge available in different parts of the global organization. Thus, cohesive and well-functioning global NPD teams become a critical capability by which firms can effectively leverage this much more diverse set of perspectives, experiences, and cultural sensitivities for the global NPD effort. The present research addresses the global NPD team and its impact on performance from both an antecedent and a contingency perspective. Using the resource-based view (RBV) as a theoretical framework, the study clarifies how the internal, or behavioral, environment of the firm-specifically, resource commitment and senior management involvement-and the global NPD team are interrelated and contribute to global NPD program performance. In addition, the proposed performance relationships are viewed as being contingent on certain explicit, or strategic, factors. In particular, the degree of global dispersion of the firm's NPD effort is seen as influencing the management approach and thus altering the relationships among company background resources, team, and performance. For the empirical analysis, data are collected through a survey of 467 corporate global new product programs (North America and Europe, business-to-business). A structural model testing for the hypothesized effects was substantially supported. The results show that creating and effectively managing global NPD teams offers opportunities for leveraging a diverse but unique combination of talents and knowledge-based resources, thereby enhancing the firm's ability to achieve a sustained competitive advantage in international markets. To function effectively, the global NPD team must be nested in a corporate environment in which there is a commitment of sufficient resources and where senior management plays an active role in leading, championing, and coordinating the global NPD effort. This need for commitment and global team integration becomes even more important for success as the NPD effort becomes more globally dispersed.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'MARKET-INFORMATION', 'INNOVATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PROJECT', 'MANAGEMENT', 'INDICATORS', 'STRATEGY', 'SUCCESS']","['resource based view', 'resource based view', 'resource based view', 'performance', 'management', 'success']",

"A review of recent evidence on relative earnings from entrepreneurship versus wage work presents a puzzle: why do individuals become entrepreneurs when entrepreneurs on average apparently earn less than employees? After considering several potential explanations, we empirically analyze one: income underreporting by entrepreneurs. Using a nationwide panel survey representing U.S. households over 15 years, we estimate that entrepreneurs on average earn 4% less per year than employees. However, after correcting for income underreporting, the mean financial gain to entrepreneurship is positive and large, greater than 42%. However, we show that this estimate is built on some unpalatable model assumptions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Earlier work concentrated on ownership-specific advantages or locational determinants rather than the central concept of internalization. The few exceptions were incomplete or not well known. Internalization as applied to the MNE spread rapidly because of the appeal to IB researchers of an analytically powerful idea that was based on institutional economics and involved an accessible methodology. The spread was also helped by the parallel growth of transaction costs in the domestic theory of the firm, and the publication activity of the authors and their associates.","['internalization', 'MNE', 'history of thoughtFOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISE', 'INTERNATIONAL-TRADE', 'FIRM', 'ECONOMICS', 'CORPORATIONS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'HYMER', 'COSTS']","['internalization', 'mne', 'firm', 'economics', 'costs']",determinants costs firm
"When customers deliberately change the channel through which they do business with a firm, is that an indication of behavior change, and thus, future revenue? This research investigates the causal effects of customer channel migration to direct, company-managed or indirect, independent agent-managed online and offline channels using data from a leading international airline. In a quasi-experimental design via Mahalanobis-metric matching and conditional difference-in-differences estimation, the authors show that channel migration affects customer relationship breadth and depth: (1) Customers migrating from indirect to direct channels exhibit lower levels of relationship depth (revenue), (2) customers migrating from offline to online channels exhibit higher levels of relationship breadth (cross-buying), and (3) customers migrating from indirect offline to direct online channels exhibit higher levels of relationship depth (sales) and breadth (cross-buying). These findings expand our understanding of customer channel migration in service industries and suggest reconsidering and evaluating service firms' strategies for direct channels as a lever for short-term revenue increase. Improving service firm's direct channel relationship depth and breadth, pricing structure in direct channels must be adapted to compensate for lower sales figures per customer. In addition, direct channels services should be optimized to achieve higher conversion rates.","['customer channel migration', 'online and offline channels', 'direct and indirect channels', 'conditional difference-in-differences estimationINTERNET CHANNEL', 'SWITCHING COSTS', 'ONLINE', 'SATISFACTION', 'BIAS', 'PROFITABILITY', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PROPENSITY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'LOYALTY']","['customer channel migration', 'customer channel migration', 'customer channel migration', 'online and offline channels', 'online and offline channels', 'online and offline channels', 'online and offline channels', 'online']",customer channel migration online offline online buying
"To fulfill external accountability expectations social impact measurement has become an important practice for social enterprises.

Based on interviews with small-to-medium-sized social enterprises, this paper investigates how social entrepreneurs handle the increasing pressure to measure social impact with formal methodologies through a bricolage lens.

"A large number of visualization tools have been created to help decision makers understand increasingly rich databases of product, customer, sales force, and other types of marketing information. This article presents a framework for thinking about how visual representations are likely to affect the decision processes or tasks that marketing managers and consumers commonly face, particularly those that involve the analysis or synthesis of substantial amounts of data. From this framework, the authors derive a set of testable propositions that serve as an agenda for further research. Although visual representations are likely to improve marketing manager efficiency, offer new insights, and increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, they may also bias decisions by focusing attention on a limited set of alternatives, increasing the salience and evaluability of less diagnostic information, and encouraging inaccurate comparisons. Given this, marketing managers are advised to subject insights from visual representations to more formal analysis.","['nanINFORMATION DISPLAYS', 'CONSUMER', 'CHOICE', 'GRAPHICS', 'FORMAT', 'VISUALIZATION', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'DIMENSIONS', 'COMPLEXITY', 'STRATEGIES']","['consumer', 'format', 'visualization']",visualization framework thinking satisfaction
"Despite increasing recognition of the importance of metaphors to theory development, metaphors' influence on entrepreneurship theorizing has been largely unexplored. This is problematic because a field's metaphors shape its underlying assumptions. This study takes stock of the entrepreneurship field through its metaphors by analyzing a corpus of highly cited entrepreneurship articles. We identify and explain eight root metaphors for entrepreneurship-parenthood, mutagen, conduit of knowledge, method, mindset, networking, exploration, and politics-underpinning the mainstream of the field. We then extend and combine the metaphors to develop a research agenda for building on the metaphors and moving beyond them.","['paradigm', 'Research Agenda', 'Reframing', 'Root Metaphors', 'Review', 'ReflexivityNON-FAMILY FIRMS', 'BUSINESS PERFORMANCE', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'VENTURE PERFORMANCE', 'ORGANIZATION THEORY', 'THEORY CONSTRUCTION', 'SURVIVAL CHANCES', 'PAST RESEARCH', 'GROWTH']","['research agenda', 'research agenda', 'root metaphors', 'root metaphors']",metaphors
"We conceptualize international assignees as informational boundary spanners between multinational enterprise units, and develop a cross-level model that explores how assignees' social capital translates into inter-unit intellectual capital. First, as knowledge brokers, assignees create inter-unit intellectual capital by linking their home- and host-unit social capital, thereby enabling cross-unit access to previously unconnected knowledge resources. Second, as knowledge transmitters, assignees' host-unit social capital facilitates their creation of individual intellectual capital, which, in turn, translates into inter-unit intellectual capital. We conclude that individual social capital needs to be explicitly transferred to the organizational level to have a sustained effect on inter-unit intellectual capital.","['international assignments', 'MNE knowledge flows', 'social capital', 'intellectual capitalKNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'INDIVIDUAL-PERFORMANCE', 'NETWORK STRUCTURE', 'WEAK TIES', 'CAREER', 'ORGANIZATION', 'ASSIGNMENT', 'MANAGERS']","['social capital', 'social capital', 'organization']",knowledge
"This research contributes to institutional theory by examining the influence of informal institutions on formal institutions and the effects of formal institutions on inward foreign direct investment. In particular, the authors integrate prior research from multiple disciplines to identify and to examine the roles of a country's formal regulatory, political, and economic institutions. The results suggest that the country's informal institutions, in the form of the cultural dimensions of collectivism and future orientation, shape the country's formal institutions. In turn, each of the three formal institutions affects the country's level of inward foreign direct investment differently. To facilitate future research, the authors also provide a set of measures for formal institutions in 50 countries.","['institutional theory', 'formal and informal institutions', 'foreign direct investment', 'construct validity', 'internationalizationEXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'CULTURAL-VALUES', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'NATIONAL CULTURE', 'JAPANESE FIRMS', 'UNITED-STATES', 'INDIVIDUALISM', 'MODEL']","['institutional theory', 'institutional theory', 'foreign direct investment', 'foreign direct investment', 'foreign direct investment']",institutional theory institutions formal institutions foreign direct investment collectivism orientation
"Research summary: Pre-entry industry experience is a central construct in the founding team literature. Research on prior shared experience (PSE) emphasizes that founding teams face challenges integrating and acting on independent experiences, so PSE should be beneficial for new venture performance. Existing studies, however, typically study PSE in blunt terms, expecting that more is better. Instrumental variable analyses of a unique sample of 344 commercial banks founded in four U.S. states between 1996 and 2006 showed that industry-specific PSE may be more or less beneficial, depending on several founding team characteristics. Our findings provide nuance and caution to the narrative that PSE is always beneficial. Under some circumstances, firms with founding team PSE may be no better off than those without founding team PSE, suggesting more research is necessary to understand when and why founding team experience matters to new firms. Managerial summary: Pre-entry experience of founding teams affects new firm performance, but is hard for founders to leverage separately gained experience. Knowledge moves more readily if sets of managers leave together to start a new firm. But, it may be simplistic to conclude that prior shared experience (PSE) is always good, or better than the sum of independent experiences. In a set of banks founded in four U.S. states between 1996 and 2006, we find that PSE is not necessarily a direct pathway to better bank performance. Characteristics of the PSE, such as the part of industry the former and new banks operate in, can lower its benefit. We also found that the benefits of PSE erode as the entire founding team develops shared history after startup. Our findings have implications for entrepreneurs, investors, and policy-makers.

"Together with the developing technologies of a fast-evolving Web environment, computers, and handheld devices, human-computer interaction is gaining more importance. User interface, as the interactive layer between user and information systems, has a great role in system adoption. Based on a technology acceptance model, acceptance of a system can be explained as a function of perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU). Because several external variables have impact on PU and PEOU, the content and interface design of every single application should be addressed accordingly in a way that enhances the consumer's attitude about using the system by considering the impact of external variables through system usage. The objective of this study was to uncover potential external variables that may influence PEOU and PU, and indirectly influence behavioral attitude in mobile service acceptance and to explore the effects of those variables, primarily adaptivity and the relationships of all the variables among each other, through the limited interface of a mobile platform. Thus, developers will be able to relate the tuning of product features to the adoption of the products they are developing based on a platform.","['nanMULTIPLE-ITEM SCALE', 'INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY', 'USER ACCEPTANCE', 'COMPUTER-TECHNOLOGY', 'INTERFACE', 'SYSTEM', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'SATISFACTION', 'COMMERCE', 'ADOPTION']","['interface', 'system', 'adoption']",information systems technology acceptance model perceived usefulness
"As visible and knowledgeable experts who constantly collect, analyze, and disseminate information about the future prospects of publicly listed firms, financial analysts fulfill an important information brokerage and monitoring function for investors. By providing investment advice, financial analysts also influence the demand for a firm's stock and thus its price. Executives pay close attention to financial analysts' earnings forecasts and recommendations, so much so that they are frequently criticized for excessive focus on their forecasts at the expense of the long-term interests of the firm. But while research on analysts in strategic management is steadily growing, we lack a coherent understanding of the extent and nature of analysts' diverse influences on executives' and investors' decision making and the context in which analysts operate. This is largely due to the fragmentation of the literature and the absence of prior reviews or meta-analyses of the topic. By organizing, synthesizing, and analyzing extant research efforts on analysts in the various domains of strategic management research, we aim to advance our knowledge on the influence of analysts on firms and investors. Further, we hope that our analyses and recommendations help further increase research coverage on this important organizational stakeholder.","['financial analysts', 'strategic decision making', 'firm financial performanceSECURITIES ANALYSTS', 'CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE', 'INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION', 'INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEXITY', 'FINANCIAL ANALYSTS', 'EARNINGS PRESSURE', 'EMERGING ECONOMY', 'OF-INTEREST', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FIRM']","['financial analysts', 'financial analysts', 'financial analysts', 'financial analysts', 'firm']",analysts
"The idea that managerial discretion-defined as latitude of action-may be an important determinant of CEO compensation has been recognized for some time. However, in spite of considerable work that has implicitly invoked related ideas on the sources of potential managerial contribution, a formal test of the discretion hypothesis has yet to be conducted. In addition, few studies have tested the performance consequences of CEO pay. In a sample of Fortune 1,000 firms, we found support for both a main effect of managerial discretion on CEO pay and a contingency effect, whereby firm performance is higher when discretion and pay are aligned than when they are not.","['nanINVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY SET', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL OUTCOMES', 'MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION', 'PERFORMANCE EVALUATION', 'CORPORATE PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'INDUSTRY MATTER']","['firm performance', 'firm performance']",firms
"This study theoretically and empirically addresses the possible separation of substance and symbolism in CEO compensation contracts by examining political and institutional determinants of long-term incentive plan (LTIP) adoption and use among 570 of the largest U.S. corporations over two decades. We find that a substantial number of firms are likely to adopt but not actually use-or only limitedly use-LTIPs, suggesting a potential separation of substance and symbol in CEO compensation contracts. Analyses suggest that this decoupling of LTIP adoption and use is particularly prevalent in firms with powerful CEOs and firms with poor prior performance. Further analyses show that whereas early adopters are more likely to pursue alignment between CEO and shareholder interests substantively, later adopters may pursue legitimacy by symbolically controlling agency costs. More generally, the study highlights how decoupling in organizations can be understood in terms of both micro-political and macro-institutional forces.","['nanCHIEF EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'SHAREHOLDER WEALTH', 'GOLDEN PARACHUTES', 'FORMAL-STRUCTURE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ADOPTION', 'PAY', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'OWNERSHIP']","['performance', 'adoption', 'organizations']",ceo firms powerful performance legitimacy
"Patents play an important, and increasingly influential, role in management scholarship. In this study, we conduct a broad and systematic review of patent-based empirical work in the management field, which involves mapping the ways in which scholars are using patent-based measures to represent concepts and assessing this usage based on measurement principles. With respect to mapping, our review identifies the different types of measures that researchers have constructed based on different types of patent data (e.g., patent counts, backward citations) as well as delineates the classes of theoretical concepts that are being represented by those measures. In terms of assessing, as a complement to prior surveys of patent-based research that have assessed patents as indicators based on features of patents, patenting, and patent offices, we develop a framework that is based on measurement principles. Using this framework, our assessment of patent-based research in management reveals important patterns surrounding foundational measurement issues, i.e., method bias, validation threats, model misspecification. Our review makes two core contributions: one centering on summarizing how patents have been used in management research and one focusing on guiding management scholars in terms of common measurement issues for patent-based indicators. These contributions have important implications for future scholarly work in management.","['patents', 'measurement issues', 'knowledge flows', 'learning', 'novelty', 'innovation impact', 'patent strategy', 'R&D strategy', 'review', 'validation', 'method bias', 'model misspecificationRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'KNOWLEDGE FLOWS', 'COLLABORATION NETWORKS', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES', 'PARTNER SELECTION', 'METHOD VARIANCE', 'REAL OPTIONS', 'INNOVATION']","['patents', 'measurement issues', 'measurement issues', 'review', 'validation', 'method bias', 'method bias']",patents
"P>Past research indicates that the effect of TMT functional diversity on firm performance is equivocal. We address this issue by focusing on the integrative role of the CEO, postulating that the CEO's expertise and background characteristics affect the TMT functional diversity-firm performance relationship, because of their impact on the exchange and integration of distributed knowledge within the TMT. Using a dataset of 33 Dutch and Belgian Information Technology firms we investigate the moderating role of three sets of CEO characteristics (functional background, status as founder, and shared experience with the other TMT members) on the relationship between TMT functional diversity and firm performance. Our results reveal that CEO and TMT characteristics do interact in realizing the potential advantages of distributed TMT functional expertise.","['nanINFORMATION-SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'TRANSACTIVE MEMORY', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'POWER', 'MODEL', 'DETERMINANTS', 'IMPACT', 'AMBIDEXTERITY', 'COMMUNICATION']",['impact'],functional diversity performance
"This study examines how firm performance and family income are affected when an owner-managed firm transitions to a copreneurial business. Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics were used to track changes in firm performance and family income from 1996 to 2006 during which time an owner-manager decided to partner with his spouse. The findings suggest that (a) involvement of one's spouse in the business had no significant impact on firm profits and (b) working with one's spouse had a significant impact on family income. The authors hypothesize that the lack of spousal influence on firm performance is because of their inability to influence their spouses, their lack of education and skills needed by the firm, and organizational imprinting. Moreover, since it is hypothesized that many spouses work for little or no pay, there would not be a significant impact on family income as the result of one's partnering with a spouse. However, this hypothesis was not confirmed.","['copreneurship', 'family effect', 'founder effectFIRM PERFORMANCE', 'FAMILY OWNERSHIP', 'FOUNDING TEAM', 'AGENCY COSTS', 'TIES', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'BUSINESS']",['business'],firm performance panel study of income dynamics imprinting
"Purpose - The motivation for this study is triggered by the fact that lately contract manufacturers in China have to deal with a number of unprecedented cost pressures such as currency fluctuations, the VAT rebate reduction, and minimum wage enforcement. As cost pressures in China continue to mount, this paper aims to analyze whether the US manufacturing outsourcing pendulum is swinging away from China and back to nearby Mexico, or towards emerging low-cost countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey or Argentina. Design/methodology/approach - Analysis consists of comparing major cost drivers such as labor, currency, freight, and raw material and determined per unit price and the potential impact of currency fluctuations over the next five years. An example of Easle Pads (paper-based non-adhesive coated) is used to present the detailed analysis. Findings - The outsourcing landscape today may change again in the near future as the VAT rebate is further reduced or eliminated or the impact of the Olympic Games finish. Assumptions will need to be updated to reflect any changes in the future. Though other countries such as Vietnam appear to be viable options, managers will need to take other factors into consideration when making outsourcing decisions. They will need to identify specific suppliers in a country and obtain quotes in order to finalize their decision. Research limitations - The data analysis is supposedly very high-level. Many assumptions were applied lacking full detail, and duties and customs were not specifically addressed for each country. However, this organized approach is useful as a strategic decision tool in performing supplier searches to identify potential countries. Practical implications - The paper helps shed light on the opportunities that exist in the emerging low-cost countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia. Other countries, such as Turkey and Argentina, also offer low labor costs, but may be better considered as regional sources of supply, rather than US outsourcing destinations. Originality/value - The majority of studies on manufacturing outsourcing in relation to China concentrate on the reasons why one should choose China. The paper looks at manufacturing outsourcing away from China and identifies possible alternatives for contract manufacturing.","['Supply chain management', 'Outsourcing', 'Purchasing', 'Globalization', 'Budgetary control', 'Costsnan']",['outsourcing'],china outsourcing
"To answer the question of when are assets complementary, we investigate specific resource combinations along the value chain, focusing on two mechanisms that are central to combining resources for innovation in the pharmaceutical industry: recruitment and retention of star scientists, and 2) engagement in strategic alliances. We propose that resource combinations that focus on the same parts of the value chain are substitutes due to knowledge redundancies. Conversely, we hypothesize that resource combinations that link different parts of the value chain are complements due to integration of nonredundant knowledge. To test these hypotheses, we empirically track the innovative performance of 108 global pharmaceutical firms over three decades (1974-2003).

"Research summary: Emerging economies such as China enjoy economic expansion, but also face dramatic environmental challenges. China's government is a central actor in both stimulating economic activities and pursuing environmental protection. Drawing on panel data and in-depth interviews, we examined the influence of the Chinese state at multiple levels on the environmental actions of publicly listed firms. The results show that corporate environmental actions follow an inverted U-shape as control of environmental practices moves from the central government to the most decentral administrative level. This curvilinear relationship is positively moderated by the stringency of environmental regulation and negatively moderated by environmental monitoring capacity. We conclude that state influence on corporate environmental actions in China is multifaceted and subject to policy-policy decoupling. Managerial summary: As China's environmental awareness is growing, the country's government is increasingly concerned with the question as to how it can improve the environmental performance of the firms it controls. Our evidence shows the concurrence of two contravening government influences on corporate environmental practices: a performance-enhancing effect of the regulatory pressure by multiple authorities and a performance-diminishing effect of the autonomy enjoyed by local governments. Both the most centrally and the most decentrally controlled firms in China show significantly weaker environmental performance than those controlled by intermediary levels of government. The stringency of sectorial environmental regulation and environmental monitoring capacity affect the strength of the Chinese government's green grip.","['China', 'corporate environmentalism', 'environmental actions', 'environmental policy', 'government powerEMERGING ECONOMIES', 'STOCK-MARKET', 'LOCAL STATE', 'STRATEGIES', 'GOVERNANCE', 'PROTECTION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'RESPONSES', 'DYNAMICS', 'INDUSTRY']","['china', 'environmental actions', 'environmental actions', 'protection']",china state
"Drawing on substitutes for leadership theory, this study examines the relationship between a sales team manager's empowering leadership and his or her sales team's customer knowledge creation capability. The authors develop and test a model that positions task interdependence, outcome interdependence, and their interactions as substitutes for empowering leadership. Further, the authors explore two perspectives of team-level performance-customer relationship performance and financial performance-as consequences of a sales team's customer knowledge creation capability. Using matched data collected from sales team managers and sales team members, the authors find general support for their hypotheses. The study finds that a sales manager's empowering leadership has a positive effect on a sales team's customer knowledge creation capability. However, the results also suggest that the positive effect of empowering leadership on a sales team's customer knowledge creation capability is mitigated when either outcome interdependence or both task and outcome interdependence are high. Further, as outcome interdependence and the interaction between task and outcome interdependence increases, a sales team's customer knowledge creation capability also increases, which suggests that outcome interdependence and the combination of task and outcome interdependence replaces the role of empowering leadership. The study also finds that the greater a sales team's customer knowledge creation capability is, the higher its customer relationship performance and sales team financial performance will be. Implications for customer knowledge creation in sales teams in the presence and absence of empowering leadership are discussed.","['Substitutes for leadership theory', 'Sales teams', 'Empowering leadership', 'Task interdependence', 'Outcome interdependence', 'Customer knowledge creation', 'Team performancePRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAMS', 'HIGH-TECHNOLOGY FIRMS', 'LEADERSHIP SUBSTITUTES', 'EMPOWERING LEADERSHIP', 'EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'MODERATOR', 'IMPACT', 'INTERDEPENDENCE', 'COOPERATION']","['substitutes for leadership theory', 'substitutes for leadership theory', 'substitutes for leadership theory', 'substitutes for leadership theory', 'sales teams', 'sales teams', 'empowering leadership', 'empowering leadership', 'task interdependence', 'task interdependence', 'outcome interdependence', 'outcome interdependence', 'customer knowledge creation', 'customer knowledge creation', 'customer knowledge creation', 'empowering leadership', 'empowering leadership', 'interdependence']",leadership empowering leadership model task interdependence performance

"A consumer contest is a sales promotion technique that requires participants to apply certain skills as they compete for prizes or awards. This article is the first to employ a game-theoretical approach to investigate consumer contest design issues, including prize structure, segmentation, and handicapping. First, the authors find that both skill distribution and the number of contestants play an important role in determining the optimal prize structure in consumer contests. Specifically, if the skill distribution has the increasing hazard-rate property, it is optimal for a marketer to use a winner-take-all design. In large contests, for the winner-take-all approach to be optimal, it suffices to have the increasing hazard-rate property only at the high end of the skill distribution. Second, increasing contest size is beneficial to the marketer. Third, a less dispersive skill distribution leads to higher consumption by consumers at all skill levels and thus is beneficial to the marketer. The marketer may achieve less dispersive skill distributions by (1) segmenting or screening contestants according to their skill levels and (2) adopting a performance evaluation scheme that handicaps high-skilled contestants.","['nanTOURNAMENTS', 'COMPETITION', 'SALES', 'INCENTIVES', 'PRIZES', 'GAMES']","['sales', 'prizes']",sales promotion skills prize handicapping winner take all performance
"From an organizational learning perspective, we argue that the information signaled by the distribution attributes of foreign investors already operating in a location will influence the entry decisions of later arrivals by affecting their level of confidence in imitating. In the context of foreign investment decisions, the proportion of experienced firms in a location was shown to first increase a follower firm's confidence about imitating them, but then to decrease it, due to anticipated competition. The impact of learning from target organizations also varies with the experience of the learning organization.

"To develop the knowledge and skill sets of channel partner firms, manufacturers increasingly introduce learning programs as part of their relationship management strategies. However, the engagement of channel partners in these programs tends to be low. The current research, conducted in collaboration with a Fortune 100 information technology company, examines ways to strengthen learning engagement. In accordance with self-regulated learning theory, the authors propose and demonstrate that when channel partners write reviews of a learning module that they attended, beyond providing ratings, they are better able to reflect on the relevance of their learning experience and are further engaged in learning activities. The audience and focus of these written reviews determine the engagement of the channel partner sales personnel; therefore, review writing is a valuable, informal mechanism to motivate them. These effects are moderated by characteristics of both the channel partner (salesperson's learning orientation and identification with the manufacturer) and the relationship with the manufacturer (length and exclusivity).","['partner relationship management', 'self-regulated learning', 'feedback systems', 'review writingSALES FORCE', 'COMPANY IDENTIFICATION', 'GOAL ORIENTATIONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'MOTIVATION', 'OUTCOMES', 'MODEL', 'WORK', 'CONSEQUENCES']","['self regulated learning', 'self regulated learning', 'self regulated learning']",programs
"Although field-configuring events have been highlighted as catalysts of institutional change, scholars still know little about the specific conditions that allow such change to occur. Using data from a longitudinal study of United Nations climate conferences, we analyze how regular and high-stakes events in an event series interacted in producing and preventing institutional change in the transnational climate policy field. We uncover variations in event structures, processes, and outcomes that explain why climate conferences have not led to effective solutions to combat human-induced global warming. Results in particular highlight that growing field complexity and issue multiplication compromise the change potential of a field-configuring event series in favor of field maintenance. Over time, diverse actors find event participation useful for their own purposes, but their activity is not connected to the institutions at the center of the issue-based field. In discussing how events configuring a field are purposefully staged and enacted but also influenced by developments in the field, our study contributes to a more complete understanding of field-configuring events, particularly in contested transnational policy arenas.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL FIELDS', 'INSTITUTIONAL FIELDS', 'PATH DEPENDENCE', 'TOURNAMENT RITUALS', 'SIDE-EVENTS', 'PROJECT', 'TIME', 'GOVERNANCE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'INDUSTRY']",['time'],field configuring climate conferences policy global warming

"Much of the literature dedicated to the analysis of entry timing decisions has been devoted to the study of their consequences in terms of performance. However, only a limited amount of effort has been dedicated to analyzing the factors that determine these decisions. In addition, previous papers have centered their efforts on the product dimension, paying no attention to entry into new geographical markets. This paper departs from previous works in this respect and extends the entry timing literature through a consideration of the geographical side of entry. Our analysis shows that organizational size, organizational competence, and organizational experience appear as key factors when explaining the pattern of geographic diversification.

"This study investigates how the information context of cross-border exchanges influences the implementation and effectiveness of export pricing policies. Using a disaggregate approach to measure export pricing, the research shows the influence of the competitive intensity and the ambiguity of the foreign market on each facet of the pricing policy. In addition, this research investigates the effectiveness of these price manipulations in a context of information asymmetry. The findings suggest that exporters manipulate prices when confronted with competitive and ambiguous foreign markets. However, in most cases, these price manipulations have no impact on performance. Furthermore, when information asymmetry is high, export price manipulations deteriorate performance.

"This study empirically investigates marketing department power in U.S. firms throughout 1993-2008 and assesses its impact on firm performance. Using a new objective measure of marketing department power and a cross-industry sample of 612 public firms in the United States, the results reveal that, in general, marketing department power increased during this time period. Furthermore, the analyses show that a powerful marketing department enhances firms' longer-term future total shareholder returns beyond its positive effect on firms' short-term return on assets (ROA). The findings also reveal that a firm's long-run market-based-asset-building and short-run market-based-asset-leveraging capabilities partially mediate the effect of a firm's marketing department power on its longer-term shareholder value performance and fully mediate the effect on its short-term ROA performance. This research provides new insights for marketing scholars and managers with regard to both marketing's influence within the firm and how investments in building a powerful marketing department affect firm performance.","['marketing department power', 'marketing capabilities', 'shareholder value', 'firm performanceINTRAORGANIZATIONAL POWER', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'CAPABILITIES', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'SALES', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'ORIENTATION', 'PERSISTENCE', 'CORPORATE', 'CUSTOMER']","['marketing department power', 'marketing department power', 'marketing department power', 'shareholder value', 'shareholder value', 'capabilities']",marketing department power firm performance roa

"Research on entrepreneurial risk taking by family firms has grown rapidly over the past decade. In this article, I revisit my earlier study's objectives and contributions and analyze the key changes that have taken place in the literature since its publication. My analyses highlight the ever-broadening definition of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial risk taking by family firms and the explosive growth of research on their antecedents and consequences, increasingly adopting an international perspective. I offer suggestions to improve theory building and methodological choices while adopting a multilevel perspective that enables the recognition of microfoundations and temporal issues. This research can clarify the role of entrepreneurship as the source of family firms' regenerative capability.","['entrepreneurship', 'risk taking', 'capability', 'regenerative capabilityDYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'ORIENTATION', 'OWNERSHIP', 'PERFORMANCE', 'BUSINESS', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'ENTERPRISE', 'MICROFOUNDATIONS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'MANAGEMENT']","['entrepreneurship', 'risk taking', 'risk taking', 'capability', 'microfoundations', 'perspective']",entrepreneurial risk taking firms

In general, we found the papers are not immediately useful to practitioners; however, the papers of a theory conference should not necessarily be immediately useful to practitioners. We identify several areas for future research, which include the development of a concrete definition for family business, a thorough analysis of the positive and negative effects of the concept of familiness, a close look at failed family business, as well as other issues.","['nanFIRMS', 'FAMILINESS']",['familiness'],familiness
"We investigate the relative importance of external market knowledge acquisition and internal knowledge generation in new venture innovation. We argue that the effectiveness of externally acquired knowledge is less important in environments that are perceived as highly dynamic. To test our model, we examine 316 new ventures in one singular, high-growth sector. We find that managers have different interpretations of dynamism within this single sector and that these perceptual variations have important implications for how new ventures develop knowledge in pursuit of innovation. In so doing, we illustrate important within-sector mechanisms and boundary conditions behind new venture knowledge development and innovation.","['New venture innovation', 'Knowledge', 'Dynamism', 'Sector', 'Managerial perceptionsORIENTATION-PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIP', 'COMMON METHOD VARIANCE', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'FIRMS', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL', 'CAPABILITIES', 'TECHNOLOGY']","['new venture innovation', 'new venture innovation', 'new venture innovation', 'knowledge', 'dynamism', 'sector']",model
"This paper argues that ambiguity of context manifested in pressures for legitimacy and commitment affect planning processes. Ambiguity arises from multiple conflicting constituencies and the lack of direct control over resources. Using nonprofit and entrepreneurial organizations as examples of organizations facing ambiguous contents, we examine their planning practices to develop an understanding of the relationship between commitment legitimacy, and planning. From this analysis, we articulate a managerial dilemma: the need to use informality and vagueness to gain commitment from diverse interests, and the need to demonstrate formalization of managerial practices to acquire legitimacy from critical resource suppliers. Using elements of this dilemma, we present a new planning framework for organizations in ambiguous contexts that recognizes planning as a strategy for resource acquisition rather than a strategy for resource allocation.","['planning', 'nonprofit organizations', 'entrepreneurial firms', 'commitment', 'legitimacyFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'SMALL BUSINESS', 'GROWTH', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'FIRMS', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'INDUSTRY']","['planning', 'commitment', 'organizations']",organizations
"This study presents an empirical analysis of the micro-dynamics of institutional work. Examining the corporatization' of large international law firm partnerships, the study identifies the dyadic relationship that develops between two different types of professionals, the managing partner and management professional, and demonstrates how their relationship becomes a key mechanism for institutional work. The study shows how, by working together, these individuals take advantage of differences in their relative social positions: specifically their formal authority, specialist expertise, and social capital. The study identifies seven forms of institutional work in which they engage and demonstrates how these multiple forms simultaneously encompass the creation, maintenance, and disruption of the institution of partnership. The study argues that this simultaneous occurrence helps to account for the phenomenon of sedimentation, whereby the gradually emerging institutional logic of the corporatized partnership is being integrated into the traditional partnership form.","['institutional work', 'lawyers', 'management professionals', 'professional partnershipLARGE LAW FIRMS', 'SOCIAL SKILL', 'INTERNATIONALIZATION', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'ACTORS', 'MYTH']","['institutional work', 'institutional work']",institutional work law social

It explores the value of interaction frequency as a performance measure in IJV research and the role of relationship commitment as a key predictor. Cross-cultural adaptation and relational norms are introduced into the commitment-interaction chain because they may reduce cultural dissimilarity and enhance bilateralism, which in turn may promote ongoing interaction. The model is tested empirically using LISREL on U.S.-Chinese IJVs. The results show that relationship commitment positively predicts IJV interaction frequency and cross-cultural adaptation.

"This paper presents a model of cross-cultural negotiations which describes how the affect negotiators experience during negotiations influences the character of the negotiation process and its outcomes. Three categories of determinants of negotiator affect are proposed: Individual differences, cross-cultural differences, and contextual factors. The ways in which negotiator affect influences information processing during negotiations are then described. It is suggested that the influence of affect, through substantive information processing, may lead to either positive or negative Spirals in negotiations, influencing the ability of negotiators to reach an integrative solution. Finally, the ways in which negotiators can break out of destructive negative spirals by engaging in motivated rather than substantive information processing are discussed.","['nanMOOD-INCONGRUENT RECALL', 'FACIAL EXPRESSIONS', 'NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL LIFE', 'PERSON-PERCEPTION', 'POSITIVE AFFECT', '5-FACTOR MODEL', 'EXPERIENCE', 'EMOTION', 'SELF']",['experience'],outcomes determinants individual differences
"Do international acquisitions increase acquirers' risk? If so, can cross-border uncertainties interact and offset such risk? The perspective of integrated risk management suggests international acquirers could mitigate their overall risk through the interplay of various levels of uncertainties. Using asset pricing to measure shifts in risk and a large sample of international acquisitions by US firms during 2000-2014, we find that acquirers can reduce their risk by trading internal and deal-level risk factors (information asymmetry and moral hazard) off against external and country-level risk factors (liability of foreignness and double-layered acculturation).","['Risk', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'International', 'Cultural distance', 'Institutional distanceINSTITUTIONAL DISTANCE', 'FINANCIAL RATIOS', 'ACQUISITIONS', 'MERGERS', 'STOCK', 'FIRM', 'MANAGEMENT', 'EVENT', 'US', 'DETERMINANTS']","['risk', 'international', 'acquisitions', 'firm', 'management', 'us']",international liability of foreignness
"The allegiance of a particular customer, and the distribution across customers of strength of affiliation to a store are important indicators of store health. It is therefore important to understand the extent and determinants of shopper mobility among competing retailers. While shoppers often patronize many stores, they typically have a primary affiliation to a main store that captures the majority of their purchases. We examine, in detail, the tendencies of shoppers to transition away from the current main store and adopt another in its place. That is, rather than study all types of store switching behavior, we focus on the decision to change primary allegiance. The model is established in a discrete time hazard framework and estimated as random-effects probit. Data from 548 households taking 88,945 shopping trips among five stores are used to calibrate the model. We find that state dependence is prevalent with nearly three quarters of the shoppers showing progressive attachment to their current main store. Interestingly, this finding is not simply driven by location (i.e., because shoppers are captive to a single store based on geographical distance). More likely, shoppers are unwilling to give up the benefits of store-specific knowledge of assortment, layout and prices. Second, the decision to transition from a current maiti store is not influenced by temporary price promotions on a common basket of items: Shoppers will cherry-pick, but this alone does not cause them to change primary allegiance. The majority of transitions occur across competing stores of the same price format, which suggests format loyalty is an important aspect of shopper behavior. After controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, we find little relationship between observable demographics and the transition probability. We do, however, find that shoppers who spend more per trip are less likely to change main stores, as are less frequent shoppers. Implications for retail management strategy are discussed.

"Purpose - To examine whether upstream firms in the food chain are knowledgeable about end-users or consumers and to identify factors that might influence their acquisition of such knowledge. Design/methodology/approach - A cross-disciplinary approach is used to gain theoretical insights into the research questions. Consumer knowledge and influencing factors are revealed through an empirical study of producer and exporter firms in the Norwegian salmon farming industry. The study focuses on managerial knowledge of how consumers perceive the importance of the colour and texture of flesh and the fat content of salmon. Findings - A relatively large proportion of the managers are not knowledgeable about consumers' quality perceptions. Closeness to consumers in the form of sales to the respective markets, or downstream location in the food chain, do not appear to improve knowledge. A differentiation strategy is not associated with more accurate consumer knowledge. Research limitations/implications - The study focuses on knowledge of a limited aspect of consumers' quality evaluation only and important chain actors such as retailers were not included in the study. Upstream firms pursuing a quality-based differentiation strategy must take into account the fact that not all consumers are willing to pay a price premium for high quality, and that those who do might use surrogate indicators to infer quality. Originality/value - The paper addresses the important but little researched area of distribution of end-user knowledge in the food chain. It investigates reasons why and when upstream actors will benefit from end-user knowledge.","['fish (Food)', 'fish farming', 'quality awareness', 'consumer behaviour', 'NorwayEMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION', 'PRODUCT EVALUATIONS', 'SUPPLY CHAIN', 'INFORMATION', 'MARKET', 'PRICE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'DISTORTION', 'ACCURATE', 'LEMONS']","['market', 'price', 'accurate']",food chain
"As cause marketing promotions become more prevalent, retailers must develop an increasing understanding of how consumers evaluate such offers. Using attribution theory and the gift-giving literature, we derive four predictions about conditions that may lead cause-marketing efforts to be evaluated more positively. The conditions are donation situation (disaster vs. ongoing cause), congruency of donations with the firm's core business, effort exerted by the firm, and commitment of the firm to the cause. We employed an experiment to test our expectations across two retail contexts: grocery and building supply stores. Across both stores, respondent evaluations were more positive for disaster-related as compared to ongoing causes, and for donations involving greater effort (i.e., product rather than cash contributions). There were no differences in evaluations related to the firm's degree of commitment (i.e., the retailer matching vs. not matching consumers' donations). This was surprising because the greater commitment condition doubled the contribution to the cause. Differences between stores were found for congruency of the donated product with the retailer's core business. For grocery stores, there was no difference; however for the building supply store, consumers rated the incongruent product donation (i.e., food and cleaning supplies) more positively than the congruent donation (i.e., building supplies).","['nanCONSUMER', 'PROMOTION']",['promotion'],cause marketing promotions attribution theory gift giving marketing efforts

"Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has become a key method in international marketing research. Users of PLS-SEM have, however, largely overlooked the issue of endogeneity, which has become an integral component of regression analysis applications. This lack of attention is surprising because the PLS-SEM method is grounded in regression analysis, for which numerous approaches for handling endogeneity have been proposed. To identify and treat endogeneity, and create awareness of how to deal with this issue, this study introduces a systematic procedure that translates control variables, instrumental variables, and Gaussian copulas into a PLS-SEM framework. We illustrate the procedure's efficacy by means of empirical data and offer recommendations to guide international marketing researchers on how to effectively address endogeneity concerns in their PLS-SEM analyses.","['control variable', 'endogeneity', 'Gaussian copula', 'instrumental variable', 'partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM)INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES', 'CORPORATE REPUTATION', 'SWITCHING BARRIERS', 'GENERALIZED-METHOD', 'COMMON BELIEFS', 'PLS-SEM', 'SPECIFICATION', 'ISSUES', 'TESTS', 'BIAS']","['control variable', 'control variable', 'endogeneity', 'gaussian copula', 'gaussian copula', 'instrumental variable', 'instrumental variable', 'pls sem', 'pls sem']",partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem endogeneity copulas analyses
"We examine the practice of nominating bicultural immigrants to manage knowledge-intensive projects sourced from their host to their home countries. We focus on their actions vis-a-vis global collaborators and unpack psychological processes involved. Managers in these positions have to navigate the workplace social identity threat that arises from being associated with the home country group - a lower status group in this context. How they navigate this threat shapes the way they use their bicultural competencies and authority as managers. When they embrace their home country identity, immigrant managers tend to enable knowledge-based boundary spanning through actions empowering home country collaborators, such as teaching missing competencies, connecting to important stakeholders, and soliciting input. Instead, when distancing from their home country identity, they tend to hinder collaborators by micromanaging, narrowing communication channels, and suppressing input. We develop theoretical implications for the study of global boundary spanning, bicultural managers, and workplace social identity.","['biculturals', 'cross-cultural collaboration', 'global boundary spanning', 'offshoring', 'qualitative research', 'social identityQUALITATIVE RESEARCH', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'SUBGROUP DYNAMICS', 'ROLE STRESS', 'LANGUAGE', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'FRAMEWORK', 'MODEL', 'WORK', 'CAPABILITIES']","['global boundary spanning', 'global boundary spanning', 'global boundary spanning', 'work']",immigrants social identity boundary
"Both the size and the rapid growth of global exporting have focused the attention of marketing researchers on the factors associated with firms' export performance. However, knowledge of this increasingly important domain of marketing activity remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, the authors draw on the strategy and marketing literature to develop an integrative theory of the antecedents of export venture performance. The interplay among available resources and capabilities, competitive strategy decisions, and competitive intensity determines export venture positional advantages and performance outcomes in the theoretical model. The authors empirically assess predicted relationships using survey data from 287 export ventures. Results broadly support the theoretical model, indicating that resources and capabilities affect export venture competitive strategy choices and the positional advantages achieved in the export market, which in turn affect export venture performance outcomes. In contrast to structure-conduct-performance theory predictions, the data indicate that the competitive intensity of the export marketplace does not have a direct effect on export venture positional advantages or performance. However, competitive intensity moderates the relationship between export venture competitive strategy choices and the positional advantages realized.","['nanRESOURCE-BASED THEORY', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'STRATEGY', 'FIRM', 'FRAMEWORK', 'CAPABILITIES', 'ASSETS', 'ENVIRONMENT']","['strategy', 'firm', 'capabilities']",strategy capabilities competitive strategy choices
"This article offers a cognitive account of the means versus ends focus of environmental regulation. The first of two studies suggests that standards (the means) exert an influence on judgments of proposed environmental solutions that is independent of the extent to which those solutions protect the environment (the ends). Standard-based decisions produce cognitive distortions, artificially enhancing the attractiveness of standard-conforming solutions over that of nonconforming solutions. Our second study suggests that means solutions tend to be preferred over ends solutions when one environmental proposal is examined. This pattern of preference can be reversed through the simultaneous evaluation of two proposals.","['nanMULTIPLE REFERENCE POINTS', 'INTRINSIC MOTIVATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'DECISIONS', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'BIAS']",['decisions'],decisions
"Given the inherent risk of innovative activity. firms can improve the odds of success by pursuing multiple parallel objectives. Because innovation draws on many sources of ideas, firms also may improve their odds of successful innovation by accessing a large number of knowledge sources. In this study, we conduct one of the first firm-level statistical analyses of the impact on innovation of breadth in both innovation objectives and knowledge sources. The empirical results suggest that broader horizons with respect to innovation objectives and knowledge sources are associated with successful innovation. We do not find diminishing returns to breadth in innovation objectives, which suggests that firms may tend to search too narrowly.

"In the 20 years since the last review on organizational decline and turnaround, the scope of turnaround research has expanded dramatically; however, research on this phenomenon remains empirically and theoretically fragmented. Recent research has incorporated managerial cognition, strategic leadership, and stakeholder management and has identified simultaneous and complex resource-based actions beyond the two-stage model developed in the last review by Pearce and Robbins two decades ago. Thus, herein we build from Pearce and Robbins' review by cataloguing the past 20 years of empirical evidence related to turnaround, developing a descriptive model of organizational decline and turnaround, and concluding with a theory-based research agenda for organizational decline and turnaround. In doing so, this article summarizes what we know about organizational decline and turnaround, and proposes what we need to study, while providing a theoretical road map to guide this future research.","['organizational turnaround', 'organizational decline', 'firm failureCORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE', 'BOARD COMPOSITION', 'MANAGERIAL RISK', 'LOW PERFORMANCE', 'FIRM', 'BANKRUPTCY', 'STRATEGIES', 'RETRENCHMENT']","['organizational decline', 'organizational decline']",decline turnaround management
"Because customers' assessment of services is based on performances rather than objects, they rely on the numerous clues that are embedded in performance when choosing services and evaluating service experiences. Indeed, it is often small clues that influence a customer's overall perception of an experience. Customers form perceptions based on the technical performance of the service (functional clues), the tangibles associated with the service (mechanic clues), and the behavior and appearance of service providers (humanic clues). Functional, mechanic, and humanic clues play specific roles in creating the customer's service experience, influencing both rational and emotional perceptions of service quality. Clearly and consistently designing and orchestrating clues is a critical management responsibility; businesses need to be clue conscious and add clue management to their job descriptions.","['nanBACKGROUND MUSIC', 'POSITIVE AFFECT', 'BEHAVIOR']",['behavior'],service quality
"This paper examines how functional and line-management stakeholders evaluate operational human resource management capabilities in multinational corporation (MNC) subsidiaries. We suggest that such evaluations are a function of two key structural factors: (1) that focal subsidiary human resource (HR) departments respond differentially to the expectations of differently located stakeholders; and (2) that the structural position of the stakeholder determines what cues he or she relies upon to construct the evaluation. Our findings show that the focal HR subsidiary department is likely to exert more effort towards meeting the expectations of line-management stakeholders, and we suggest that this is a function of line management's co-location with the focal HR department. Second, we find that co-located line-management stakeholders are more likely to rely on experience-based cues when constructing evaluations, whereas headquarters-located functional stakeholders tend to rely on cognition-based evaluation, driven by their ability to compare across different subsidiary HR departments. We contribute to the literature by going beyond existing research that has tended to focus on evaluation from the perspective of organizational behavior, by providing a structural perspective on capability evaluation in MNCs that combines the insights of role theory and cognitive choice heuristics.","['human resource management (HRM)', 'capabilities and capability development', 'multinational corporations (MNCs)', 'multilevel analysisRESOURCE MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES', 'EXECUTIVES PERCEPTIONS', 'FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES', 'WORK PRACTICES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EXPLORATION', 'ATTENTION', 'SEARCH', 'MODEL', 'VIEW']",['search'],line management experience cognitive choice heuristics
"Business scholars and managers stress the importance of achieving and sustaining competitive advantage as a critical strategic step in enabling superior firm performance. Yet which types of competitive advantage may yield the best performance outcomes-and what contingency factorsmay affect this-remains largely unexplored. This article examines the contribution of price, product, and service advantages to market performance in international ventures. Applying customer value logic to the literature on value creation and value capture, the authors posit that the symmetric achievement of all pairs of advantages leads to increased market performance. The findings confirm this conjecture, while for the product-service advantage pairing, even asymmetry in achievement has a positivemarket performance effect when the asymmetry is toward service. Using primary data from a sample of U.K. manufacturing exporters, the authors find that price advantage has a direct positive effect on market performance, while the strong positive effect of service advantage is further strengthened (and the nonsignificant effect of product advantage becomes negative) when the distributor has high-quality relationships with the overseas customers and there is available production capacity, even in technologically turbulent environments.","['competitive advantage', 'product quality', 'service advantage', 'market performance', 'value creationRESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'EXPORT VENTURE PERFORMANCE', 'BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS', 'DEMAND-BASED PERSPECTIVE', 'HIGH-TECH MARKETS', 'VALUE CREATION', 'CUSTOMER VALUE', 'VALUE CAPTURE', 'BUSINESS MARKETS', 'CHANNEL RELATIONSHIPS']","['competitive advantage', 'competitive advantage', 'service advantage', 'service advantage', 'market performance', 'market performance', 'value creation', 'value creation', 'customer value', 'customer value', 'value capture', 'value capture']",competitive advantage firm performance value creation

A key finding is that those located at the periphery perceived critical entrepreneurial resources and access to markets less favorably than their counterparts at the core, but surprisingly, they perceived greater business opportunity in their area. A further survey of 2,200 respondents concerning actual entrepreneurial activities among the total adult population revealed no differences between peripheral and core regions.

"Attributional complexity refers to the capability of discriminating and integrating dimensions related to social judgment in order to understand social behaviour. While previous leadership research has examined the role of leader attributions, it has neglected the role of attributional complexity. We theorize and find support for a relationship between higher attributional complexity and transformational leadership behaviours, based on a sample of 100 leaders and their direct reports. Leaders who were more complex in their social judgments, attributing complex external and internal causes to others' behaviours and actions, were seen as more transformational by their direct reports. Our findings suggest that attributional complexity is a construct that warrants consideration in future research on both transformational leadership and leadership attributions.","['attribution', 'attributional complexity', 'transformational leadershipTRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE', 'AUTHENTIC LEADERSHIP', 'MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'PERSONALITY', 'SELF', 'EMPOWERMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FOLLOWERS', 'BEHAVIORS']","['attribution', 'attributional complexity', 'attributional complexity']",attributions

"Research on firm performance after the introduction of a radical technological change has primarily concerned itself with differences between incumbents and entrants. This paper explores other factors that may influence firm performance over the longer term after a radical change-specifically, those related to product line management strategy. Following a radical change, a period of incremental technological change typically creates the opportunity for rapid development of new products. In such settings, strategies to manage multiple products, including families of related products that can be derived front a common platform, may be expected to impact competitive performance, especially over the longer term. The data for the study are front the telecommunications switching sector, specifically the private branch exchange (PBX) industry. Fifty-six firms and over 240 new products were analyzed over 22 years. This study shows that incumbent-entrant-based explanations of firm performance are incomplete. In particular, the results demonstrate that product line strategy explains significant additional variation in firm performance. The paper tests hypotheses linking both overall product line strategy and product platform strategy to firm performance. It finds that overall product introduction rates and product longevity can be linked to performance. It also shows that decomposing overall strategy, into product platform strategy-rates of platform and derivative introduction, and platform longevity-can further increase explanatory power. In total, the results indicate that strategic prescriptions in the literature that emphasize development speed alone are oversimplified. They also suggest that differences in how relationships among products derived from a common platform are managed can contribute to competitive advantage and demand complex trade-offs Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.","['product line strategy', 'radical technological change', 'firm performance', 'product familyINNOVATION', 'INDUSTRY', 'MARKET', 'ADVANTAGE', 'DESIGN', 'ENTRY', 'CAPABILITY', 'MODULARITY', 'INCUMBENT', 'EVOLUTION']","['product line strategy', 'product line strategy', 'product line strategy', 'radical technological change', 'radical technological change', 'radical technological change', 'firm performance', 'firm performance', 'industry', 'advantage', 'incumbent']",management impact platform

"Our stakeholder synergy perspective identifies new value creation opportunities that are especially effective strategically because a single strategic action (1) increases different types of value for two or more essential stakeholder groups simultaneously, and (2) does not reduce the value already received by any other essential stakeholder group. This result is obtainable because multiple potential sources of value creation exist for each essential stakeholder group.

"Employing a sample of 180 entrepreneurial high-technology ventures based in the United Kingdom, we examine the effects of social capital in key customer relationships on knowledge acquisition and knowledge exploitation. Building on the relational view and on social capital and knowledge-based theories, we propose that social capital facilitates external knowledge aquisition in key customer relationships and that such knowledge mediates the relationship between social capital and knowledge exploitation for competitive advantage. Our results indicate that the social interaction and network ties dimensions of social capital are indeed associated with greater knowledge acquisition, but that the relationship quality dimension is negatively associated with knowledge acquisition. Knowledge acquisition is, in turn, positively associated with knowledge exploitation for competitive advantage through new product development, technological distinctiveness, and sales cost efficiency. Further our results provide evidence that knowledge acquisition plays a mediating role between social capital and knowledge exploitation.

"Social capital refers to the resources derived from social relationships. Although the concept of social capital has been applied at the individual, group, and organizational levels of analysis, researchers have yet to fully embrace social capital's potential as a multilevel lens through which we might better understand management and organizational phenomena. With a central objective of advancing social capital's potential as a multilevel theoretical perspective, the authors make two contributions to the management literature. First, the authors comprehensively review two decades of management research to highlight how social capital has been empirically applied across levels of analysis. Second, based on the shortcomings and challenges revealed through the literature review, the authors identify and discuss avenues for future multilevel research, including suggestions for both macro and micro researchers.","['social capital', 'networks', 'embeddedness', 'multilevel research', 'research methodsINSTITUTION-BASED VIEW', 'RELATIONAL EMBEDDEDNESS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-RESEARCH', 'STRUCTURAL HOLES', 'PAST ACCOMPLISHMENTS', 'CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK', 'NETWORK STRUCTURES', 'EMERGING MARKET', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'PERFORMANCE']","['social capital', 'social capital', 'multilevel research', 'multilevel research']",social capital management
"Core self-evaluation (CSE) represents the fundamental appraisals individuals make about their self-worth and capabilities. CSE is conceptualized as a higher order construct composed of broad and evaluative traits (e.g., self-esteem and generalized self-efficacy). The authors review 15 years of CSE theory and research, focusing in particular on the outcomes, mediators, and moderators of CSE via qualitative and quantitative literature reviews. Meta-analytic results support the relation of CSE with various outcomes, including job and life satisfaction, in-role and extra-role job performance, and perceptions of the work environment (e.g., job characteristics and fairness). The authors conclude with a critical evaluation of CSE theory, measurement, and construct validity, highlighting areas of promise and concern for future CSE research. Key topics requiring further research include integrating CSE within an approach/avoidance framework, ruling out alternative explanations for the emergence of the higher order construct, testing the possibility of intraindividual change in CSE, evaluating the usefulness of CSE for staffing and performance management, and moving beyond CSE to also consider core external evaluations.","['core self-evaluation', 'personality', 'meta-analysis', 'motivation', 'job attitudes', 'job performanceJOB-SATISFACTION', 'LIFE SATISFACTION', 'AVOIDANCE MOTIVATION', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONSTRUCTS', 'EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE', 'PERFORMANCE-APPRAISAL', 'METHOD VARIANCE', 'REPORTED AFFECT', 'MODERATING ROLE']","['core self evaluation', 'core self evaluation', 'core self evaluation', 'life satisfaction', 'life satisfaction']",core self evaluation self esteem efficacy outcomes
"The recession of 1990-1991 adversely affected nearly every industry in the United States, and entrepreneurial manufacturing firms were among those hardest hit by the recession. The failure rate among this group by mid-year 1991 had risen 37% from the previous year. Thus, recessions pose a serious threat to the survival of entrepreneurial firms. Understanding how the business cycle influences performance and what strategies are effective in such turbulent rimes has practical value for managers of entrepreneurial firms. In this paper we report a large-scale empirical research study involving subjective and financial information from 118 publicly traded U.S. manufacturing firms. The participating firms are involved in technologically demanding and highly innovative industry segments: Industrial and Computer Equipment; Electrical Equipment and Components; and Measuring Analysis, and Control Instruments. None of the firms has achieved a market share of more than one half of one percent (< 0.5%). The goal of the study was to determine the components of a marketing strategy that enabled a firm in these industries to withstand the negative financial consequences of a recession. We find that, in these industries, a company's marketing strategies preceding a recession strongly impact the extent of economic downturn on the firm, and influence its odds of a timely and complete recovery. Our specific prescriptions follow: First, maintain marketing activities in the core business as assurance against recession. Increasing sales and advertising, increasing breadth of production, and increasing geographic coverage improve performance during both the peak and the contraction of the business cycle. Second, during the peak period, cautiously expand with an emphasis on marketing efficiency. Increasing the number of channels of distribution and cutting price have a negative effect unless accompanied by sales-force performance measurement. A simple emphasis on incentives and efficiency alone hurts a firm as a recession hits. All of these prescriptions run counter to existing views that suggest that recession simply requires cutbacks and retrenchment. Recessions seem to be different from other threats to firm viability, and marketing activities appear to help pull the firm through a macroeconomic downturn.

"This paper examines the impact of acquisitions on the subsequent innovation performance of acquiring firms in the chemicals industry. We distinguish between technological acquisitions, acquisitions in which technology is a component of the acquired firm's assets, and nontechnological acquisitions: acquisitions that do not involve a technological component. We develop a framework relating acquisitions to firm innovation performance and develop a set of measures for quantifying the technological inputs a firm obtains through acquisitions. We find that within technological acquisitions absolute size of the acquired knowledge base enhances innovation performance, while relative size of the acquired knowledge base reduces innovation output. The relatedness of acquired and acquiring knowledge bases has a nonlinear impart on innovation output. Nontechnological acquisitions do nor have a significant effect on subsequent innovation output.

We compare these direct measures from Indonesia with those from a developed country, the United States, to gauge the degree to which the culture of this emerging economy remains stable despite strong foreign influences. Utilizing English and back-translated Indonesian language versions of the 1994 Values Survey Module, we find statistically significant support for a narrowing of the differences in these two cultural dimensions between Indonesian and U.S. managers compared to earlier findings by Hofstede (1991).","['nanNATIONAL CULTURE', 'UNITED-STATES', 'ISSUES', 'IMPACT', 'VALUES']","['united states', 'united states', 'values']",culture collectivism

"This paper theorizes about why discoveries of corporate deviance that damage the legitimacy of the responsible organization may also have consequences for other organizations. We propose that audiences generalize from deviance by one organization to others that are similar. The result is a withdrawal from transactions even from non-culpable organizations as audiences seek to avoid organizations that they associate with a deviant act. We show that two scandals involving Skandia AB, a Swedish insurance firm that had a subsidiary offering mutual funds, affected mutual fund providers owned by other insurance firms in 2000-2004, as well as mutual fund subsidiaries of other firms with similar characteristics. The effect was greatest for firms more similar to Skandia and firms owning real estate, which was the context for one of the scandals. Thus audience members' categorization rules lead to spread of legitimacy loss in response to an isolated act of organizational deviance.","['nanEMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION', 'SECURITIES ANALYSTS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'INFORMATION', 'MODEL', 'MEDIA', 'FALL', 'NEWS', 'ACCOUNTABILITY', 'COMMUNICATION']",['consequences'],deviance legitimacy categorization

"We contribute to IB literature on state-owned multinationals by examining an understudied element of MNE strategy - transparency. Drawing insight from accounting, finance, and political science, we develop theory and hypotheses regarding ownership effects on FDI disclosure. We argue that transparency of outward FDI depends on both state ownership and home and host country institutions. We also posit that host governments harness their SOEs to exploit information disclosed by foreign MNEs, discouraging inward FDI transparency. We test our hypotheses using a unique transaction-level database from the global petroleum industry. Analyzing a sample of 965 investment disclosures across 81 developing and developed countries, we find state ownership reduces MNE transparency; SOEs are less sensitive to host country political risk than private firms; SOEs from better-governed countries are more transparent; and regardless of ownership, foreign MNEs are more opaque when investing in the presence of a host country SOE.","['state ownership', 'transparency', 'voluntary disclosure', 'political risk', 'institutionsVOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE', 'INFORMATION ASYMMETRY', 'OWNED ENTERPRISES', 'POLITICAL RISK', 'PRIVATE', 'DETERMINANTS', 'INSTITUTIONS', 'FIRMS', 'PRIVATIZATION', 'GOVERNANCE']","['state ownership', 'state ownership', 'transparency', 'political risk', 'political risk', 'political risk', 'political risk', 'private', 'institutions', 'firms']",multinationals transparency investment disclosures

Specifically, by integrating international business research with social identity theory, we hypothesized that shared vision mediates the positive effect between host country national employees' corporate language proficiency and reverse knowledge transfer. Furthermore, we hypothesized that headquarters-subsidiary communication frequency enhances the relationships between language proficiency and shared vision as well as shared vision and reverse knowledge transfer. We tested these effects on data collected from 574 middle managers leading functional departments of foreign subsidiaries in Japan. Our findings supported these hypotheses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

"An enduring concern within management and organization studies (MOS) is how to conduct research from perspectives deemed 'alternatives' to those of functionalism and positivism. Our aim is to address this concern with regard to an approach employed by Karen Legge in research on knowledge workers, namely that of actor-network theory (ANT) (or the 'sociology of translation'). Following an introduction to ANT, the views of some its key proponents, and Legge's own use of the approach, the paper presents critical notes on five issues related to the production of ANT accounts - the inclusion and exclusion of actors; the treatment of humans and non-humans; the nature of privileging and status; the handling of agency and structure; and the nature of politics and power in 'heterogeneous engineering'. We discuss the relationships between these issues and the key ANT goal of achieving a sense of 'general symmetry' in the accounting process. In so doing we note how ANT authors are frequently chastised for either failing to take sufficient account of, or promoting too strong a sense of, analytical symmetry in their writing. It is argued that the primary challenge facing ANT researchers is to produce accounts that are robust enough to negate the twin charges of symmetrical absence and symmetrical absurdity.","['nanINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY', 'WORK']",['work'],management organization knowledge

"Why do customers' attitudinal loyalty fail to predict their behavior? More importantly, what creates such latent loyalty? We attempt to answer these questions by examining the antecedents and outcomes of loyalty conviction, which represents the inherent strength/uncertainty in a customer's attitudinal loyalty. For deep attitudinal loyalty (i.e., conative loyalty), the findings suggest that customer satisfaction creates loyalty held without conviction. In contrast, customer-company identification creates loyalty held with conviction. Importantly, attitudinal loyalty without conviction loses its ability to predict behavior when situational and competitive barriers are present whereas loyalty with conviction maintains a predictive relationship with behavior despite the same barriers.

"Political risk not only constitutes a threat for multinational enterprises but can also be a source of opportunities. Exposure to and accumulated experience dealing with political risk allows firms to better implement a wide set of political actions such as negotiation of entry conditions, lobbying, litigation, campaign contributions and coalition formation, leading to preferential conditions, reduced environmental uncertainty, reduced transaction costs and increased long-term sustainability to the firm. These advantages facilitate investments in countries with higher and more diverse levels of risk and make political risk to be positively associated with the firm's scope of internationalization. This effect is not homogeneous across firms. Drawing from a sample of 164 Spanish companies with investments in 119 countries, we find that the impact is greater for companies in industrial sectors that are the object of greater governmental regulation than it is for firms in non-regulated manufacturing or service sectors, with less frequent interactions with home and host-country institutions.

"Managers use mental models of markets to simplify and impose order on complex and ambiguous competitive environments and isolate points of competitive advantage or deficiency. In this study of senior managers of 190 businesses, the authors found four different types of mental models or representations of competitive advantage, varying in the emphasis placed on customer or management judgments about where and how competitors differ. These representations were influenced equally by pressure points in the environment and choice of strategy. The type of representation was also strongly associated with constrained patterns of information search and usage, raising the possibility that the necessary simplifications and narrowing of perspective may come at the cost of myopia and insensitivity to challenges from unexpected directions. There was also a strong association between the completeness of the managerial representation and relative financial performance, which supports related studies on the profitability of a market orientation.","['nanSTRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'COGNITION', 'MODELS', 'LEVEL']","['market orientation', 'market orientation', 'models']",performance orientation
"The feminist notion of an ethic of care provides a powerful alternative to justice as a central orienting value for the development of moral theory, but it has been largely overlooked in the literature on care in organizations. We explore how an ethic of care could be enacted in organizations, arguing that it would involve narrative practices embedded in enduring relationships, such as work teams. We articulate three domains of discursive practice-how members construct their experiences, how they construct their struggles, and how they construct future-oriented stories-and from them identify three specific caring narrative practices: constructing histories of sparkling moments, contextualizing struggles, and constructing polyphonic future-oriented stories. We argue that, together, these practices foster an ontology of possibility-a belief system that emphasizes the socially constructed nature of both past and present and, thus, facilitates action and an appreciation of its limits. We conclude by considering the organizational conditions under which an ethic of care is more likely to flourish and the impact of an ontology of possibility on the resilience of organizational teams who adopt it.","['nanGROUP POTENCY', 'STORYTELLING ORGANIZATION', 'RESILIENCE', 'COMPASSION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'WORK', 'TEAM', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'HOPE']","['resilience', 'work', 'team']",ethic care narrative
"New business models combined with a lack of objective operating data result in significant information asymmetry and uncertainty in the valuation of new firms in emerging markets. Information asymmetry increases the risks of both adverse selection and moral hazard. When traditional differentiators of firm quality are lacking, such as in emerging economic sectors, markets may turn to secondary information sources to filter and sort firms. We investigate the roles played by observable corporate governance characteristics as indirect indicators of new firms' potential qualitative differences. Markets may sort firms based on such characteristics because they are perceived to be correlated with desired but unobservable characteristics and actions and the lower the risks of both adverse selection and moral hazard. Our study of publicly traded U. S. Internet firms found that firm market valuation was strongly associated with corporate governance characteristics (e.g., executive and director stock-based incentives, institutional and blockholder stock ownership, board structure, and venture capital participation). In addition, firm age moderated how markets used some quality proxies to determine firm valuation during the post-IPO period.

"Migrants are a growing segment of the highly educated international workforce, and these skilled migrants (SMs) are critical to the growth of developed, mature economies. SMs frequently report negative workplace experiences antithetical to their integration, raising important questions about how organizations might help these host-country newcomers to transition to become organizational insiders. Our aim is to integrate a broad and multidisciplinary literature and identify opportunities where organizations and managers might intervene to enable a successful socialization process and improve SMs' workplace experiences. We review the empirical research from 2000 to 2019 for SMs employed in developed, mature economies and focus on the SMs' workplace experiences postorganizational entry. We employ a three-phase socialization model (anticipatory socialization, accommodation, and adaptation) as our organizing framework to identify SMs' key challenges and outcomes, consider those challenges and outcomes through a socialization lens, and isolate the challenges and outcomes that characterize each transition point (from anticipatory socialization to accommodation and from accommodation to adaptation). We then use these distinguishing characteristics to recommend activities that organizations can implement at each transition to facilitate SMs' socialization process. By leveraging the three-phase socialization model to align organizational activities with SMs' workplace experiences, we extend the field's understanding of SM socialization (in particular) and of the organizational socialization process (more generally).","['skilled migrants', 'organizational socialization', 'global mobilityCHINESE PROFESSIONAL IMMIGRANTS', 'JOB-SATISFACTION', 'LIVED EXPERIENCES', 'ACCULTURATION STRATEGIES', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT', 'POLISH NURSES', 'FUTURE', 'WORK', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MIGRATION']","['skilled migrants', 'skilled migrants', 'organizational socialization', 'organizational socialization', 'work']",migrants mature economies workplace experiences socialization organizational socialization process
"At the heart of any innovation process lies a fundamental practice: the way people create ideas and solve problems. This decision making side of innovation is what scholars and practitioners refer to as design. Decisions in innovation processes have so far been taken by humans. What happens when they can be substituted by machines? Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings data and algorithms to the core of the innovation processes. What are the implications of this diffusion of AI for our understanding of design and innovation? Is AI just another digital technology that, akin to many others, will not significantly question what we know about design? Or will it create transformations in design that current theoretical frameworks cannot capture? This paper proposes a framework for understanding the design and innovation in the age of AI. We discuss the implications for design and innovation theory. Specifically, we observe that, as creative problem-solving is significantly conducted by algorithms, human design increasingly becomes an activity of sensemaking, that is, understanding which problems should or could be addressed. This shift in focus calls for the new theories and brings design closer to leadership, which is, inherently, an activity of sensemaking. Our insights are derived from and illustrated with two cases at the frontier of AI-Netflix and Airbnb (complemented with analyses of Microsoft and Tesla)-which point to two directions for the evolution of design and innovation in firms. First, AI enables an organization to overcome many past limitations of human-intensive design processes, by improving the scalability of the process, broadening its scope across traditional boundaries, and enhancing its ability to learn and adapt on the fly. Second, and maybe more surprising, while removing these limitations, AI also appears to deeply enact several popular design principles. AI thus reinforces the principles of Design Thinking, namely: being people-centered, abductive, and iterative. In fact, AI enables the creation of solutions that are more highly user centered than human-based approaches (i.e., to an extreme level of granularity, designed for every single person); that are potentially more creative; and that are continuously updated through learning iterations across the entire product life cycle. In sum, while AI does not undermine the basic principles of design, it profoundly changes the practice of design. Problem-solving tasks, traditionally carried out by designers, are now automated into learning loops that operate without limitations of volume and speed. The algorithms embedded in these loops think in a radically different way than a designer who handles the complex problems holistically with a systemic perspective. Algorithms instead handle complexity through very simple tasks, which are iterated continuously. This paper discusses the implications of these insights for design and innovation management scholars and practitioners.","['nanRADICAL INNOVATION', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'CREATIVITY', 'MOTIVATION', 'FRAMEWORK']","['technology', 'framework']",algorithms sensemaking
"Purpose - The paper seeks to provide academic researchers and practitioners with a better understanding about purchasing strategies through an integrated approach to supplier selection and purchasing decisions. Design/methodology/approach - This paper views supplier selection as a multi-criteria problem. Through the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), in consideration of both quantitative and qualitative criteria, a set of candidate suppliers is identified. A multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) model, with multiple objectives and a set of system constraints, is then formulated and solved to allocate the optimum order quantities to the candidate suppliers. Findings - The paper provides tradeoffs among different objectives, which are more consistent with the complexity and nature of the real-world decision-making environment. It also offers better information and solutions supporting effective purchasing decisions. Research limitations/implications - The main concept of the proposed approach can be applicable to any organization with a purchasing function. However, its implementation will be very specific to a particular organization of interest, as each individual organization must define its own subjective criteria and constraints. The area of decision support system development, which automates (or computerizes) the input process of the proposed models and integrates with other databases in a company, will provide great opportunities for future research. Practical implications - The paper provides practitioners with flexibility and effectiveness in their supplier selection and purchasing decision process and with a better understanding about their future purchasing strategies. The results from the application of the proposed models to the supplier selection problem at a high-technology firm in Taiwan show that the models are effective and applicable. Originality/value - This paper takes an integrated approach to problem analysis (i.e. multi-objectives with both quantitative and qualitative information), uses a sound scientific methodology in model development (i.e. integrating AHP with MOLP), and provides practical use of the models. it offers additional knowledge and value to both academics and practitioners.","['supplier evaluation', 'order systems', 'analytical hierarchy process', 'linear programmingANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS', 'MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM', 'MULTIPLE CRITERIA', 'VENDOR SELECTION', 'MODEL', 'DESIGN', 'COST']","['analytical hierarchy process', 'analytical hierarchy process', 'analytical hierarchy process', 'model', 'design']",purchasing supplier selection analytical hierarchy process
"Research SummaryManagers at multiple levels of a firm influence resource allocation but most research focuses on senior rather than middle managers. We study involvement of middle managers in decision making, focusing on how rewards and controls shape resource allocation. We argue that higher income growth uncertainty (rewards) and lower monitoring (controls) increase resource allocation most strongly when middle managers are more involved in decisions. We test the arguments for ATM and bank branch allocations in Indian banks from 2011 to 2014. We assess causal mechanisms by comparing more and less favorable conditions for allocation, as well as considering a poststudy exogenous shock. The results suggest that the rewards and controls have different associations with resource allocation depending on the involvement of senior and middle managers. Managerial SummaryThe study examines how rewards and controls shape resource allocation decisions by middle managers, focusing on rewards arising from uncertainty about employee income and controls based on monitoring. The work suggests that rewards and controls that influence resource allocation by one level of managers may have less effect for another level. Hence, a firm's plans for resource deployment need to include rewards and controls that are relevant for both senior and middle managers.","['agency problems', 'incentives', 'middle managers', 'resource allocation', 'senior managersSTRATEGIC BUSINESS EXIT', 'GOVERNMENT-OWNED BANKS', 'MANAGERIAL COMPENSATION', 'ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION', 'INTERACTION TERMS', 'INCENTIVES', 'REDEPLOYMENT', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'EXPANSION']","['middle managers', 'middle managers', 'resource allocation', 'resource allocation', 'uncertainty']",resource allocation uncertainty deployment
"The wide variation in the success of innovations obscures similarities in the process of firms being influenced by other firms when choosing production technology. We argue that diffusion processes are similar across successful and failed innovations. Production asset innovation success results not only from innovation quality differencesearly chance events and subsequent path dependence are also intrinsic to diffusion processes. Thus, diffusion processes do not reliably spread the best innovations, producing competitive advantage for firms with an early lead producing innovations and firms adopting high-quality innovations. We test these predictions quantitatively by analyzing the diffusion of the DC-10 and L-1011 airplanes, and find support for our theory linking the social information provided by firm adoptions to the success of innovative production technologies.

"Because hedonic products consist predominantly of experience attributes, often with many available alternatives, choosing the right one is a demanding task for consumers. Decision making becomes even more difficult when a group, instead of an individual consumer, will consume the product, as is regularly the case for hedonic offerings such as movies, opera performances, and wine. Noting the prevalence of automated recommender systems as decision aids, the authors investigate the power of group recommender systems that consider the preferences of all group members. The authors develop a conceptual framework of the effects of group recommenders and empirically examine these effects through two choice experiments. They find that automated group recommenders offer more valuable information than single recommenders when the choice agent must consume the recommended alternative.

"Adopting a multifoci approach to psychological contract breach (i.e., breach by the organization referent and breach by the supervisor referent), the authors propose a trickle-down model of breach. Results from three studies show that supervisor perceptions of organizational breach are negatively related to supervisor citizenship behaviors toward the subordinate, resulting in subordinate perceptions of supervisory breach. Subordinate breach perceptions are, in turn, negatively related to subordinate citizenship behaviors toward the customer and, ultimately, customer satisfaction. The findings demonstrate the interconnected nature of social exchange relationships at work and draw attention to the effects of breach for other employees and customers.","['psychological contract breach', 'customer service', 'social exchange theoryORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'PERCEIVED SUPERVISOR SUPPORT', 'SOCIAL-EXCHANGE', 'EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP', 'EMPLOYEES', 'JUSTICE', 'SATISFACTION', 'MODEL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'IMPACT']","['psychological contract breach', 'psychological contract breach', 'psychological contract breach', 'social exchange', 'social exchange', 'employees', 'satisfaction', 'model']",psychological contract breach trickle down organizational breach citizenship behaviors satisfaction
"Relationship marketing has taken on a significant role in both retail practice and academic study. However, from the introduction of the concept of relationship marketing into the literature scholars have noted that relationship building may not be beneficial to all firms under all conditions. In this study, we investigate this issue attempting to gain a greater understanding of the value of relationship marketing activities across targets (i.e., customers and suppliers) and within contexts (i.e., competitive intensity and three elements of market dynamism) on a retailer's ability to develop the capability of market responsiveness. Our findings, based upon a sample of 172 small retailers, demonstrate that differences do in fact exist in the value delivery to retailers from relationships with different targets and across different contexts in which the retailer operates. As such, the results of this study extend the extant relationship marketing literature, refining our understanding of the value of relationship marketing. Implications for academics and practitioners are discussed. (C) 2009 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Strategic human capital research has emphasized the importance of human capital as a resource for sustained competitive advantage, but firm investments in this intangible asset vary considerably. This article examines whether and how external pressures on firms from capital markets influence their human capital strategy. These pressures have increased over the past three decades due to banking deregulation, technological innovation, and the rise of institutional investors and new financial intermediaries. Against this backdrop, this study examines whether a firm's capital structure as measured by share turnover, shareholder concentration, and financial leverage is associated with firm investment in strategic human capital. Based on survey and objective financial data from 221 establishments in the United States and Canada, our analysis indicates that firms with greater share turnover, higher shareholder concentration, and higher levels of financial leverage are less likely to invest in human resource systems that create strategic human capital. Differences in national financial systems also lead to differential effects for U.S. and Canadian firms.","['capital structure', 'financial markets', 'ownership', 'human capital', 'high involvement work systemsPERFORMANCE WORK PRACTICES', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES', 'VOLUNTARY TURNOVER', 'CUSTOMER SERVICE', 'HUMAN-RESOURCES', 'CALL CENTERS']","['capital structure', 'capital structure', 'human capital', 'human capital', 'competitive advantage', 'competitive advantage']",human capital competitive capital structure
"Although researchers have expended considerable effort exploring the links between new product strategy and firm-level performance, most studies of this subject focus on small- to medium-sized firms. Compared to smaller firms, however, large companies typically maintain broader portfolios of products and have easier access to capital markets. Such fundamental differences suggest the need for closer examination of the relationship between new product strategy and the performance of large firms. Based on a study of 459 new products introduced during a 5-year period, Richard W. Firth and V. K. Narayanan profile the new product strategies of 18 large companies. They examine the methods used to acquire new products (internal development or external sources) as well as three dimensions of each firm's new product introductions: newness of embodied technology, newness of market application, and innovativeness in the market. In other words, these profiles identify the degree to which a firm's new product introductions involve core technologies and markets that are new to the firm, as well as the degree to which the market views these products as innovative. Because new product strategy is an investment decision, the study also examines the relationship between these strategic profiles and two facets of firm-level performance: risk and return. The study identifies five archetypes of new product strategy: Innovators, who produce innovative products by using their existing resources; Investors in Technology, who focus on expanding their technological base. Searching for New Markets, firms that venture into unfamiliar markets by introducing products closely aligned with those in their existing portfolios; Business as Usual, firms that rely, on existing technologies and products to serve existing markets; and Middle-of-the-Road, firms content to introduce new products rated as low to moderate along all three dimensions of the strategic profile. For new products closely aligned with their core markets and technologies, the firms in this study typically rely on infernal development. To introduce products involving new technologies or market applications, they turn to acquisition from external sources. Firms that emphasized market innovativeness in their new product introductions enjoyed higher returns than less innovative firms. And contrary to conventional wisdom, they gained this advantage without an accompanying increase in risk. In other words, continual innovation might provide a large firm with the means for achieving higher returns without higher risk.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'INDUSTRIAL', 'RISK', 'MANAGEMENT', 'SUCCESS', 'IMPACT']","['performance', 'technology', 'risk']",performance investment risk
"This paper considers contemporary business practice and its sustainable performance from the view of stakeholders and their perceived value. A company has responsibilities and commitments to many different internal and external stakeholders in the marketplace and society. This view underlines the need for organizations to, not only provide value, but do so in a sustainable and socially responsible manner. A model is developed based on five, separate but interconnected, elements. The model is iterative and acknowledges its elementary state, suggesting further development and refinement in the field of sustainable business practices from an ethical perspective.

"Today, many organizations are adopting streamlined, adaptive hierarchies that increasingly employ teams in daily operations. This paper focuses on the use of teams in international R&D networks. Specifically, it investigates the incidence of R&D teams and analyses the influence of four contingency factors on team utilization. The four contingency factors are cultural distance, geographic distance, the research mandate and the market mandate of the local R&D unit. Based on a survey conducted in 2000, we present empirical evidence on 49 leading German MNCs, accounting for 66% of the nations' privately funded R&D in 1999. Our results clearly demonstrate that firms increasingly use international teams as a means of coordinating such projects. The type of work conducted by an international R&D unit has a strong bearing on the utilization of teams. The latter is linked to a mandate of an R&D unit as capability exploiting rather than capability augmenting. Also, R&D units with a global mandate are more likely to use international teams as a coordination mechanism. On,the other hand, we do not find support for geographical or cultural distance as determining factors for the use of international RD teams. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

"Consumer researchers have primarily conceptualized cultural capital either as an endowed stock of resources that tend to reproduce socioeconomic hierarchies among consumer collectivities or as constellations of knowledge and skill that consumers acquire by making identity investments in a given consumption field. These studies, however, have given scant attention to the theoretical distinction between dominant and subordinate forms of cultural capital, with the latter affording comparatively lower conversion rates for economic, social, and symbolic capital. To redress this oversight, this article presents a multimethod investigation of middle-class men who are performing the emergent gender role of at-home fatherhood. Our analysis profiles and theoretically elaborates upon a set of capitalizing consumption practices through which at-home fathers seek to enhance the conversion rates of their acquisitions of domesticated (and subordinate) cultural capital and to build greater cultural legitimacy for their marginalized gender identity.","['nanHOUSEHOLD LABOR', 'HEGEMONIC MASCULINITY', 'GENDERED DIVISION', 'CONSUMERS', 'IDENTITY', 'WOMEN', 'EXPERIENCE', 'ATTITUDES', 'MEANINGS', 'FAMILY']","['consumers', 'identity']",knowledge conversion

However, various weaknesses in this work have involved problems with sequential timing, nonindependence of measurements, and contamination by market(ing)-related influences.

"Many retailers invest in ancillary services to provide shoppers with additional reasons to come to their stores. However, it is unclear whether these services insulate incumbents from new entrants. We address this question by examining how the size and uniqueness of an incumbent's service portfolio protects its sales after a new competitor enters. We study uniqueness by introducing the notion of competitive service overlap (CSO) that operationalizes service similarity, and show both that retailers are best served by offering many services and that particularly successful retailers have more unique service portfolios. Furthermore, the impact of uniqueness is most prominent when a grocery incumbent faces a discounter entrant (e.g., Kroger facing a Wal-Mart entry). (C) 2016 New York University.

"We propose a social perspective emphasizing the opportunities and constraints of bank-firm relationships to understand the determinants of relationship banks' performance, using Japanese banks to test our theory. Using social exchange and role theories, we found banks that have strong social relationships performed differently during Japan's macroeconomic expansion and contraction cycles. However, our results indicate that social exchange and role relationships are context-specific: banks benefited from internationalization during a domestic macroeconomic expansion as a result of their home-country social relationships, but they were less constrained by the same social relationships in their international operations during a domestic macroeconomic contraction.","['relationship banking', 'comparative corporate governance', 'social exchange and role', 'business groups', 'Japan', 'keiretsuFOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'UNITED-STATES', 'LONGITUDINAL DATA', 'FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'EXCHANGE', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'INFORMATION', 'TRUST', 'POWER']","['social exchange and role', 'social exchange and role', 'social exchange and role', 'social exchange and role', 'japan', 'exchange']",performance
"In light of the perceived benefits derived from inward FDI, many developed economies have systematically established investment promotion agencies (IPAs) to attract foreign investment. While IPAs in the past have been created by a wide variety of countries and regions, their target economies have overwhelmingly been in developed markets. The rise of emerging market MNEs is significantly changing this picture. We analyse the impact of IPAs on attracting emerging market FDI to developed economies by looking at the example of Chinese FDI into Canada. We find strong statistical evidence that the presence of Canadian provincial-level IPAs located in China increases the likelihood of Chinese firms locating in that Canadian province. Focusing on the role of IPAs in lowering liabilities of foreignness, we explore how differences in host and home country contexts may explain our findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"This paper addresses effects of picture-text congruence in the online environment on consumer response. Based on recent theorizing on processing fluency, it is argued that congruence among symbolic meanings connoted by pictorial and textual elements of web design increases processing fluency, in turn enhancing attitude fort-nation. Since symbolic meaning integration requires elaborate processing, the influence of individual differences reflecting consumers' information processing is discussed and predictions are formulated. An experimental study was conducted requiring participants to evaluate an online hotel booking site in which symbolic meanings connoted by hotel appearance and hotel description either matched or mismatched. Results show that picture-text congruence positively affects product attitude via processing fluency but only so for participants high in need for cognition. These findings indicate that picture-text congruence in web design may impact consumer response, thereby highlighting the importance of careful consideration of the online environment.

"Use of job-provided or personally owned smartphones at work and at home, henceforth office-home smartphone (OHS), has created a new open door policy, portending many changes for employees and organizations. We examine the unique attributes of OHS use, such as flexibility, productivity, and work overload, along with the impact of these attributes on work-to-life conflict and other work-related outcomes. The findings of this study show that an increased work overload due to OHS use results in greater work-to-life conflict, which creates job stress and user resistance to OHS; however, productivity gained due to OHS use can reduce work overload. Our findings indicate that business organizations can minimize negative effects of OHS by promoting an organizational culture that supports segmentation of work and attempts to minimize work-to-life conflict and its consequences. Results also provide guidance to scholars seeking a comprehensive research model on the use of smartphones traversing work and home.","['Bring your own device (BYOD)', 'mobile business', 'office-home smartphone (OHS)', 'segmentation culture', 'stress', 'user resistance', 'work-to-life conflictFAMILY CONFLICT', 'VIRTUAL OFFICE', 'HOME', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'BALANCE', 'TECHNOSTRESS', 'INITIATIVES', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'MODERATORS', 'WORKPLACE']","['office home smartphone ohs ', 'office home smartphone ohs ', 'office home smartphone ohs ', 'office home smartphone ohs ', 'stress', 'user resistance', 'user resistance', 'home']",smartphones productivity overload conflict resistance
"Multidisciplinary evidence suggests that people often make evaluative judgments by monitoring their feelings toward the target. This article examines, in the context of moderately complex and consciously accessible stimuli, the judgmental properties of consciously monitored feelings. Results from four studies show that, compared to cold, reason-based assessments of the target, the conscious monitoring of feelings provides judgmental responses that are (a) potentially faster, (b) more stable and consistent across individuals, and importantly (c) more predictive of the number and valence of people's thoughts. These findings help explain why the monitoring of feelings is an often diagnostic pathway to evaluation in judgment and decision making.","['nanSOCIAL-PERCEPTION', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'MOOD', 'MEMORY', 'ATTITUDES', 'COGNITION', 'EXPOSURE', 'THINKING', 'EMOTION', 'CHOICE']","['decision making', 'decision making']",judgments
"Research summary: This article uses Group-Based Trajectory (GBT) Models to advance strategic management research, focusing on demonstrating the differential impacts of markets for technology on the value of technological capabilities. Group Based Trajectory (GBT) models, a statistical technique based on finite mixture models, can be used to discern heterogeneity based on an attribute of interest, especially when the heterogeneity changes or evolves over time, and when there is a lack of theoretical guidance to discern the basis of heterogeneity. We illustrate these advantages of GBT models in our study of how the moderating effect of markets for technology on the value of technological capability is itself moderated by firm types.

"Retail pricing decisions are often made with respect to the price sensitivity of shoppers in a retail store or market area. This paper explores how certain brand and consumer characteristics relate to the variability of brand price elasticities across stores belonging to the same chain. The authors measure the price sensitivity of 14 liquor brands sold in 35 store locations. Since the stores operate in a monopoly environment, the analysis is free from the confounds caused by competitive pricing or promotional activity that often hamper retail pricing studies. Also, the monopoly situation provides data that represent a census of brand sales in the categories studied Results of a two-stage econometric analysis show that brand price elasticity is higher for brands that are promoted more frequently and for brands that have higher market shares. The magnitude of brand price elasticity is also found to be directly related to the household income in a market area and inversely related to the proportion of residents in a market area who are African-American.","['nanCHOICE', 'SUBSTITUTION', 'COMPETITION', 'PROMOTIONS', 'PRODUCTS', 'DEMAND', 'IMPACT', 'SALES']",['sales'],pricing price american
"Research Summary Software platforms create value by cultivating an ecosystem of complementary products and services. Existing explanations for how a prospective complementor chooses platforms to join assume the complementor has rich information about the range of available platforms. However, complementors lack this information in many ecosystems, raising the question of how complementors learn about platforms in the first place. We investigate whether attending a temporary gathering-a hackathon-impacts the platform choices of software developers. Through a large-scale quantitative study of 1,302 developers and 167 hackathons, supported by qualitative research, we analyze the multiple channels-sponsorship, social learning, knowledge exchange, and social coordination-through which hackathons serve as a social forum for the diffusion of platform adoption among attendees. Managerial Summary A software platform such as Windows, iOS, or Amazon Web Services relies on third-party developers to create applications that complement the platform and make it valuable for end users. However, developers face a wide range of possible platforms, and they may have limited information about which platforms would be worthwhile to develop for. A software platform business can educate and encourage developers to adopt their platform by supporting in-person software development competitions, known as hackathons. Developers learn about prospective platforms that advertise at the hackathon. Developers also learn whether and how to use a platform by observing and teaching one other. Hackathons are particularly useful for spreading platform technologies: developers prefer to adopt widely used platforms, and hackathons permit developers to identify and join fashionable platforms.","['complex contagions', 'hackathons', 'innovation ecosystems', 'multisided platforms', 'technology diffusionFOCUSED ORGANIZATION', 'STRUCTURAL BALANCE', 'TRADE-OFFS', 'INNOVATION', 'COMPETITION', 'NETWORKS', 'SOFTWARE', 'ENTRY', 'COMMUNITIES', 'DEVELOPERS']","['hackathons', 'competition', 'software', 'developers']",platforms complementary products hackathon

This hypothesis is tested by surveying the perceptions of cultural differences of top management teams of recently acquired firms, and then relating these perceptions to related stock market gains to the buying firms. The findings suggest a strong inverse relationship between perceptions of cultural differences and shareholder gains, after controlling for perceptions of the buying firm's tolerance for multiculturalism and the relative size of the merging firms.","['MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE', 'SHAREHOLDER VALUEORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ACQUISITIONS', 'STRATEGY', 'MARKET', 'FIRM']","['market', 'firm']",management cultures
"Relationship maintenance (customer retention and exclusivity) and development (increased service usage and cross-buying) are top priorities in Customer Relationship Management. This paper examines how service companies can effectively influence customer patronage behaviors by leveraging overall customer satisfaction, trust and relationship commitment. Using a longitudinal design over a two-year period, we merge survey metrics with actual patronage behaviors taken from a bank's database. We show that relationship commitment just enhances retention and exclusivity while trust directly influences service usage and cross-buying. As a consequence, trust appears to be highly critical for service relationship development and company profits. Furthermore, trust and relationship commitment mediate the entire impact of satisfaction which appears as a necessary but not sufficient condition for relationship maintenance and development. Satisfaction, and more generally service evaluations, must be efficiently converted into trust and relationship commitment before providing business results. Finally, we establish the temporal antecedence and the predictive power of trust and relationship commitment. Relationship commitment in year t predicts the number of service providers in year t + 1 (exclusivity vs. polygamy), while trust in year t predicts the number of bank products (cross-buying) as well as the service usage level in year t + 1. We then discuss managerial implications for customer relationship maintenance and development.","['Customer relationship management', 'Loyalty', 'Customer retention', 'Service usage', 'Cross-buying', 'Overall satisfaction', 'Trust', 'Relationship commitment', 'Service marketing', 'BankCUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS', 'LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS', 'SWITCHING COSTS', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'DYNAMIC-MODEL', 'LOYALTY', 'QUALITY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'SHARE']","['customer relationship management', 'customer relationship management', 'customer relationship management', 'customer retention', 'customer retention', 'service usage', 'service usage', 'cross buying', 'cross buying', 'trust', 'relationship commitment', 'relationship commitment', 'management']",behaviors satisfaction relationship commitment
"This paper begins to reconcile competing perspectives on the origins of competitive advantage by examining the adoption of 'science-driven' drug discovery, a performance-enhancing organizational practice. Science-driven drug discovery diffused slowly, allowing us to disentangle alternative theories of organizational heterogeneity. Adoption is driven by initial conditions, time-varying internal and external environmental conditions, and convergence (firms positioned least favorably adopt most aggressively). While accounting for initial conditions is critical, managers are sensitive to idiosyncratic environmental cues. The origins of competitive advantage may therefore lie in the ability to identify and respond to environmental cues well in advance of observing performance-oriented pay-offs.

"On-line shopping is expected to experience exponential growth in the coming decades, but few researchers have examined consumers' motivations for using on-line channels. The current study investigates the determinants of consumer use of on-line channels to purchase financial products. There are three key findings. First, consumers who experience conflict with their Financial agents are more likely to use the on-line channel. This suggests that conflicting relationships can make the two channels competitive rather than complementary. Second, consumer willingness is an important predictor of on-line information search. Third, consumers who use the on-line channel for information search are more likely to use it for transactions. The last two findings indicate that consumer adoption of the on-line channel is a stagewise process.","['consumer ability', 'consumer behavior', 'consumer motivation', 'electronic markets', 'financial services industryELECTRONIC MARKETS', 'MARKETPLACES', 'INFORMATION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'MODEL', 'SERVICES']",['information'],on line shopping on line channels information search
"This article reports the development and validation of a theory-based, short form measure of cultural intelligence (SFCQ). The SFCQ captures the original theoretical intent of a multifaceted culture general form of intelligence that is related to effective intercultural interactions. The validity of the scale is established with 3526 participants in five language groups from around the world. Results provide evidence for construct and criterion-related validity of the measure, and indicate that cultural intelligence is a single latent factor reflected in three intermediate facets. In support of construct validity the measure is modestly related to but distinct from emotional intelligence and personality and correlates positively with several indicators of multicultural experience. With regard to criterion-related validity, it relates as predicted to several dimensions of intercultural effectiveness. Implications for the measurement and understanding of culture and the influence of culture on management practice are discussed.","['cross-cultural management', 'culture', 'construct development and evaluation', 'cross-cultural research/measurement issuesC-OAR-SE', 'FIT INDEXES', 'CONSTRUCT-VALIDITY', 'SCALE DEVELOPMENT', 'VALUES', 'MODEL', 'BICULTURALISM', 'ACCULTURATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETENCE']","['culture', 'construct validity', 'construct validity']",cultural intelligence criterion construct validity emotional intelligence personality
"Two distinct causal mehanisms-resource-picking and capability-building-have been proposed in the strategic management literature about how firms create economic rents. Under the resource-picking mechanism, managers gather information and analysis to outsmart the resource market in picking resources, similar to the way that a mutual fund manager tries to outsmart the Stock market in picking stocks. Under the capability-building mechanism, managers design and construct organizational systems to enhance the productivity of whatever resources the jinn acquires. These two rent-creation mechanisms are certainly not mutually exclusive, and it is likely that firms generally use both of them. It is therefore important to consider the interaction between these two rent-creation mechanisms: Do they complement each other? Or are they substitutes for each other? in Other words, do they enhance each other's value, or detract from each other's value? Answering these questions is a necessary precondition to understanding how firms should allocate their time and effort between these two rent-creation mechanisms. The present paper develops a basic theoretical model to address these questions, and derives testable hypothesis from the model. The model predicts that the two rent-creation mechanisms are complementary in some circumstances but substitutes in others.

Two survey studies investigate recreational shopper identity in a clothing shopping context.

Recreational shopping enthusiasts are found to engage more extensively in a range of retail shopping behaviors, to spend more money shopping (i.e., they are not just browsers), and are more multi-channel than other shoppers, reporting higher levels of Internet, catalog, and TV home shopping as well as traditional brick-and-mortar shopping.","['shopping', 'recreation', 'leisure', 'self-concept', 'identitySCALE DEVELOPMENT', 'LEISURE']","['shopping', 'recreation', 'leisure', 'self concept', 'self concept', 'leisure']",self scale experienced behaviors
"This article explores the meanings that consumption experiences hold for professional working mothers engaged in the culturally prominent lifestyle known as ''juggling.'' A discussion is given to prior research documenting the cultural and historical processes that gave rise to this lifestyle pattern. These analyses suggest that ''jugglers'' of the baby boom generation have been socialized in a common system of conflicting cultural ideals, beliefs, and gender ideologies. A hermeneutic research approach is used to explicate the emic consumer meanings that arise in relation to the participants' salient life concerns and their sense of personal history. An etic framework is then derived that further analyzes these perceptions in the context of issues related to the social construction of feminine identities and cultural conceptions of motherhood. The conceptual and methodological implications of the emic and etic frameworks for consumer research are discussed.","['nanWOMEN', 'EXPERIENCES', 'ROLES']",['experiences'],working
"This study integrates Kaplan and Kaplan's framework on informational variables (mystery, complexity, legibility, and coherence) with construal level theory to examine how managers can use the visual design of virtual servicescapes to achieve a sense of telepresence (the subjective experience of being in a computer-mediated environment, even when one is physically elsewhere). Three studies using mixed methods and diverse samples show that informational variables vary in their capacity to evoke telepresence and thus in their impact on consumer behavioral intention. Study 1, a content analysis, uses expert judges and a global pool of virtual servicescapes to provide initial evidence that informational variables impact telepresence. Study 2, a commercial survey, shows that telepresence mediates effects of mystery and complexity (sensorially richer variables) on consumer intentions to approach. Study 3 uses a consumer sample to replicate the mediating role of telepresence and to show that a person's visual processing style moderates effects of mystery and complexity. The effects are robust in the presence of an alternative process path through aesthetics and occur regardless of consumers' familiarity with the servicescape, category knowledge, and involvement. Managerial implications focus on how to increase mystery and complexity for higher telepresence.","['aesthetics', 'approach-avoidance', 'telepresence', 'virtual tour', 'wineCONSTRUAL-LEVEL THEORY', 'CONSUMER RESPONSES', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'VERBAL INFORMATION', 'VISUAL COMPLEXITY', 'WEB SITE', 'ONLINE', 'INTERACTIVITY', 'EXPERIENCE', 'MODEL']","['aesthetics', 'telepresence', 'experience']",complexity construal level virtual servicescapes category
"To move beyond the current emphasis on voice level or quantity in voice research, it is important to consider the effects of making suggestions that others view as poor quality. Guided by sociometer theory, we propose that voice quality affects workplace ostracism: The coworker may see the employee who makes bad suggestions as incompetent, which results in the employee being ostracized. The employee's ostracism experience matters because it may not only result in the employee's self-perception of poor voice quality but may also lead the employee to rate the coworker's suggestions more harshly. In a field study over 6 weeks (294 employee-coworker dyads) and two vignette experiments (401 subjects), we found support for this sociometer view of voice quality. Thus, this study makes an important contribution to voice research by highlighting the quality dimension of voice. Employees who hope to effect change through their voice should monitor whether the quality of their suggestions will be judged favorably or unfavorably by their coworkers to avoid being ostracized.","['voice', 'ostracism', 'sociometer theoryORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'SOCIAL EXCLUSION', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'EMPLOYEE VOICE', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'SELF-ESTEEM', 'INTERPERSONAL MONITOR', 'WORKPLACE OSTRACISM', 'ABUSIVE SUPERVISION', 'HALO ERROR']","['voice', 'ostracism', 'workplace ostracism', 'workplace ostracism']",sociometer ostracism
"Economic models suggest that firms use a simple cost-benefit calculation to evaluate customer requests for new product features, but an extensive organizational literature shows the decision to implement innovation is more nuanced. We address this theoretical tension by studying how firms respond to customer requests for incremental product innovations, and how these responses change when the requested innovation is complex. Using large sample empirical analyses combined with detailed qualitative data drawn from interviews, we find considerable variance in the relationship between customer demands, complexity, and investments in incremental innovations. The qualitative study revealed the importance of organization structures, competitive pressures, and incentives for resource allocation processes.

"According to transaction cost economics (TCE) reasoning, firms choose equity (as opposed to non-equity) foreign market entry modes to safeguard specific assets. The present paper contextualizes the well-researched relationship between asset specificity and foreign market entry mode choice by introducing knowledge safeguards (international experience, host-country networks, and imitation) and institutional safeguards (property rights protection and cultural proximity) as alternative mechanisms for securing a firm's specific assets. Testing our hypotheses on a sample of 206 small and medium-sized enterprises, we find that knowledge safeguards and institutional safeguards weaken the effect of asset specificity on the choice of equity foreign market entry modes. Contextualizing the relationship between asset specificity and foreign market entry mode choice helps to enhance our understanding of the scope conditions of TCE-based entry mode studies and beyond.

"Researchers from diverse disciplines have examined the many factors that contribute to the influence of published research papers. Such influence dynamics are in essence a marketing of science issue. In this paper, we propose that in addition to known established, overt drivers of influence such as journal, article, author, and Matthew effects, a latent factor citability influences the eventual impact of a paper. Citability is a mid-range latent variable that captures the changing relationship of an article to a field. Our analysis using a discretized Tobit model with hidden Markov processes suggests that there are two states of citability, and these dynamic states determine eventual influence of a paper. Prior research in marketing has relied on models where the various effects such as author and journal effects are deemed static. Unlike ours, these models fail to capture the continuously evolving impact dynamics of a paper and the differential effect of the various drivers that depend on the latent state a paper is in at any given point of time. Our model also captures the impact of uncitedness, which other models fail to do. Our model is estimated using articles published in seven leading marketing journals during the years 1996-2003. Findings and implications are discussed.","['Citation', 'Citability', 'Matthew effect', 'Uncitedness', 'Scientometrics', 'Hidden Markov model', 'TobitQUALITY RANKING', 'IMPACT', 'ONLINE', 'CITATIONS', 'CUSTOMER', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'JOURNALS', 'MODELS', 'BRANDS', 'SIZE']","['citability', 'matthew effect', 'matthew effect', 'uncitedness', 'impact', 'journals', 'models']",dynamics tobit model hidden
"The paper reports a study of the post-acquisition integration process in three foreign acquisitions made by Swedish multinationals. Detailed interview data and questionnaire responses in both acquiring and acquired firms are presented. The sub-processes of task integration. and human integration are separated out and it is shown that effective integration in these cases was achieved through a two-phase process. In phase one, task integration led to a satisficing solution that limited the interaction between acquired and acquiring units, while human integration proceeded smoothly and led to cultural convergence and mutual respect. In phase two, there was renewed task integration built on the success of the human integration that had been achieved, which led to much greater interdependencies between acquired and acquiring units.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MERGERS', 'FIRMS', 'TAKEOVERS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'SYNERGY']",['firms'],firms
"Some 25 years ago while developing his type of entrepreneur and type of firm classification system, Smith (1967) thought he had identified a subtype of entrepreneur that did not fit either his craftsman or his opportunistic models. The data at that time were too sparse to be sure, but it appeared that there were certain entrepreneurs whose major concern was to develop an organization, not as an end in itself as with the opportunistic type, but rather as a vehicle to allow the invention and production of various products. This research now provides much more convincing evidence that the inventor-entrepreneur does indeed exist, using a sample of 147 National Science Foundation grant applicants who are also entrepreneurs. This sample was deemed particularly likely to contain large numbers of inventor-entrepreneurs. The support for Smith's (1967) early speculations turns out to be rather amazing. The inventor-entrepreneurs are located exactly where Smith (1967) expected them to be in the type of entrepreneur versus type of firm matrix. As anticipated, inventor-entrepreneurs, like other entrepreneurs, are more likely to head growing companies to the extent that they themselves are of the opportunistic type and their firms are of the adaptive type; there is nothing in the inventor-entrepreneur concept alone that calls for company growth. Also as hypothesized, the presence of a large number of inventor-entrepreneurs in a sample tends to dilute the usual finding of a strong positive correlation between type of entrepreneur and type of firm measures; among inventor-entrepreneurs it is not necessarily true that opportunistic entrepreneurs tend to head adaptive firms and craftsman entrepreneurs head rigid ones. There was one unexpected finding, however, Smith (1967) originally associated the inventor-entrepreneur with a proclivity for taking out patents. Although this association is supported by this research, it is dwarfed by another factor. What is really indicative of inventor-entrepreneurship is a strong commitment to a company strategy of new product development. Although not established by this research, it would appear that increasingly those who invent are dissuaded from seeking patents by the costs involved, the time delays, and the prospect in many new industries that patents will provide very little protection. It seems likely that patents will continue to decline in popularity among inventor-entrepreneurs, and that rapid market entry with new products to become a market leader will be the preferred strategy of the future. This assumes of course that inventor-entrepreneurs have access to sufficient capital to pursue this new product development strategy effectively. Investors should recognize, however, that the real importance of the inventor-entrepreneur stems not so much from immediate profit potential and the prospects for asset growth, although these are there, as from the contributions these individuals make to an expanding economy and the well-being of society.","['nanMOTIVATION', 'GROWTH', 'FIRMS']","['growth', 'firms']",
"Scholarly impact is one of the strongest currencies in the Academy and has traditionally been equated with number of citations-be it for individuals, articles, departments, universities, journals, or entire fields. Adopting an alternative definition and measure, we use number of pages as indexed by Google to assess scholarly impact on stakeholders outside the Academy. Based on a sample including 384 of the 550 most highly cited management scholars in the past three decades, results show that scholarly impact is a multidimensional construct and that the impact of scholarly research on internal stakeholders (i.e., other members of the Academy) cannot be equated with impact on external stakeholders (i.e., those outside the Academy). We illustrate these results with tables showing important changes in the rank ordering of individuals based on whether we operationalize impact considering internal stakeholders (i.e., number of citations) or external stakeholders (i.e., number of non-.edu Web pages). Also, we provide tables listing the most influential scholars inside the Academy who also have an important impact outside the Academy. We discuss implications for empirical research, theory development, and practice regarding the meaning and measurement of scholarly impact.","['nanEXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'UNIVERSITY', 'CITATIONS', 'FIELD', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PSYCHOLOGY', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['management', 'citations', 'field']",management
"Advertisers want to get consumers to love the advertised products, but they often try to do this by annoying them with unwelcome and disruptive advertising. This creates a possible contradiction between the negative feelings elicited by the advertising and the positive feelings the consumers are supposed to develop towards the advertised products. One may assume that the negative feelings towards annoying advertising are transferred to the advertised brands. This assumption was tested in a series of five experiments. Participants were disrupted by annoying pop-up ads while playing a popular computer game. In a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test, participants were required to choose between advertised and new brands. The advertised brands were preferred over the new brands, even though the ads were perceived as annoying. The positive effects of disruptive advertising can be attributed to the enhanced fluency of advertised brands. These findings demonstrate that disruptive advertising can be effective in increasing brand preferences, which may help to explain the widespread use of this type of advertising in practice. However, before recommending the use of disruptive advertising, it should be taken into consideration that it may also have undesirable side effects such as increasing advertising avoidance.

"International organizations, ranging from large MNCs to small born global firms, are increasingly recognizing that multicultural employees can help them operate across countries and across cultures. However, multiculturals individuals who identify with and internalize more than one culture - are a diverse group, and organizations seeking to leverage their potential can benefit from a deeper understanding of the resources they possess and the challenges they face. We conducted three studies with a total of 1196 participants to test relationships between multicultural identity patterns and personal, social and task outcomes. Consistent results across studies indicated that individuals with more cultural identities (higher identity plurality) had more social capital and higher levels of intercultural skills than those with fewer cultural identities, while individuals who integrated their cultural identities (higher identity integration) experienced higher levels of personal well-being than those who separated them. Based on these results we advocate for two directions in future research on multicultural employees: moving beyond cognitive mechanisms alone, and examining monocultural and multicultural individuals simultaneously along the spectrum of identity plurality.","['multicultural', 'bicultural', 'multiple identities', 'survey method', 'multiple regression analysis', 'social cognition', 'social identity theoryBICULTURAL IDENTITY INTEGRATION', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY', 'MULTIPLE IDENTITIES', 'THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES', 'INTERNATIONAL ADJUSTMENT', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT', 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE', 'PERCEIVED STRESS', 'GLOBAL TEAMS', 'IN-GROUP']",['multicultural'],
"Research summary: The efforts of multinational corporations to be socially responsible do not always engender positive evaluations from overseas stakeholders. Drawing on attribution theory, we argue that two heuristics guide stakeholders in evaluating firms' social performance: foreignness and the valence of firms' social responsibility. We provide evidence from a field study of secondary stakeholders and an experimental study involving 129 non-governmental organizations. Consistent with attribution theory, the liability of foreignness is minimized when firms engage in do-good social responsibility (focused on proactive engagement creating positive externalities) but is substantial when firms engage in do-no-harm social responsibility (focused on attenuating negative externalities). In online supporting information, Appendix S1, we demonstrate that these evaluations have consequences for whether stakeholders subsequently cooperate, or sow conflict, with firms. Managerial summary: There is no guarantee that efforts to be socially responsible will improve multinational corporations' relations with overseas stakeholders, such as customers, governments, and activists. In a field study and an experiment, we unpack when foreign firms suffer from harsh stakeholder evaluations. Foreign firms especially suffer from harsh evaluations when they conduct do-no-harm CSR rather than do-good CSR. Stakeholders attribute the motive for foreign firms' do-no-harm CSR to managerial interests and shareholder pressures, perceiving a wedge between managers and owners (who may be unmotivated to reduce the negative impacts of their business activities) and local stakeholders (who bear the social costs). A practical implication is that foreign firms gain more from highlighting do-good rather than do-(no)-harm CSR initiatives.

"Because the literature on platform competition emphasizes the role of network effects, it prescribes rapidly expanding a network of platform users and complementary applications to capture entire markets. We challenge the unconditional logic of a winner-take-all (WTA) approach by empirically analyzing the dominant strategies used to build and position platform systems in the U.S. video game industry. We show that when platform firms pursue two popular WTA strategies concurrently and with equal intensity (growing the number and variety of applications while also securing a larger fraction of those applications with exclusivity agreements), it diminishes the benefits of each strategy to the point that it lowers platform performance. We also show that a differentiation strategy based on distinctive positioning improves a platform's performance only when a platform system is highly distinctive relative to its rivals. Our results suggest that platform competition is shaped by important strategic trade-offs and that the WTA approach will not be universally successful.

"The managerial cognition perspective argues that managers operating in complex, dynamic environments develop knowledge structures that help them focus their attention, interpretation, and actions. We explore the content and structure of top managers' strategic knowledge structures by measuring differences in the level of attention they give in annual reports to strategic issues and themes that Miles and Snow used to describe their main strategic types. Twenty-one themes that form seven main factors describing managers' strategic cognition are identified, and these demonstrate reasonable fit with the Miles and Snow model. We show that expert raters can recognize these factors when they read annual reports that contain them. Cluster analysis is then used to identify groups of firms that share similar profiles on these strategic dimensions which are interpreted as examples of cognitive strategic groups. These groups show alignment with Miles and Snow's strategic types, are relatively stable over time, and differ in financial performance. The sample comprises 1, 038 listed Australian firms between the years 1992 and 2003.

"In recent years, researchers have recognized the importance of the concept of effect size for planning research, determining the significance of research results, and accumulating results across studies. However, the uncritical use of effect-size indicators may lead to different interpretations of similar research findings because of differences in assumptions underlying the nature of the research, aspects of the phenomenon being investigated, or the methodological characteristics of the research. This article reviews the substantive, measurement, and methodological issues that influence the relative magnitude of an empirical effect size, The relationships and transformations between different types of effect-size indicators are presented. It is the thesis of this article that the meaningfulness of an estimated effect size should be interpreted with consideration of the type of research (relational vs, experimental), the anticipated application of the results obtained (effects application vs. theory testing), and the research history in the domain of inquiry. Researchers must be cognizant of the many different causal factors that influence effect size before using the magnitude of an effect for assessing the importance of research results, calculating the statistical power of a test, or synthesizing findings across different studies.","['nanTHEORY TESTS', 'MARKETING-RESEARCH', 'BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS', 'VARIANCE', 'MAGNITUDE', 'POWER']","['magnitude', 'power']",effect size
"This empirical paper presents the results of a detailed case-study investigation of co-creation in radical service innovation. The rationale for the paper is that detailed interventions must be tracked to offer a realistic account of how co-creation occurs. This provides a strong empirical contribution to the emerging body of scholars developing the co-creation paradigm, predominantly characterized by conceptual advances in service-dominant logic. Our focus is on radical service innovation, which is disruptive in the sector. The overall aim of the paper is to unravel the nature of microlevel processes of co-creation in radical service innovation. The study adopts sequential analysis to examine co-creation. Patterns of sequences of actions and interactions associated with 40 incremental developments, involving multiple actors, are investigated. These co-created innovative developments underpin the emergence of a radical telematics-based motor insurance service. The findings suggest that the co-creation path is not simple or uni-faceted, and the paper unravels the nature of complex patterns of activities and interactions, Our in-depth systematic analysis illuminates a combination approach with two main patterns of sequences: one dominated by ad-hoc and enduring independent innovation activities by network actors and one dominated by lead-firm innovation and interaction activity. The findings advance knowledge of the way co-creation occurs in radical service innovation. The study results suggest that managerial attention be placed to, first, finding ways to induce independent innovative behavior from network partners and, second, to the development of interaction mechanisms to foster sharing and visualization of such innovation advances.","['nanDOMINANT LOGIC', 'NETWORK', 'EXCHANGE', 'USERS']",['network'],co creation innovation dominant logic
"Marketers often seek to minimize or eliminate interruptions when they deliver persuasive messages in an attempt to increase consumers' attention and processing of those messages. However, in five studies conducted across different experimental contexts and different content domains, the current research reveals that interruptions that temporarily disrupt a persuasive message can increase consumers' processing of that message. As a result, consumers can be more persuaded by interrupted messages than they would be by the exact same messages delivered uninterrupted. In documenting this effect, the current research departs from past research illuminating the negative effects of interruptions, and delineates the mechanism through which and conditions under which momentary interruptions can promote persuasion.","['interruption', 'persuasion', 'attitude changeATTITUDE CERTAINTY', 'ADVERTISING EFFECTIVENESS', 'COGNITIVE RESPONSES', 'NEED', 'INFORMATION', 'RESISTANCE', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'AROUSAL', 'ELABORATION', 'DETERMINANT']","['interruption', 'persuasion']",interruptions attention persuasion

"Organizational scholars concur that supportive work relationships can attach employees to their workplace and improve the quality of organizational life, but they lack insights into how or why this occurs. Moreover, models of social support focus on what relationships provide without considering the fit between what people need and receive from their work relationships. Addressing these limitations, we developed and tested a theoreticalmodel of relational attachment at work using a complementary fit perspective. After validating measures, we tested, extended, and replicated our model in three field studies. Results revealed that employees became more attached to their organization and experienced more beneficial outcomes when they had stronger psychological attachment to others at work. This relational attachment was not driven by general social support, but, rather, by relational needs fit, which reflects employees' experience of having their needs met by their work relationships. However, receiving more personal support than what was wanted or needed intruded into employees' privacy boundaries and created a too close for comfort reaction whereby they pulled back from their work relationships. This too much of a good thing finding indicates that, while positive relationships at work are effective, social support should be tailored to individuals' needs.","['nanPERSON-ENVIRONMENT FIT', 'SOCIAL SUPPORT', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY', 'INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS', 'POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS', 'INSTRUMENTAL SUPPORT', 'VOLUNTARY TURNOVER', 'NEGATIVE REACTIONS', 'EMOTIONAL SUPPORT', 'MEMBER EXCHANGE']","['social support', 'social support', 'positive relationships', 'positive relationships']",workplace support

"Customers often decide between service providers on the basis of their anticipated waiting times. The duration of the wait depends on two factors: the customer processing speed at the service location and the level of congestion at the time of arrival. While processing speed is an intrinsic operating characteristic of a service provider, congestion is a contingent characteristic that depends on customers' choices between the service provider and its competitors. Consequently, a customer's waiting time at a service location is characterized by an externality because it depends on the concurrent choices made by other customers. In this article, the authors examine how customers account for this externality when choosing between service providers that differ in the uncertainty surrounding their service times. The authors show that the uncertainty surrounding anticipated congestion at service locations suppresses risk aversion with respect to service times. However, if the overall market is expected to be over- or undercrowded, then risk aversion is restored and customer choices favor the low-uncertainty service provider. A partial explanation for the variance in customers' decision strategies lies in the extent to which they focus on the arrival process versus the service process when making their decision.","['waiting time', 'service design', 'queues', 'decision making', 'congestion', 'crowd avoidanceRISK', 'QUEUES', 'DISCREPANCIES', 'CONSUMERS', 'AMBIGUITY']","['waiting time', 'waiting time', 'congestion']",processing speed congestion congestion choices uncertainty

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to highlight the efforts of a leading Turkish automotive company to restructure its supply chain for export parts. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents hand-on experiences of a pilot project conducted at Tofas-Fiat automotive company to redesign its logistics operations and to select a global logistics service provider, using an analytic hierarchy process for multi-criteria decision-making. Findings - 3PL providers in Turkey must improve their capabilities and act proactively in providing value-adding services as the companies are becoming more demanding in their expectations in building strategic relationships. Research limitations/implications - The focus of the paper is on automotive supply chain for export parts, but the analysis as well as 3PL selection methodology may be successfully applied to other products in different settings and in other sectors. Practical implications - Companies must determine logistics goals and requirements prior to taking on a 3PL. The defined objectives will help to establish the criteria for 3PL selection. Some of these include IT capability, service quality, customer relationship, and cultural fit. This analysis helps the company to define the problem with its differing aspects rather than only financial considerations, to reflect the common mind of the team, to resolve conflicts between the differentiated departmental goals, and to bring objectivity to decisions via an analytical approach. Originality/value - This paper provides some practical insights from an automotive company that attempts to streamline and efficiently run its supply chain through logistics outsourcing.","['distribution management', 'outsourcing', 'decision making', 'automotive industry', 'Turkeynan']","['outsourcing', 'decision making', 'decision making']",design project decision capabilities
"We draw on relative deprivation theory to examine how the context influences the relationship between employees' perceptions of gender discrimination and outcomes at work using a meta-analysis and two complementary empirical studies. Our meta-analysis includes 85 correlations from published and unpublished studies from around the world to assess correlates of perceived workplace gender discrimination that have significant implications for employees. We extend relative deprivation theory to identify national differences in labor laws and cultural norms as contextual factors that affect the threshold for feeling deprived and moderate the relationship between perceived workplace gender discrimination and employee outcomes. Findings show that perceived gender discrimination is negatively related to job attitudes, physical health outcomes and behaviors, psychological health, and work-related outcomes (job-based and relationship-based). Correlations between perceived workplace gender discrimination and physical health outcomes and behaviors were stronger in countries with more broadly integrated labor policies and stringently enforced labor practices focused on promoting gender equality. Correlations were also stronger in countries with more gender-egalitarian cultural practices across multiple employee outcomes of perceived workplace gender discrimination. Further, results from two complementary studies (one employee survey and one experiment) supported the meta-analytic findings and provided evidence of the relative deprivation rationale central to our theory. Implications for research and practice include the need to consider the influence of the country context in organizational decisions to prevent and address gender discrimination and its consequences for employees and ultimately, for employers.","['relative deprivation theory', 'gender discrimination', 'job attitudes', 'physical health outcomes and behaviors', 'psychological health', 'job-related outcomes', 'country context', 'cultureSEXUAL-HARASSMENT', 'METHOD VARIANCE', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'WORK', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'COMMITMENT', 'DIVERSITY', 'JUSTICE', 'HEALTH']","['relative deprivation theory', 'relative deprivation theory', 'relative deprivation theory', 'gender discrimination', 'gender discrimination', 'job attitudes', 'job attitudes', 'physical health outcomes and behaviors', 'physical health outcomes and behaviors', 'physical health outcomes and behaviors', 'physical health outcomes and behaviors', 'physical health outcomes and behaviors', 'psychological health', 'psychological health', 'country context', 'country context', 'work', 'perceptions', 'health']",relative deprivation gender discrimination meta analysis attitudes
"The authors define the Big Middle as the marketspace in which the bulk of retailers compete for the majority of customers and the preponderance of expenditures occur. Therefore, it is the space in which retailers aspire to exist in their quest for increased revenues, scale economics, and profits. An enduring concept, the Big Middle appears in any economy in which large-scale retailing has developed. In general merchandise retailing in the U.S., there have been three Big Middle subperiods, each defined by a distinct branch of the general merchandising tree; driven by geographic, technological, and socioeconomic changes; and dominated by preeminent retail chains. During the variety store subperiod, the F.W. Woolworth chain dominated. In the national-chain department store subperiod, Sears Roebuck and JCPenney were the primary retailers, and in the modern discounter subperiod, Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Target have emerged as leaders. The authors argue that the development of these subperiods and the success of their major retailers have depended on the efficient and effective flow of merchandise from suppliers to customers. Optimizing this flow always has entailed harnessing current technology, given the geographic and socioeconomic realities of the time. Currently, technology facilitates a comprehensive application of supply chain management, whereas previous technology only permitted a simplified version. (c) 2005 New York University.

"Although many start-ups struggle to grow partly due to institutional voids in transitioning economies, empirical observations have contradicted this dominant view in the literature in that even with deficient formal institutions many economies(e.g., China) have high rates of entrepreneurship in recent years. To understand this paradox, we propose a politically contingent view of the relationship between the institutional environment and entrepreneurs' reinvestment in their business. Our empirical study of entrepreneurs in China shows that the impact of institutional deterioration on entrepreneurial reinvestment substantially hinges on entrepreneurs' political connections. As such, institutional deterioration does not reduce entrepreneurial reinvestment for all entrepreneurs; rather, when entrepreneurs have political connections they are willing to reinvest in their business despite a weakening institutional environment.

"Attracting talent with international capabilities is critical for the internationalization of business schools and other knowledge-intensive service-industry organizations. However, limited coverage beyond the top cohort of business schools in existing research-based rankings does not allow the majority of institutions to use these rankings as global signaling systems of their research performance. This is particularly detrimental to the development of younger research fields, such as International Business (IB). Our Global Research Performance (GRP) system affords visibility to 1029 institutions that publish in seven prominent IB journals and to a broader cohort of 3352 institutions that publish in 149 high-impact business and management journals. GRP empowers IB and other scholars to demonstrate their contribution to their organizations' legitimacy and promotes a data driven approach to international talent recruitment.","['International business research performance', 'International hiring', 'Business schools', 'Research performance', 'Signaling theory', 'Global mobilityPROFESSIONAL SERVICE FIRMS', 'APPLICANT ATTRACTION', 'KNOWLEDGE WORKERS', 'JOURNAL QUALITY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'RANKINGS', 'FIELD', 'LANGUAGE', 'MOBILITY']","['business schools', 'business schools', 'research performance', 'research performance', 'management', 'organizations', 'rankings', 'field']",business schools organizations based rankings research performance journals management talent recruitment
"There is considerable disagreement about whether family firm characteristics hinder or support entrepreneurial activities. This article highlights the existence of an entrepreneurial orientation in family firms, and it examines differences between family and nonfamily firms on the entrepreneurial orientation dimensions of autonomy, competitive aggressiveness, innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk taking, using content analysis of shareholder letters from S&P 500 firms. As such, family firms exhibit language consistent with an entrepreneurial orientation for all dimensions but use less language than that of nonfamily firms in relation to autonomy, proactiveness, and risk taking.","['entrepreneurial orientation', 'family firms', 'content analysisRISK-TAKING', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONFLICT', 'COMPENSATION', 'OWNERSHIP', 'CONSTRUCT', 'DYNAMICS', 'VALIDITY']","['entrepreneurial orientation', 'entrepreneurial orientation', 'family firms', 'family firms']",nonfamily autonomy
"Selling alliances that are formed to cooperatively develop and maintain customer relationships are among the new organizational forms that marketing managers utilize for competitive advantage. To be successful, these alliances require sales representatives from allied organizations to work effectively as selling partners. The authors develop a trust-based model of effective selling partner relationships and test it in the context of the computer industry. Partial Least Squares analysis of 103 dyadic relationships found that organizational differences were modest predictors of three dimensions of mutual perceived trustworthiness, which in turn differentially affected three trusting behaviors. Trusting behaviors were found to have a somewhat greater effect on perceived task performance than on mutual satisfaction, whereas dimensions of trustworthiness had both direct and indirect effects on satisfaction. The authors discuss the managerial and theoretical implications of these results.","['nanSTRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS', 'MEASUREMENT ERROR', 'INFORMANT REPORTS', 'MARKET-RESEARCH', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'COMMITMENT', 'ALLIANCES', 'BEHAVIOR']","['alliances', 'behavior']",trust model trustworthiness performance
"Technology has recently begun to be explored as a way to cope with the challenges related to the aging of the population. However, while many technological systems for older adults have entered the market, the rate of adoption is low despite the potential benefits they intend to provide. The market response suggests that older adults' adoption of technology is not simply a matter of performance and price, but a complex issue that is affected by multiple factors. To address the issue in a more comprehensive way, this review study identifies factors that influence older adults' perceptions and decisions around adoption and use of technology-enabled products and services with an integration of related findings from various fields. Based on a survey of related studies, 10 factorsvalue, usability, affordability, accessibility, technical support, social support, emotion, independence, experience, and confidenceare identified as the facilitators or determinants of older adults' adoption of technology. While previous studies have focused on detailed design and physical ease-of-use, the 10 factors provide a holistic framework that covers social contexts of use and delivery and communication channels as well as individual characteristics and technical features. This paper describes the factors with empirical evidence and design implications. The goal of this paper is to provide a base for a more comprehensive understanding of older adults as users and consumers of technology; to inform designers, developers, and managers about practical implications; and to set a research agenda for future studies in related fields.","['nanAGE-DIFFERENCES', 'INFORMATION', 'ACCEPTANCE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'MOTIVATIONS', 'USABILITY', 'DIFFUSION', 'EXTENSION', 'ATTITUDES']","['perceptions', 'usability']",challenges older performance designers
"Women-owned businesses are the fastest growing sector of new venture ownership in the United States. Although women's access to, and use of, debt and venture capital financing have been explored, comparatively little is known about women's access to capital from private equity investors. In this paper, we examine the equality of women's access to angel capital. The research suggests that women seek angel financing at rates substantially lower than that of men, but have an equal probability of receiving investment. We also document that women are more likely to seek, and to a lesser extent receive, financing from women angels. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

"This study investigates what leads managers to allocate constrained cognitive effort toward new versus familiar aspects of a business. Specifically, we explore advice giving by venture capital firms (VCs) to their portfolio companies, distinguishing between business topics on which a VC has advised other ventures in the past and topics new to the VC that may be outside its areas of expertise. We use both demand-side (venture-driven) and supply-side (VC-driven) perspectives to offer a novel theory about the antecedents of cognitive effort underlying advice giving. Empirical tests in a unique data set of French VCs show that both perspectives explain important aspects of advice-giving dynamics for VCs. VCs facing dynamic environments and capacity constraints strongly respond to stimuli from ventures, but VCs also adjust their behavior as they accumulate experience in ways that reflect both expanding confidence in their ability to add value and concerns about overextension of their efforts, depending on the valence of VC experience. Our findings provide important insights to the antecedents of cognitive effort and to research on the VC-venture relationship by exploring the dynamics of how advice-giving relationships evolve over time as VCs gain experience.","['managerial cognitive effort', 'managerial cognition', 'advice giving', 'venture capital', 'learning from experience', 'cognitive constraintsLIMITED ATTENTION', 'BEHAVIORAL-THEORY', 'STRATEGIC ACTION', 'BUSINESS MODEL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CEO', 'EXPERIENCE', 'EXPLORATION', 'BOARD', 'ENTREPRENEURS']","['advice giving', 'advice giving', 'venture capital', 'venture capital', 'experience']",firms environments research
"Previous studies on strategic groups have mainly focused on their static characteristics in order to test the theory of strategic groups and intraindustry performance differences (Porter, 1979; Cool and Schendel, 1988; Fiegenbaum and Thomas, 1990). In contrast, this study takes a longitudinal, dynamic perspective and describes the forces driving strategic group membership and structural evolution. It proposes that a strategic group acts as a reference point for group members in formulating competitive strategy. A partial adjustment model of strategic mobility is then developed which incorporates the idea of a strategic group as a reference group. It models strategic change in an industry both within and across strategic groups. The model is tested in the context of an in-depth industry analysis of the more significant firms in the insurance industry over the 1970-84 time period. The results suggest that strategic groups act as reference points for firm strategies and that predictions of future firm strategies and industry/group structures may also be successfully derived.","['STRATEGIC GROUPS', 'INDUSTRY DYNAMICS', 'REFERENCE GROUPS', 'STRATEGIC CHANGEMOBILITY BARRIERS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'PERSPECTIVE']","['strategic groups', 'strategic groups', 'performance', 'perspective']",industry
"A number of more contextual and process-oriented approaches have been followed recently in entrepreneurial research, including the cognitive approach, the learning approach and the evolutionary approach. This paper reviews the evolutionary approach to the study of entrepreneurship. This includes an overview of evolutionary theory and the arguments behind its relevance to the study of socio-economics systems, as well as a review of the application of evolutionary theory to the study of entrepreneurship at both the population level (population ecology) and the organizational level (strategic choice). The reconciliation of these two perspectives is discussed, and comparisons are made with the cognition-based and learning-based approaches. It is argued in this paper that an evolutionary approach to the study of entrepreneurship leads to more theory-driven research with a strong focus on process and context. In addition, it offers more than both the cognition-based and learning-based approaches because it allows for multi-level analyses of the new venture creation process, encompassing both the population ecology (population level) and strategic choice (organizational level) perspective, and the resultant interactions between both hierarchies, giving valuable insight into the same overall evolutionary process.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING FRAMEWORK', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'ROUTINES', 'INDUSTRY', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'COMPLEXITY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'DARWINISM', 'KNOWLEDGE']",['perspective'],evolutionary population ecology
"Companies tend to begin their internationalization process in countries that are 'psychically' close. Researchers describe the sequence of entry that firms follow and the mode of entry they choose, They suggest that psychically close countries are more easily understood than distant ones; and offer more familiar operating environments, Although not prescriptive, an unstated conclusion can be drawn linking sequence of entry to performance. Evidence from thirty-two Canadian retail companies shows that only seven (22%) were functioning successfully in the United States, The psychic distance paradox is that operations in psychically close countries are not necessarily easy to manage, because assumptions of similarity can prevent executives from learning about critical differences, Moreover, empirical evidence from 271 CEOs confirms greater cultural differences between Canada and the U.S. than assumed previously. Modifications are suggested to improve the psychic distance concept.","['nanINTERNATIONALIZATION', 'STRATEGY', 'FIRM']",['firm'],united states

"This paper aims to highlight the opportunity to contribute to our understanding of strategic entrepreneurship by exploring the construct through the lens of agency theory. In particular, we claim a fundamental link between a new venture's control of critical resources and the distribution of equity between the principal and agent. According to agency theory, assigning top executives ownership in the firm provides arrangements that are compatible with the incentives of the owners of the firm. This paper suggests that agency theory has special relevance when considered in a strategic entrepreneurship context. This is because the function of managers in entrepreneurial new ventures is fundamentally different from their counterparts in large established, incumbent corporations. While both types of managers have to provide managerial and organizational expertise, managers in entrepreneurial new ventures have an additional function that is essential to the competitive advantage and performance of the new venture-providing knowledge and human capital, which, in many cases, is intrinsically linked to the capital resources of the new venture. Our framework is tested using patent ownership as a proxy for both relationship-specific investments and indispensable human capital of the top manager of the new venture. The empirical results support the main hypotheses posited by the entrepreneurial governance model. In particular, patent ownership of the top manager significantly increases the percentage of equity held, while the number of patents held by the firm significantly decreases the percentage of ownership.","['nanCORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'BOARD', 'FIRM', 'DECADES', 'COSTS', 'SMES']","['ownership', 'knowledge', 'firm']",
"Most research on creativity describes it as a net positive: producing new products for the organization and satisfaction and positive affect for creative workers. However, a host of anecdotal and historical evidence suggests that creative work can have deleterious consequences for relationships. This raises the question: how does creativity at work impact relationships at home? Relying on work-family conflict and resource allocation theory as conceptual frameworks, we test a model of creative behaviors during the day at work and the extent to which employees spend time with their spouses at home in the evening, using 685 daily matched responses from 108 worker-spouse pairings. Our results reveal that variance-focused creative behaviors (problem identification, information searching, idea generation) predict less time spent with a spouse at home. In contrast, selection-focused creative behaviors (idea validation) predict more time spent with a spouse. Further, openness to experience moderates these relationships. Overall, the results raise questions about the possible relational costs of creative behaviors at work on life at home.","['nanNEGATIVE AFFECT', 'SOCIAL SUPPORT', 'OPENNESS', 'EXPERIENCE', 'STRESS', 'RESOURCES', 'FAMILY', 'MODEL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MOTIVATION']","['openness', 'experience', 'family', 'model']",creativity workers family conflict experience
"The relationship between a firm's performance and R&D spending is often imperfectly understood, despite the fact that R&D is often a cornerstone of an effective innovation strategy. Susan Holak, Mark Parry, and Michael Song extend the classic innovation-adoption paradigm developed by Rogers and propose a series of hypotheses describing variations in the relationship between the R&D/sales ratio and a firm's performance. Using data from the PIMS database and contrasting growth-stage and mature-stage firms, the authors report that firm and industry characteristics have an important bearing on the R&D-performance relationship. In addition, managers can influence the incremental effects of added R&D spending on the firm's performance by manipulating certain firm-contingent variables. Increased R&D spending can have either a positive or negative influence on gross margin under various circumstances.","['nanPIONEER ADVANTAGES', 'GOODS INDUSTRIES', 'INNOVATION', 'PROFITABILITY', 'ADOPTION', 'SUCCESS']","['innovation', 'adoption']",r d spending ratio
"Purpose Despite several contributions to greenhouse gas emission and carbon footprint reduction, the literature lacks empirical insights into the business impact of climate risks, when they materialize, and techniques to manage them. This study aims to devise a model delving into critical climate risks and the role of consortia and social capital to mitigate these risks. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods approach was used, including qualitative and quantitative data from small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in an Australian agrifood supply chain (AFSC). Findings The qualitative analysis uncovers four critical climate risks and a repertoire of relational, structural, and cognitive social capital accrued by SMEs of AFSC through consortia. The quantitative analysis corroborates that the SMEs that accumulate higher social capital through active engagement within consortia are able to respond more effectively to climate risks than to others. The authors, therefore, find that climate risk mitigation in SMEs is the function of both association (consortia) membership and the accrual of higher social capital through active involvement and collaboration within networks. Originality/value This is the first study in using a moderated-moderation model that simultaneously investigates the business impact of climate risks and how the moderating impact of consortia (a primary moderator) is further moderated by social capital (a secondary moderator) in explaining SMEs performance. The paper addresses the lack of adequate empirical research, particularly mixed-methods, in supply chain risk management literature.","['Supply chain risks', 'Consortia', 'Agrifood', 'Mixed-methods', 'Three-way interaction', 'Social Capital', 'SMEs', 'Agriculture', 'Food industry', 'Supply riskDEVELOPMENT CONSORTIA', 'MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES', 'CARBON EMISSION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'RESILIENCE', 'IMPACT', 'OPPORTUNITIES', 'COORDINATION']","['consortia', 'agrifood', 'mixed methods', 'mixed methods', 'social capital', 'social capital', 'smes', 'performance', 'model', 'impact']",impact climate risks social mitigation

"Although prior research is congested with constructs intended to capture consumers' dispositions toward globalization and global/local products, their effects appear to replicate with difficulty, and little is known about the underlying theoretical mechanisms. This investigation revisits the relationship between prominent consumer dispositions (consumer ethnocentrism, cosmopolitanism, global/local identity, globalization attitude) and perceived brand globalness as determinants of consumer responses to global brands. Drawing on selective perception and social identity theories, the authors consider several theory-based model specifications that reflect alternative mechanisms through which key consumer dispositions relate to brand globalness and affect important brand-related outcomes. By employing a flexible model that simultaneously accounts for moderating, mediating, conditional, and direct effects, we empirically test these rival model specifications. A meta-analysis of 264 effect sizes obtained from 13 studies with 23 unique data sets and a total sample of 1,410 consumers raises concerns regarding the (potentially overstated) utility of consumer dispositions for explaining consumer responses to global brands. It also reveals a need for further conceptual contemplation of their function in international consumer research and managerial practice.","['consumer ethnocentrism', 'cosmopolitanism', 'global', 'local identity', 'perceived brand globalnessLOCAL BRANDS', 'IMPLICIT MEASURES', 'SOCIAL COGNITION', 'EXTENDED MODEL', 'HOME COUNTRY', 'METHOD BIAS', 'ATTITUDES', 'IDENTITY', 'ETHNOCENTRISM', 'COSMOPOLITANISM']","['consumer ethnocentrism', 'consumer ethnocentrism', 'cosmopolitanism', 'global', 'local identity', 'local identity', 'identity', 'ethnocentrism', 'cosmopolitanism']",globalization products consumer ethnocentrism cosmopolitanism global brands perception meta analysis
"Purpose This paper aims to investigate the relationships among supply chain management (SCM) implementation, human resource management (HRM) practices and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) firm performance in Thailand. It further examines whether HRM practices have a mediating effect on such relationship. Design/methodology/approach A survey instrument was developed based on the literature review which then was verified by SCM expert opinions. Cross-sectional surveys of sample employees of SMEs in Thailand were undertaken by both direct and mail surveys. Of about 779 questionnaires distributed, 203 usable questionnaires were returned. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to analyze the obtained data. Findings The statistical results reveal that SCM indirectly improves firm performance of small- and medium-sized firms through HRM practices. The latter, HRM practices, is found to fully mediate the impact of SCM implementation on SME firm performance. These results suggest that SCM cannot enhance SME firm performance if its implementation is undertaken without effective HRM practices. Originality/value This study identified the research gap in SCM areas by recognizing the scarcity of research on SCM in SMEs and by identifying and integrating HRM practices as a significant behavioral support system to SCM implementation in SMEs. Its results reveal that HRM practices fully mediates the impact of SCM on SMEs' firm performance.","['Supply chain management', 'Human resource management', 'Structural equation modeling (SEM)', 'Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)', 'Empirical research', 'Mediating effect', 'Thailand', 'Emerging economy', 'Developing countriesSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT', 'TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'IMPACT', 'BUSINESS', 'COORDINATION', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'LOGISTICS']","['supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'human resource management', 'human resource management', 'human resource management', 'structural equation modeling sem ', 'structural equation modeling sem ', 'structural equation modeling sem ', 'structural equation modeling sem ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'mediating effect', 'mediating effect', 'thailand', 'impact']",supply chain management practices
"Problem solving, a process of seeking, defining, evaluating, and implementing the solutions, is considered a converter that can translate organizational inputs into valuable product and service outputs. A key challenge for the product innovation community is to answer questions about how knowledge competence and problem-solving competence develop and sustain competitive advantage. The objective of this study is to theoretically examine and empirically test an existing assumption that problem-solving competence is an important variable connecting market knowledge competence with new product performance. New product projects from 396 firms in the high-technology zones in China were used to test the study's theoretical model. The results first indicate that problem-solving speed and creativity matter in new product innovation performance by playing mediator roles between market knowledge competence and positional advantage, which in turn sustains superior performance. This new insight suggest that mere generation of market knowledge and having a marketing-research and development (R&D) interface will not affect new product performance unless project members have the ability to use the information and to interact to identify and solve complex problems speedily and creatively. Second, these results suggest that different market knowledge competences (customers, competitors, and interactions between marketing and R&D) have distinct impacts on problem-solving speed and creativity (positive, negative, or none), which underscore the need to embrace a more fine-grained notion of market knowledge competence. The results also reveal that the relative importance of some of these relationships depends on the perceived level of turbulence in the environment. First, competitor knowledge competence decreases problem-solving speed when perceived environmental turbulence is low but enhances problem-solving speed when perceived turbulence is high. Second, competitor knowledge competence has a positive relationship with new product performance when the environmental turbulence is high but no relationship when the environmental turbulence is low. Third, the positive relationship between problem-solving speed and product advantage is stronger when the perceived environmental turbulence is high than when it is low, which implies that problem solving is more important for creating product advantage when environmental turbulence is high and change is fast and unpredictable. Fourth, the negative relationship between problem-solving speed and new product performance is stronger when the perceived environmental turbulence is high than when it is low, which means that problem-solving speed is more harmful for new product performance when change is fast and unpredictable. And fifth, the positive relationship between product quality and new product performance is stronger when perceived environmental turbulence is low than when it is high, which implies that product quality may more likely lead to new product performance when the environment is stable and changes are easy to predict, analyze, and comprehend.","['nanMARKET ORIENTATION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'CENTRIPETAL FORCES', 'INNOVATION', 'QUALITY', 'CAPABILITIES', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'ADVANTAGE', 'CENTRIFUGAL', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['innovation', 'quality', 'advantage', 'knowledge']",firms china creativity interface information
"We draw from cognitive science literature on rule-based thinking to develop and empirically test a theoretical framework of entrepreneurial opportunity evaluation. We argue that entrepreneurs make use of socially constructed rules to discern the attractiveness of an opportunity, for them, specifically. Using conjoint analysis data of 498 decisions made by 62 entrepreneurs, we find that entrepreneurs' use of rules regarding opportunity novelty, resource efficiency, and worst-case scenario significantly influences entrepreneurs' evaluations of opportunities and that individual differences in opportunity market and technology knowledge augment the effect of the rules on opportunity attractiveness. Additionally, we document that the worst-case scenario diminishes the positive effect of other rule criteria (e.g. novelty, resource efficiency) on opportunity evaluation and that market and technology knowledge further influence the negative effects of the worst-case scenario.","['opportunity', 'evaluation', 'rule-based decision making', 'entrepreneurship', 'cognitionSTRATEGIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITY', 'MODEL', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'MANAGERIAL', 'CONSTRUCT', 'COGNITION', 'EMOTIONS']","['opportunity', 'evaluation', 'entrepreneurial opportunity', 'entrepreneurial opportunity', 'construct']",decisions knowledge

"Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to present the findings of supplier selection activities in a service sector organisation in Nigeria. It aims to examine the role of normative forces within the context of Institutional Theory. Design/methodology/approach-A single case study approach was used. Action research utilising participant observation was used in data collection. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS. Findings-Criteria relating to corporate social responsibility (CSR) proved to be a significant weakness for Nigerian suppliers, as most of the bidding organisations were unable to show evidence of, for example, payment of taxes and insurance for their employees. However, suppliers of services, in general, performed better than suppliers of products. Practical implications-Suppliers of products and services in Nigeria need to improve their performance with respect to CSR in particular. As most of these organisations are small businesses, they had previously tended to avoid the costs related to CSR implementation. Furthermore, large customer organisations can utilise their buying power and influence to encourage their suppliers to change their corporate strategies and practices. Originality/value-The selection of suppliers within the study context has previously not been examined. There has been little understanding of the capabilities of suppliers of minor products and services, particularly in relation to fulfilling CSR obligations.","['Nigeria', 'Purchasing', 'Suppliers', 'Selection', 'Corporate social responsibility', 'Institutional theory', 'Supplier selectionCHAIN', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PROCUREMENT', 'CHALLENGES', 'INSIGHTS', 'IMPACT', 'ISSUES', 'CSR']","['nigeria', 'suppliers', 'selection', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'institutional theory', 'institutional theory', 'performance', 'csr']",supplier selection nigeria csr
"The authors develop an econometric model of the relationship between a household's private-label (PL) share and its behavioral store loyalty. The model includes major drivers of these two behaviors and controls for simultaneity and nonlinearity in the relationship between them. The model is estimated with a unique data set that combines complete purchase records of a panel of Dutch households with demographic and psychographic data. The authors estimate the model for two retail chains in the Netherlands-the leading service chain with a well-differentiated high-share PL and the leading value chain with a lower-share PL. They find that PL share significantly affects all three measures of behavioral loyalty in the study: share of wallet, share of items purchased, and share of shopping trips. In addition, behavioral loyalty has a significant effect on PL share. For the service chain, the authors find that both effects are in the form of an inverted U. For the value chain, the effects are positive and nonlinear, but they do not exhibit nonmonotonicity, because PL share has not yet reached high enough levels. The managerial implications of this research are important. Retailers can reap the benefits of a virtuous cycle; greater PL share increases share of wallet, and greater share of wallet increases PL share. However, this virtuous cycle operates only to a point because heavy PL buyers tend to be loyal to price savings and PLs in general, not to the PL of any particular chain.","['private labels', 'store brands', 'store loyalty', 'share of wallet', 'simultaneity', 'nonlinear effectsBRANDS', 'CONSUMER', 'SYSTEMS', 'ENTRY', 'SHARE']","['store loyalty', 'store loyalty', 'share of wallet', 'share of wallet', 'share of wallet', 'simultaneity', 'share']",behavioral store loyalty price
"This critical review of the literature on female entrepreneurship problematizes the metanarrative of economic growth and the mechanisms through which it both operates and is maintained. Central to this is the axiomatic 'underperformance hypothesis', which states that 'all else being equal, female entrepreneurs tend to be less successful than their male counterparts in terms of conventional economic performance measures' (Du Rietz and Henrekson (2000, p. 1). As an axiom, the truth of the 'underperformance hypothesis' is taken for granted, and thus it invisibly serves as a starting point, delimiter and interpretive lens for analysis in this field. While it remains invisible, the hypothesis will continue to reproduce the differences between male and female entrepreneurs, and thus the subordination of women to men in the realm of entrepreneurship. The review illustrates how, by associating females with underperformance, the persistent influence of the metanarrative of economic growth has been masked and the image of the female entrepreneur as problematic and inferior to her male counterpart has been reinforced. The authors argue that a postmodern feminist epistemology will destabilize both the metanarrative of economic growth, and the axiomatic 'underperformance hypothesis' it supports, thus opening up space for a heterogeneous understanding of (female) entrepreneurship. By questioning accepted knowledge about female entrepreneurs, the review sets the platform for the exploration of new research questions and a broad agenda for future research. Such an agenda is crucial in order to move future research beyond the pervasive influence of the metanarrative of economic growth and its attendant underperformance hypothesis.","['nanWOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS', 'BANK LOAN OFFICERS', 'SELF-EMPLOYMENT', 'GENDER-DIFFERENCES', 'ADVANCING DEBATE', 'ONE SIZE', 'MEN', 'NETWORKING', 'MOTIVATIONS', 'PERFORMANCE']","['men', 'performance']",female performance

This study examines the impact of network centrality on firm's internationalization behavior within the ISA domain in response to the performance-aspiration gap. We build on social and behavioral perspectives to predict that network centrality and performance-based aspirations will be associated with the number of ISA the firm engages in.

"This article demonstrates that a loss of personal control leads to an increase in self-regulatory behavior. This occurs because a loss of control puts consumers at a deficit relative to one of the major lessons they learn during their childhood, which is to have control over the outcomes of their actions. This deficit triggers a compensatory process focused on following other lessons that consumers believe they learned during their childhood. Because exerting self-regulation is another major lesson parents emphasize, consumers engage in self-regulatory behavior to compensate for a loss of personal control. However, when consumers believe their parents emphasized self-regulation less strongly during childhood (i. e., they believe their parents had a more permissive style), a loss of control can reduce self-regulatory behavior. These findings have implications for what we know about the effects of childhood experiences on adult consumer behavior, the importance of individuals' beliefs about childhood experiences in determining adult behavior, the consequences of low personal control, and the antecedents of self-regulatory behavior.","['childhood socialization', 'personal control', 'self-regulation', 'self-control', 'compensatory behaviorCONSUMER-SOCIALIZATION', 'COMPENSATORY CONTROL', 'BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS', 'EATING DISORDERS', 'PARENTING STYLE', 'IMPULSE CONTROL', 'CHILDREN', 'MOTHERS', 'GOALS', 'CONSUMPTION']","['personal control', 'personal control', 'self regulation', 'self regulation']",regulatory behavior
"This study investigates the effect of call-to-action (CTA) direct mailings (DMs) on customers' purchase behavior and how this effect is moderated by incentive type as well as customer characteristics. The authors analyze individual purchase behavior of a panel of 179,525 customers across 40 Dutch optical retailers over 9 years. The empirical results show that CTA DMs that include an incentive have a higher positive impact on customer's purchase probability compared with those without an incentive. Furthermore, non-monetary incentives, especially utilitarian ones, have a higher positive impact than monetary incentives. Our results also show that customer heterogeneity plays an important role in the influence of CTA DMs on purchase incidence. More specifically, CTA DMs have a higher impact on purchase incidence for customers with higher past purchase frequency, lower purchase recency, longer relationship duration and for customers who received DM more recently and frequently. The results of the study provide valuable insights for managers allocating their direct marketing budget: it is better to use non-monetary (preferably utilitarian) incentives and to target customers based on relationship history as well as DM history.

Two studies show that consumers' post-purchase evaluations of products, which yield a mixed attribute performance, tend to be more favorable under lenient return policies than under restricted return policies when retailers offer recommendations during the pre-purchase decision-making process, but more favorable under restricted return policies than under lenient return policies when retailers offer no recommendations.

"Design thinking comprises an approach to problem solving that uses tools traditionally utilized by designers of commercial products, processes, and environments (e.g., designing a new car or the layout of a new airport). While design thinking was originally introduced as an approach that would work best when infused into the culture of an organization, most early studies of design thinking focused on identifying the specific tools and methods that might be used to solve management problems. Only recently have researchers examined how the implementation of design thinking might relate to organizational-level constructs, such as organizational culture. In this review, we examine empirical research (mostly from the past decade) that relates the practice of design thinking to the development of culture in organizations. Through this review, we identify how the use of specific design thinking tools supports the development of specific organizational cultures and vice versa. In addition, we identify how using design thinking tools produces emotional experiences and physical artifacts that help users to understand why and how specific cultures support the effective use of specific tools. Together, our review findings suggest that the experiential nature of design thinking tools and cultures (i.e., that they require people to actively engage in hands-on work) allows them to support one another. On the basis of this insight, we develop a general framework for organizing design thinking research and identify a number of avenues for future research that might advance our understanding of design thinking in organizational contexts.","['design thinking', 'design', 'organizational culture', 'experiential learning', 'artifacts', 'emotionPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'INNOVATION CAPABILITY', 'INDUSTRIAL-DESIGN', 'MIRROR NEURONS', 'RADICAL INNOVATION', 'SENSEMAKING', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FIRM', 'STRATEGY']","['design thinking', 'design thinking', 'design', 'organizational culture', 'organizational culture', 'artifacts', 'management']",design designing management experiences
"The present study represents a reinquiry and extension of Rindfleisch, Burroughs, and Denton's (1997) foundational study concerning the impact of family structure on materialism and compulsive buying in young adults. In addition to reexamining the relationships specified in the Rindfleisch et al. study, the authors of this study also examine additional and/or different relationships. The findings of their reinquiry include the following: (1)family structure is positively related to the happiness dimension of materialism; (2) the predicted direct effect of family structure on compulsive buying was not supported, suggesting that divorce m ay not affect compulsive buying until early adulthood; and (3) the mediating roles of family stressors and family resources, and the moderating role of socioeconomic status may require additional investigation.

"This study examines the performance implications of the alliance networks of 49 firms that competed for two technology standards in the U.S. local area network industry from 1989 to 1996. During the race to define a dominant design, individual firms attract the suppliers of complements by building alliance networks to favor the firms' preferred technology standard. Controlling,for the number of suppliers in each technology standard community and the extent Of technical progress achieved by individual firms, the panel data analysis shows that central firms with high ego network density, coupled with a strategic intent to acquire and share knowledge broadly within the technological community, achieve better innovation performance. The size of the technological community and some random events in the early formation of the industry do not provide a sufficient explanation of how these firms gain the diverse support of suppliers or enhance their competitive advantage. By demonstrating the independent and contingent effects of alliance network properties, this study explains how network patterns might enhance or limit the fits of alliance networks when focal firms embrace different innovation strategies.

"Although prior research underscores the benefits of external collaboration for a firm's innovative output, little research has examined the role that collaboration plays across the different stages of the innovation process. Drawing from organizational learning theory, this article examines (1) how collaboration with domestic partners assists in the formation of collaborations with foreign partners, (2) how knowledge from these collaborations is associated with product innovation at different levels of novelty, and (3) how the relationship between the level of innovation novelty and firm growth is influenced by whether the focal firm engages in open or closed innovation and the origin of the collaborator (foreign or domestic). Three key findings emerge from the econometric analysis of a sample of 1684 Taiwanese firms. First, domestic collaborations assist in the formation of foreign collaborations when the partner type is the same. Second, the level of innovation novelty is associated with the type and geographic location of partners. This study differentiates among noninnovating firms, incremental innovators, and radical innovators and demonstrates that the role of partners changes as the number of countries in which a firm collaborates with each partner type increases. Third, only radical innovation is relevant to firm growth, regardless of whether it is developed internally or through collaboration with domestic or foreign partners.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'MANUFACTURING FIRMS', 'VALUE CHAIN', 'DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION', 'RADICAL INNOVATION', 'PANEL-DATA', 'SUPPLIER INVOLVEMENT', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'BUSINESS SERVICES']","['radical innovation', 'radical innovation']",knowledge
"The interpersonal network structure of an organization directly influences the diffusion and recombination of ideas and can thus facilitate or impede organizational learning. Most interpersonal networks have 'hubs'-individuals who have significantly more connections than does the average member. This raises important questions about how hubs influence organizational learning outcomes. Does the presence of hubs improve or impair performance? What happens if hubs forget or misrepresent information that is transmitted through the network? Using simulation models, we find that moderately hubby networks outperform both very hubby and democratic networks. We also find that moderate amounts of information omission or misrepresentation can be surprisingly beneficial to performance, though the patterns of their effects are strikingly different.

"This paper outlines the development of research in the domain of service(s) marketing from its birth as an area of academic study in the 1960s/1970s to the current time. It identifies four phases of development. Phases 1-3 relate to the period before 2004, which focuses on the development of service(s) marketing. In Phase 4, a greater focus on the concept of service (singular) - defined as the application of knowledge and skills - has resulted in developments and directions in service research that offer a different perspective through which to view more general marketing. This different perspective has explicit implications also for wider business and management research. The paper summarizes current research in this domain, which coalesces around three broad perspectives, namely, the service-dominant logic of marketing, technology and service, and transformative service research. It concludes by outlining likely trends for service research into the future. Three interrelated directions are suggested: research on service in a changing context; research responding to academic schools of thought; and research responding to consumer trends.","['nanTECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL', 'MULTIPLE-ITEM SCALE', 'VALUE CO-CREATION', 'QUALITY-OF-LIFE', 'DOMINANT LOGIC', 'OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'VALUE PROPOSITIONS', 'CONCEPTUAL-MODEL', 'CONSUMER']","['dominant logic', 'dominant logic', 'consumer']",dominant logic context
"The study examines how team diversity affects external evaluation of the teams' business ideas. Using an information perspective, we argue that task-related diversity of member characteristics enhance team effectiveness. Nontask diversity hurt team effectiveness by steering teams away from their tasks. Some support was found. Task-related diversity of education level was positively related with evaluation while nontask diversities of age and employment status negatively related with evaluation. The positive relationship of task diversity on evaluations was higher for larger teams. The findings were robust across different functional forms for the demographic factors. Implications of team affects on venture outcomes are discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

"This study builds on insights from both upper echelons and agency perspectives to examine the effects on corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices of CEO's narcissism. Drawing on prior theory about CEO narcissism, we argue that CSR can be a response to leaders' personal needs for attention and image reinforcement and hypothesize that CEO narcissism has positive effects on levels and profile of organizational CSR; additionally, CEO narcissism will reduce the effect of CSR on performance. We find support for our ideas with a sample of Fortune 500 CEOs, operationalizing CEO narcissism with a novel media-based measurement technique that uses third-party ratings of CEO characteristics with validated psychometric scales.

"For banks operating in the fiercely competitive derivatives market the difference between the leaders and the also-rans often boils down to their respective approaches to product innovation. To achieve market leadership in this highly volatile field, a bank must develop and continually refine the processes and the expertise necessary for identifying new areas of business and attracting and retaining customers. Although the development of derivatives is a complex, expensive process, such development efforts provide the means for satisfying existing clients as well as attracting new customers. F. Axel Johne and M. Panos Pavlidis examine the managerial practices of banks that are acknowledged leaders in bringing new derivatives to market ahead of their competitors. In particular they examine how those first-mover banks apply their marketing expertise and they review the advantages those bank enjoy as a result of their success in product innovation. The banks studied fall into one of two groups: highly active innovators and less active innovators. The study reveals several significant differences between the two groups with respect to managing marketing inputs for product innovation purposes. First, compared to less active banks, the highly active innovators take a more sophisticated, market-based approach to identifying innovation opportunities. Rather than looking for innovations that offer a close fit with existing products and competencies, they analyze the benefits sought by target clients and initiate innovation efforts based on those analyses. Highly active innovators recognize the important role that internal marketing plays in encouraging functional specialists to work together for the purpose of identifying follow-on development opportunities. Internal marketing also helps to ensure that all parties understand and can support the planned innovation. The highly active innovators in this study do not take a formulaic approach to the development of new derivatives; instead, they rely on marketing expertise to identify and capitalize on business opportunities. Rather than concentrate solely on improving the core technical features of a product, the highly active innovators also recognize the importance of product augmentation innovation (to ensure the appropriate support for various market segments), process innovation (so they can reduce prices, when necessary), and market innovation (to ensure that they pursue the optimal mix of markets).","['nanPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'SUCCESS', 'FAILURE']",['success'],product innovation
"Scholars typically view offshore outsourcing as a means of reducing the cost of manufacturing activities for large corporations, yet offshore outsourcing may entail administrative and technical services, and may include activities outsourced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Drawing on research in international entrepreneurship and services, we hypothesize and find evidence that offshore outsourcing of administrative and technical services by SMEs is associated with greater extent and scope of internationalization of sales. Offshore outsourcing enhances international competitiveness by enabling SMEs to reduce costs, expand relational ties, serve customers more effectively, free up scarce resources, and leverage capabilities of foreign partners.

"This study underlines the limitations of commonly used proxies to measure value creation in interfirm alliances and addresses these limitations in two ways. First, this study adopts a co-opetition-based approach in theoretically conceptualizing value creation in interfirm alliances as a three-dimensional construct and argues that in addition to common benefit and private benefit (cooperation) (generally known as private benefits), a third dimension, namely private benefit (competition) should also be considered as an integral dimension of value creation. Second, by analyzing data collected from 155 firms of five high-technology research-intensive sectors in India that engaged in 288 alliances characterized by varying degree of co-opetition, this study empirically validates the distinctiveness of these three dimensions and presents a 17-item multidimensional scale of value creation.","['co-opetition', 'value creation', 'scale development', 'survey-based researchSTRATEGIC TECHNOLOGY ALLIANCES', 'STOCK-MARKET REACTIONS', 'SCALE DEVELOPMENT', 'FIRM CAPABILITIES', 'VALUE CAPTURE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'IMPACT', 'COOPERATION', 'COMPETITION', 'INNOVATION']","['co opetition', 'co opetition', 'value creation', 'value creation', 'cooperation', 'competition']",co private benefits
"Two experiments examined the factors that influence and the psychological processes that underlie country-of-origin evaluations. Subjects received attribute information that was either condensed in a single product or dispersed across several products manufactured in a country with relatively unfavorable associations. When consumers use country of origin as a basis for judgment under low motivation, or when the processing goal is to evaluate the country of origin, they focus on the country-of-origin information. Under such conditions, relevant evidence about the country of origin provided by dispersed information is likely to affect country-of-origin evaluations. In contrast, if consumers do not focus on the country of origin, such as under high motivation, or if their processing goal directs their attention away from country-of-origin information, any evidence about the country of origin is less likely to be utilized in their judgments. Findings from two experiments are consistent with this theorizing and highlight the central role of motivational intensity and direction in moderating the effect of information type on country-of-origin evaluations.","['nanPRODUCT EVALUATION', 'INFORMATION', 'PERSUASION', 'MOTIVATION', 'STEREOTYPE', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'STRENGTH', 'IMPACT']","['information', 'motivation']",country of consumers

"Purpose - Hyperconnectivity and supercooperation among partners within the mobile value chain are crucial factors for sustainable growth of the mobile ecosystem. This study aims to identify the complex structure of hyperconnectivity and supercooperation underlying revenue sharing practices and the actions and reactions of Chinese mobile video triads. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses the causal loop diagram and system dynamics simulation to demonstrate the feedback causal structure wherein the revenue sharing (RS) rule adjustments trigger interactions among participants (e.g., MNOs, SPs and CPs) in mobile video service triads, leading to fluctuations in the number of mobile video users and total revenue in the mobile video value chain. Findings - Change of RS rules among value chain participants is an incentive for achieving the sustainability of the mobile ecosystem, as examined using a system dynamics (SD) simulation. However, from the perspective of a tri-partite mobile value chain, the accidental adversary system archetype caused by adjustment of RS rules has an unintended negative impact on counterparts in the mobile ecosystem value chain. Originality/value - This study analyzes a complex feedback causal structure based on structural interdependencies among growth, limiting and relaxing loops in the Chinese mobile video ecosystem. The result of SD simulation suggests strategic alternatives such as the growth and underinvestment systems archetype to overcome limits to growth. Moreover, this study explores the accidental adversary archetype in complex and complicated mobile service triads as an impediment to achieving sustainability of the mobile ecosystem.","['Systems analysis', 'Value chain', 'SCM practices', 'Closed loop supply chains', 'Revenue sharing', 'Hyperconnectivity', 'Accidental adversary', 'Chinese mobile video value chainSUPPLY CHAIN', 'WHOLESALE-PRICE', 'COORDINATION', 'DYNAMICS', 'COMPETITION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'CONTRACTS', 'PRODUCTS', 'STRATEGY', 'INDUSTRY']","['value chain', 'value chain', 'revenue sharing', 'revenue sharing', 'hyperconnectivity', 'accidental adversary', 'accidental adversary', 'dynamics']",hyperconnectivity mobile value chain revenue sharing mobile video triads system dynamics simulation sustainability
"Relatively little attention has been paid to boards in international joint ventures (IJVs), and the composition of these boards in particular. We examine the determinants of foreign partners' representation on IJV boards in order to advance our knowledge of this facet of IJV governance. We argue that a foreign partner's representation on the IJV board is related to its equity contribution. However, we hypothesize that this relationship is moderated by IJV and host country characteristics that affect the importance of the internal and external roles IJV boards serve. These results provide insights into the conditions under which a partner might wish to secure greater board representation for its level of equity, or utilize less board representation than might be suggested by its equity level alone. Managerial summary: The functioning and composition of corporate boards have long been seen as critical to managers and shareholders alike. In contrast, the boards of IJVs have been relatively neglected. We advance our knowledge of this important facet of IJV governance. Specifically, we highlight the importance of two roles (i.e., an internal and external role) that IJV boards and directors fulfill. We find that the importance of these internal and external roles of boards determines whether a foreign partner might wish to secure greater board representation for its level of equity, or utilize less board representation than might be suggested by its equity level alone. Our results provide novel insights that can help managers structure their IJV boards.

"Once hailed as the salvation of U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, concurrent engineering (CE) offers the potential for faster development of higher quality, more producible products. Unlike traditional, serial approaches to new product development (NPD), CE emphasizes cross-functional integration and concurrent development of a product and its associated processes. As Morgan L. Swink, J. Christopher Sandvig, and Vincent A. Mabert explain, however, CE is not a plug-and-play process. Successful CE implementation approaches differ depending on such factors as product characteristics, customer needs, and technology requirements. We can better understand those differences by examining CE implementation in the five NPD programs discussed here: the Boeing 777 aircraft, the heavy duty diesel engine at Cummins Engine Co., the thermoplastic olefin automotive coating at Red Spot Paint and Varnish Co., the airborne vehicle forward-looking infrared night vision system at Texas Instruments, and the digital satellite system at Thomson Consumer Electronics. Teams provide the primary integration mechanism in CE programs, and three types of teams appeared frequently in these projects: a program management team, a technical team, and numerous design-build teams. Depending on the project's complexity, an integration team may be needed to consolidate the efforts of various design-build teams. Task forces also may be formed to address specific problems, such as investigating an emerging technology. Some projects emphasized collocation and face-to-face communication. Others relied on phone conversations, documents, and electronic mail. Projects focusing on design quality relied on formal presentations and periodic review meetings. projects emphasizing development speed required frequent, informal communications. Programs addressing design quality required extended product definition and performance testing, with input from design engineering, marketing, and customers. Efforts to reduce development time involved small, informal teams led by design engineers and managers. Aggressive product cost goals necessitated intensive interaction between product designers and manufacturing personnel. Highly innovative products required early supplier involvement and joint engineering problem solving. Formal design reviews and shaved design data systems aided information shaving between internal and external design groups.","['nanPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'MODEL', 'TIME']",['time'],integration teams
"At the start of a venture, most entrepreneurs wear many hats. However, entrepreneurs often cannot remain involved in every aspect of the venture process, and so they face important decisions about which roles to give up, which roles to retain, and which new roles to adopt. For many, this process is particularly difficult as roles represent more than just something entrepreneurs do but also an important part of who they are (role identities). Through an inductive field study, this research reveals how and why entrepreneurs add, subtract, or retain roles. We find three mechanisms perceiving the entrepreneur as someone who 'gives up the hats,' discovering new meaning (new role identities) within the venture, and role identity imprinting lead to a narrowing of one's role set, which ultimately influences venture growth.","['Qualitative research', 'Roles', 'Imprinting', 'Identity', 'Venture growthIDENTITY', 'IMPACT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CENTRALITY', 'EVOLUTION', 'FOUNDERS', 'PASSION', 'IMAGE', 'GO']","['roles', 'imprinting', 'identity']",entrepreneurs role identities identity imprinting
"Open innovation has attracted a significant amount of attention from scholars and practitioners. Prior research on open innovation has mainly focused on collaborative inventing. However, understanding the processes and outcomes of joint inventing is not sufficient for understanding sustained open-innovation activities and the competitive advantages of the actors involved in open innovation. Instead, an understanding of value creation and value capture is paramount for advancing our understanding of sustained open-innovation activities. Open innovation requires collaboration among distributed but interdependent actors who rely on each other's capabilities for value creation and capture. Value in open innovation is driven not only by actors' value creation but also by their ability to capture value. While value creation and value capture are discussed in the open-innovation literature, the advancement of this stream of research is hindered by conceptual ambiguity, especially in relation to the concept of value capture. This article adopts a value perspective on open innovation, offers consistent conceptualizations of value creation and value capture, and outlines potential avenues for further research at the interface of open innovation, value creation, and value capture.","['nanDYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'VALUE APPROPRIATION', 'BUSINESS MARKETS', 'COLLABORATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'INTEGRATION', 'INSIGHTS', 'INDUSTRY', 'TRUST']","['collaboration', 'perspective']",inventing collaboration capabilities
"Budget-related decisions in sponsored search auctions are recognized as a structured decision problem rather than a simple constraint. Budget planning over several coupled campaigns (e.g., substitution and complementarity) remains a challenging but important task for advertisers. In this paper, we propose a dynamic multicampaign budget planning approach using optimal control techniques, with consideration of the substitution relationship between advertising campaigns. A three-dimensional measure of substitution relationships between campaigns is presented, namely, the overlapping degree in terms of campaign contents, promotional periods, and target regions. We also study some desirable properties and possible solutions to our budget model. Computational simulations and experiments are conducted to evaluate our model using real-world data from practical campaigns in sponsored search auctions. Experimental results show that (1) our approach outperforms the baseline strategy that is commonly used in practice; (2) coupled campaigns with a higher overlapping degree in between reduce the optimal total budget level, then reduce the optimal payoff, and reach the budgeting cap earlier than those with a less overlapping degree; and (3) the advertising effort can be seriously weakened by ignoring the degree of overlapping between campaigns.","['Advertising campaigns', 'budget planning decision analysis', 'online advertising', 'operations research in marketing', 'optimal control', 'sponsored search', 'sponsored search auctionsOPTIMIZATION', 'MODELS', 'ADVERTISEMENTS', 'ALLOCATION']","['advertising campaigns', 'advertising campaigns', 'optimal control', 'optimal control', 'sponsored search', 'sponsored search']",auctions substitution complementarity model
"Pre-development activities, such as new product idea screening, are considered to play an important role in innovation success. At the screening stage, a management team evaluates new product and service ideas and makes a first go/no-go decision under high levels of uncertainty and ambiguity. Paying more attention to the decision-making process in the screening stage appears important because too rigorous a use of rigid evaluation criteria and inflexible methods have been shown to have an adverse effect on market performance of novel products. The present study proposes and tests a model of team-level antecedents and consequences of reflexivity-the explicit evaluation and discussion of working methods, tools, and criteria within a team. Recently, researchers have proposed that cognitive style and leadership style are major antecedents of decision-making performance. This study posits that reflexivity offers an explanation of how transformational leadership and cognitive style can eventually affect decision-making performance in the context of new product idea screening. Results of a survey among 126 top managers from large international firms show that the positive effects of transformational leadership and procedural rationality on the effectiveness and efficiency of screening decision making are largely mediated by reflexivity at the team level. This suggests that screening teams can improve their decision making in the following ways: committee chairs are advised to stimulate openness, develop a stop-and-think attitude among screening committee members, and support argument-based discussion in order to adapt available decision tools, models, and checklists whenever needed. The paper concludes with implications, limitations of the study, and suggestions for further research.","['nanFUZZY FRONT-END', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'OUTCOME INTERDEPENDENCE', 'TEAM EFFECTIVENESS', '5-FACTOR MODEL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PROJECT', 'INNOVATIONS', 'PERSONALITY', 'INDUSTRIAL']","['transformational leadership', 'transformational leadership', 'performance']",model
"Despite the growing need, nonprofit organization marketers have not yet fully delineated the most effective ways to position charitable appeals. Across five experiments, the authors test the prediction that other-benefit (self-benefit) appeals generate more favorable donation support than self-benefit (other-benefit) appeals in situations that heighten (versus minimize) public self-image concerns. Public accountability, a manipulation of public self-awareness, and individual differences in public self-consciousness all moderate the effect of appeal type on donor support. In particular, self-benefit appeals are more effective when consumers' responses are private in nature; in contrast, other-benefit appeals are more effective when consumers are publicly accountable for their responses. This effect is moderated by norm salience and is related to a desire to manage impressions by behaving in a manner consistent with normative expectations. The results have important managerial implications, suggesting that rather than simply relying on one type of marketing appeal across situations, marketers should tailor their marketing message to the situation or differentially activate public self-image concerns to match the appeal type.","['charity', 'self-benefit', 'other-benefit', 'altruism', 'egoism', 'public self-image', 'normsPERSPECTIVE', 'RESPONSES', 'EXCHANGE', 'CONSCIOUSNESS', 'AWARENESS', 'IDENTITY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'PRIVATE', 'NORMS', 'FOCUS']","['self benefit', 'self benefit', 'other benefit', 'other benefit', 'public self image', 'public self image', 'public self image', 'responses', 'consciousness', 'awareness', 'private']",benefit self image accountability awareness

"Consumer regret can result in unfavorable outcomes for marketers. To prevent regret, many retailers promise to refund money to consumers who discover lower prices after purchase. The authors show that a refund's effect on felt regret depends on how consumers view these promises. If consumers mainly view them as protective tools (i.e., adopt a protection focus), postrefund regret is minimal. If consumers primarily view such promises as sources of information about the retailer's price status (i.e., adopt an information focus), regret persists even after refund. The authors show that regret persists with these consumers because finding a lower price results in a perception of trust violation. They find that subject to boundary conditions, using a disclaimer that states that the retailer does not claim to offer the lowest prices helps avoid this negative outcome for information-focused consumers. The authors contribute to the literature on outcome reversibility and regret by showing that outcome reversal does not necessarily obviate regret. In addition, they show that regulatory focus serves as the motivational basis for how consumers view refund promises.","['regret', 'signal focus', 'regulatory focus', 'low-price guarantees', 'trust violation', 'message framingSELF-REGULATORY GOALS', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'FOCUS', 'GUARANTEES', 'PREVENTION', 'PROMOTION', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'TRUST', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PERSUASION']","['regret', 'regulatory focus', 'regulatory focus', 'trust violation', 'trust violation', 'focus', 'trust']",consumer regret felt regret protection trust outcome reversibility promises
"This paper aims to predict consumer acceptance of e-commerce by proposing a set of key drivers for engaging consumers in on-line transactions. The primary constructs for capturing consumer acceptance of e-commerce are intention to transact and on-line transaction behavior. Following the theory of reasoned action (TRA) as applied to a technology-driven environment, technology acceptance model (TAM) variables (perceived usefulness and ease of use) are posited as key drivers of e-commerce acceptance. The practical utility of TAM stems from the fact that e-commerce is technology-driven. The proposed model integrates trust and perceived risk, which are incorporated given the implicit uncertainty of the e-commerce environment. The proposed integration of the hypothesized independent variables is justified by placing all the variables under the nomological TRA structure and proposing their interrelationships. The resulting research model is tested using data from two empirical studies. The first, exploratory study comprises three experiential scenarios with 103 students. The second, confirmatory study uses a sample of 155 on-line consumers. Both studies strongly support the e-commerce acceptance model by validating the proposed hypotheses. The paper discusses the implications for e-commerce theory, research, and practice, and makes several suggestions for future research.","['consumer behavior', 'perceived ease of use', 'perceived risk', 'perceived usefulness', 'technology acceptance', 'transaction intentions', 'trustUSER ACCEPTANCE', 'TRUSTWORTHINESS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PRICE']","['perceived risk', 'perceived risk', 'perceived usefulness', 'perceived usefulness', 'technology acceptance', 'technology acceptance']",theory of reasoned action trust perceived risk uncertainty
"Purpose - The purpose of this technical viewpoint is to provide a commentary of how we went about using logistics prototyping as a method to engage citizens, science fiction (SF) writers and small-to medium-sized enterprises (SME's). Six urban logistic prototypes built on the themes of future cities, community resilience and urban supply chain management (SCM) are summarized, together with details of the data collection procedure and the methodological challenges encountered. Our investigation aimed to explore the potential of logistics prototyping to develop user-driven and SME approaches to future city design and urban supply chain decision-making. Design/methodology/approach - This Boston field experiment was a case study investigation conducted between May and August 2013. Qualitative data was collected using a mixed-method approach combining together focus groups (MIT faculty), scenarios, prototyping workshops, interviews and document analysis. These story-creators could use the prototype method as a way of testing their hypotheses, theories and constrained speculations with regard to specified future city and urban supply chain scenarios. Findings - This viewpoint suggests that the prototyping method allows for unique individual perspectives on future city planning and urban supply chain design. This work also attempts to demonstrate that prototyping can create sufficiently cogent environments for future city and urban SCM theories to be both detected and analysed therein. Although this is an experimental field of the SCM theory building, more conventional theories could also be tested in the same manner. Research limitations/implications - By embedding logistics prototyping within a mixed method approach, we might be criticized as constraining its capability to map out the future - that its potential to be flexible and imaginative are held back by the equal weighting given to the more conventional component. In basing our case study within one city then this might be seen as limiting the complexity of the empirical context however, the situation within different cities is inherently complex. Case studies also attract criticism on the grounds of not being representative; in this situation, they might be criticized as imperfect indicators of what transpires in other situations. However, this technical viewpoint suggests that in spite of its limitations, prototyping facilitates an imaginative and creative approach to theory generation and concept building. Practical implications - The methodology allows everyday citizens and SME's to develop user-driven foresight and planning scenarios with city strategists' and urban logistic designers. It facilitates much broader stakeholder involvement in city and urban supply chain policymaking, than current quantitative approaches. Social implications - Logistics fiction prototyping provides a democratic approach to future city planning and urban supply chain design. It involves collectively imagining socio-technical futures and second-order sociological effects through the writing of SF narratives or building design fictions. Originality/value - Decision-making in future cities and urban SCM is often a notable challenge, balancing the varying needs and claims of multiple stakeholders, while negotiating an acceptable trade-off between their competing claims. Engagement with stakeholders and active encouragement of stakeholder participation in the supply chain aspects of future cities is increasingly a feature of twenty-first century social decision-making. This viewpoint suggests that the prototyping method allows for unique individual perspectives on future city planning and urban supply chain design. This work also attempts to demonstrate that prototyping can create sufficiently cogent environments for future city and the urban SCM theories to be both detected and analysed therein. Although this is an experimental field of SCM theory building, more conventional theories could also be tested in the same manner.","['Innovation', 'Sustainability', 'Logistics', 'Operations strategy', 'Green supply chains', 'Operations planningSCENARIOS', 'FORESIGHT']","['logistics', 'foresight']",logistics community resilience supply chain management
"This paper seeks to extend the literature on how change occurs in organizational routines by examining the link between routines and schemata and showing the cognitive and motivational factors involved. Using an in-depth analysis of a Japanese multinational, we develop an account of how a newly-implemented centralized performance management routine is interpreted by managers at two subsidiaries. We show how different performances of subroutines emerge into a new ostensive pattern of a routine, and how the cognitive and motivational aspects of individual agency are manifested in this process and how they affect the espoused organizational schema.","['cognition', 'motivation', 'performance management', 'routines', 'schemataORGANIZATIONAL ROUTINES', 'CAPABILITIES', 'COGNITION', 'CONTEXT', 'PERSPECTIVES', 'RETHINKING', 'APPRAISAL', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'WORKSHOP', 'IDENTITY']","['motivation', 'performance management', 'performance management', 'routines']",routines motivational performance
"This paper examines how knowledge created by firm experience (learning economies) and scale and scope economies affect performance in firms' development activities. The empirical results suggest that each factor has a significant effect on development performance. Moreover, knowledge that results from greater experience within a particular technological area, when combined with knowledge spillovers from greater scope in other technological areas, significantly improves development performance. The results suggest that experience shapes and facilitates firms' abilities to absorb knowledge spillovers. Our empirical findings thus provide a more nuanced examination of the drivers of performance and have implications for the management of firms' development activities.

"It is recognized in the literature that experience may affect the cost and the uncertainty of operating in foreign markets, and experience and market knowledge may therefore influence the location decisions of FDIs. Economic theory does not, however, predict a general expansion pattern of FDIs across industries. On the other hand, the theory associated with the internationalization process approach highlights the importance of cultural distance, and predicts a movement from close to more distant markets as more experience is acquired by the firm. The internationalization process approach is rooted in a behavioral theory of the firm. In this article two hypotheses are developed from the internationalization process approach regarding the locations of FDIs. The database used for testing the hypotheses includes in principle all FDIs undertaken by Norwegian manufacturing companies up to the midyear 1982. Cultural distance is measured by an index developed by Kogut and Singh [1988]. No support is found for the notion that the first FDI in general takes place in culturally closer countries than later FDIs. Furthermore, for given companies, an expansion into more distant countries is not found as the number of investments increases.","['nanINTERNATIONALIZATION', 'FIRM', 'COUNTRIES', 'MARKET']","['firm', 'countries', 'market']",cultural distance behavioral theory
"Under a worldwide tax system, firms pay taxes on their domestic income and repatriated foreign income, whereas under a territorial tax system repatriated foreign income is exempt from taxation. We examine whether worldwide tax systems reduce the incentives of multinational corporations to engage in tax management in their foreign subsidiaries. Using two quasi-natural experiments, we show that multinationals lower the effective tax rates in their foreign subsidiaries after countries switch from a worldwide to a territorial tax system. Thus, multinationals subject to a worldwide tax system face competitive disadvantages compared to competitors from countries with a territorial tax system.","['cross-border investments', 'foreign subsidiaries', 'dividend repatriation', 'tax avoidance', 'territorial tax system', 'worldwide tax systemDIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'CORPORATE', 'MULTINATIONALS', 'REPATRIATION', 'TERRITORIAL', 'INCENTIVES', 'AVOIDANCE', 'SHELTERS', 'HAVENS', 'HOME']","['foreign subsidiaries', 'foreign subsidiaries', 'territorial tax system', 'territorial tax system', 'territorial tax system', 'multinationals', 'territorial', 'incentives']",firms multinational corporations
"The domain and theories of marketing have been expanding since the origins of the discipline. Since the 1970s marketing science has been organized around the exchange paradigm. Marketing concepts apply to all forms of exchange, whether it is goods, services, personages, places or ideas, and whether it is between individuals, for-profit and nonprofit firms, governments and NGOs. Marketing theories evolved from a firm oriented view to encompass the exchanging dyad. More recently the paradigm expanded to a network level of explanation, and relational theories have come to the fore. But even as the field struggles to grasp its new fields of explanation, there is a Kuhnian shift happening at its boundaries. The shift significantly bends the marketing worldview as well as the theoretical tools and methodologies we use to study it. In this paper we develop a three-tiered explanation of the emerging field of marketing-its subphenomena (consumer experiences and sensory systems), its phenomena (marketing networks), and its superphenomena (sustainability and development).","['Marketing paradigm', 'Marketing future', 'Marketing theory', 'Consumption experience', 'Consumer sensory processes', 'Consumer neurophysiology', 'Nanotechnology', 'Marketing networks', 'Consumer networks', 'Sustainable marketing', 'Marketing and poverty alleviationCONSUMER', 'CONSUMPTION', 'ENVIRONMENT']","['marketing networks', 'marketing networks']",exchange networks sustainability
"Prior research indicates that a stimulus can reinforce an action if the stimulus is a reward (i.e., a priori positive) or carries useful information. The current research finds that if a stimulus is perceived as a reaction to an action, it can reinforce the action even if the stimulus is a priori nonpositive and noninformative. Mere reactions are reinforcing. Specifically, eight experiments, including a field experiment, demonstrate that individuals are more likely to repeat an action (e.g., insertingmoney in a donation box or typing a message in a textbox) if the action is followed by a stimulus (e.g., the emission of a sound or the flash of an image) than if it is not, even if the stimulus is a priori negative (e.g., an annoying sound or an aversive image) and carries no useful information. Moreover, the effect just described will occur only if the stimulus is contingent on (immediately follows) the action and perceived as a reaction to the action. Finally, by serving as a reaction, an a priori nonpositive stimulus can become positive. The present work yields theoretical implications for stimulus-response relationships and practical implications for designs of consumer products and loyalty programs.","['reaction', 'motivation', 'reinforcement', 'valence', 'contingency', 'control', 'heuristic', 'overgeneralization', 'product designELECTRIC-SHOCK', 'MOTIVATION', 'FEEDBACK', 'PAY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'IMPACT', 'CURIOSITY', 'STIMULUS']","['reaction', 'stimulus']",mere stimulus response
"In the retailing sector, consumers typically patronize multiple outlets, which confronts these outlets with an important issue: determining how to gain a greater part of consumer expenditures. One potential avenue is to increase consumer lifetime duration and repeat purchases through loyalty cards. This research, using BehaviorScan single-source panel data, examines the impact of loyalty programs on customer lifetime duration in grocery stores. The findings suggest that loyalty schemes have positive effects on customer lifetimes and share of consumer expenditures. However, multiple loyalty card memberships of geographically close retailers reduce lifetime duration. Furthermore, the higher the share of consumer expenditures in a store, the longer the lifetime duration will be. (C) 2007 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"This article describes the development and testing of a forecasting system for retailers who plan periodic promotions. When the number of variables describing the promotion is large relative to the historical database of past promotions, traditional forecasting approaches cannot be applied. In such cases, retailers must rely on the expertise of their buyers to subjectively estimate promotional unit sales. This research develops a Case-Based Reasoning system that allows all buyers to forecast promotional sales as accurately as the organization's expert buyer and, by making the subjective process explicit, also provides an avenue to improve forecast performance over time. The system (1) selects the historical analogs that are most similar to the planned promotion, (2) adjusts the sales of each analog to account for any differences between the analog and the planned promotion, and (3) combines the forecasts derived from the multiple analogs to arrive at a single sales projection. The performance of the system was tested and found to compare favorably to the performance of an expert buyer in a large national retail organization.","['ANALOG', 'FORECASTING', 'COMBINING FORECASTS', 'RETAIL INDUSTRY', 'PROMOTION PLANNING', 'CASE-BASED REASONING', 'ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEMODELS']","['analog', 'forecasting', 'case based reasoning', 'case based reasoning', 'case based reasoning']",forecasting system sales
"Long-term orientation (LTO) is a salient aspect of national culture values and as such influences consumers' decision-making processes. This article describes the development and validation of measures to assess LTO. Scale development procedures resulted in a two-factor, eight-item scale that reflects the tradition and planning aspects of LTO. A program of studies involving more than 2,000 respondents in four countries demonstrated the psychometric properties of the measures, their discriminant and convergent validities, and the relationship of the measures to other important theoretical concepts (e.g., consumer frugality, compulsive buying, and ethical values). The measures are applicable for investigating individual differences in LTO both within and across cultures.","['measurement', 'culture', 'long-term orientationUNITED-STATES', 'VALIDITY', 'SCREENER', 'CULTURE', 'ISSUES', 'TIME', 'US']","['culture', 'culture']",frugality
"Building on an inductive, qualitative study of independent workers-people not affiliated with an organization or established profession-this paper develops a theory about the management of precarious and personalized work identities. We find that in the absence of organizational or professional membership, workers experience stark emotional tensions encompassing both the anxiety and fulfillment of working in precarious and personal conditions. Lacking the holding environment provided by an organization, the workers we studied endeavored to create one for themselves through cultivating connections to routines, places, people, and a broader purpose. These personal holding environments helped them manage the broad range of emotions stirred up by their precarious working lives and focus on producing work that let them define, express, and develop their selves. Thus holding environments transformed workers' precariousness into a tolerable and even generative predicament. By clarifying the process through which people manage emotions associated with precarious and personalized work identities, and thereby render their work identities viable and their selves vital, this paper advances theorizing on the emotional underpinnings of identity work and the systems psychodynamics of independent work.","['work identity', 'emotion management', 'holding environments', 'gig economy', 'independent workers', 'systems psychodynamics', 'individual agencyPSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY', 'SELF', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'EMOTION', 'IMAGE', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'EXPERIENCES']","['holding environments', 'holding environments', 'independent workers', 'independent workers', 'systems psychodynamics', 'systems psychodynamics', 'emotion']",identity
"In this study, we develop a multi-level theoretical framework linking antecedents and outcomes of peer control, defined as team members at the same hierarchical level noticing and responding to their peers' behaviour or performance. Analysing multi-level data from 356 volunteers and 58 regional teams in a non-profit organization, we examine top-down managerial controls as antecedents of lateral peer control, both directly (i.e., monitoring and responding directly to peers) and indirectly (i.e., gossiping about and avoiding underperforming peers), and peer control's effects on individual- and team-level outcomes. In line with our predictions, we find formal managerial control and clan control to be antecedents of peer control, albeit with differential effects on direct and indirect peer control. We also find a significant association between peer control and both individual-level job satisfaction and team-level performance, but again, with crucial differences between the two types of peer controls and the two outcomes. Our study contributes to the development of a better theoretical understanding of peer control, sheds light on inconsistent findings across prior studies, provides novel insights into how team leaders can influence team members' individual satisfaction and team-level performance via peer control, and reveals important trade-offs with regards to peer control's influence on individual- and team-level outcomes.","['formal and informal (clan) control', 'job satisfaction', 'multi-level analysis', 'non-profit organizations', 'organizational control', 'peer control', 'team performance', 'volunteersORGANIZATIONAL CONTROL', 'CONCERTIVE CONTROL', 'WORK', 'MANAGEMENT', 'CONTEXT', 'GOSSIP', 'WORKPLACE', 'OUTCOMES', 'SIZE']","['job satisfaction', 'job satisfaction', 'peer control', 'peer control', 'work', 'gossip', 'outcomes']",peer control job satisfaction
"For companies to realize the benefits of recent innovations in customer interface technology, they need to understand the value consumers place on technology as part of the shopping process. A national survey of 2,120 online consumers was conducted to explore how people want to shop in both online and in-store environments and determine how interactive and conventional media work together to move consumers through the purchase process. The study investigated 128 different aspects of the shopping experience, from common elements to recent innovations. The results indicated that consumers are generally satisfied with the convenience, quality, selection, and value provided by retailers today. They are less satisfied with the level of service provided, the availability of product information, and the speed of the shopping process. The findings suggest that new technologies can enhance the shopping experience, but applications must be tailored to the unique requirements of consumer segments and product categories.","['nanSATISFACTION', 'ACCEPTANCE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'ONLINE', 'MODEL']",['online'],technology online
"Primitive emotional contagion has been proposed to explain why service with a smile predicts encounter satisfaction. We provide a comprehensive test of this mechanism by examining mimicry and mood as mediators in service encounters, contrasting such mediation with a direct path through perceived service quality. Independent coders recorded the strength of employees' and customers' smiles at three points in time during real service encounters, and 173 customers completed postencounter surveys. Mimicry effects were supported; however, only service quality appraisals, and not customers' affect, fully mediated the relationship of employee smiling and encounter satisfaction.","['nanFACIAL EXPRESSIONS', 'MOOD', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERSONALITY', 'EXPERIENCE', 'DUCHENNE', 'QUALITY', 'DISPLAY', 'EVENTS', 'MODEL']","['mood', 'quality']",mood encounters service quality
"We draw on institutional isomorphism literature to develop a conceptual framework which uncovers how emerging market MNEs manage institutional tensions and complexity in corporate governance (CG) regulations within and across economic environments. Using a sample of 400 firm-year observations (2011-2015) from Nigeria, we show foreign directorship and cross-listing as significant avenues for governance isomorphism. MNEs employ these mechanisms to manage and reconcile foreign and Nigerian CG regulations whilst overcoming institutional weaknesses at home. Specifically, governance isomorphism leads to improvement of home country CG disclosures practices because of associated linkages with international CG systems through cross-listing and employment of multinational directors.","['Governance isomorphism', 'Institutional isomorphism', 'Nigeria', 'Cross listing (bonding)', 'Multinational directorship', 'Corporate governance disclosure', 'National governance', 'Emerging marketsCORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'INSTITUTIONAL DISTANCE', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'UNITED-STATES', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'BOARD COMPOSITION', 'CAPITAL-MARKETS', 'PANEL-DATA', 'INFORMATION', 'OWNERSHIP']","['governance isomorphism', 'governance isomorphism', 'institutional isomorphism', 'institutional isomorphism', 'nigeria']",institutional isomorphism emerging market corporate governance foreign directorship cross listing disclosures employment
"This paper examines how channel interactions influence product bundling decisions by channel members. Specifically, what products or bundles should be offered, at what prices, and by which channel members, in equilibrium. To answer this, we analyze Stackelberg games between a manufacturer and retailer, with pricing and bundling as decision variables, under discrete and uniform continuous distributions of reservation prices. We find that selling pure components by both manufacturer and retailer is the equilibrium except in a narrow region of the parameter space. However, if the manufacturer can sell bundles and prevent unbundling, then such a bundling strategy is optimal in many cases. Interestingly, the channel and retailer also benefit from this strategy.

"This study provides a comprehensive analysis of distribution channel choices of new entrepreneurial ventures (NEVs). First, factors that influence NEVs' choice of distribution channels are examined. Second, performance consequences of those choices are investigated. A research model drawing from transaction cost economics as well as customer relationship and strategy literature is developed. Data collected from 330 NEVs are used to test the proposed model. The results show that the identified antecedents explain a large part of the variance in NEVs' channel choice. Moreover, NEVs that accomplish a fit between their distribution channel system and transaction cost-, product-, strategy-, and competition-related variables tend to perform better. Findings are discussed in light of the specific characteristics of NEVs.","['nanTRANSACTION COST ECONOMICS', 'ENTRY MODE CHOICE', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'SALES FORCE', 'STRATEGY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'BUY', 'INTEGRATION', 'CONFIGURATIONS', 'DETERMINANTS']","['strategy', 'performance']",new entrepreneurial ventures model antecedents competition
"We build on multiple theoretical perspectives to investigate the unique and joint effects of individual- and opportunity-level factors affecting job creation in new firms. We tested hypotheses using survey data from individuals who transitioned from unemployment to self-employment under the auspices of a German public policy program. Our findings reveal that an entrepreneur's breadth of knowledge has a negative influence on the firm's job creation, whereas the entrepreur's leadership experience has a positive influence. However, as the sector-specific labor requirements of a business opportunity increase, both breadth of knowledge and leadership experience allow founders to operate their firms with fewer employees.","['nanECONOMETRIC-MODELS', 'SELF-EMPLOYMENT', 'BIG 5', 'SURVIVAL', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ENTRY', 'DETERMINANTS', 'CAPABILITIES', 'PERSONALITY']","['self employment', 'self employment']",job creation unemployment
"As concerns about pollution and climate change become more mainstream, the belief that shopping with reusable grocery bags is an important environmental and socially conscious choice has gained prevalence. In parallel, firms have joined policy makers in using a variety of initiatives to reduce the use of disposable plastic bags. However, little is known about how these initiatives might alter other elements of consumers' in-store behavior. Using scanner panel data from a single California location of a major grocery chain, and controlling for consumer heterogeneity, the authors demonstrate that bringing one's own bags increases purchases of not only environmentally friendly organic foods but also indulgent foods. They use experimental methods to further explore the expression of these effects and to consider the effects of potential moderators, including competing goals and store policies. The findings have implications for decisions related to product pricing, placement and assortment, store layout, and the choice of strategies employed to increase the use of reusable bags.","['sustainability', 'licensing', 'priming', 'green marketing', 'mixed methodsCONSUMER PERCEPTIONS', 'PURCHASE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'PURSUIT', 'CHOICE', 'FOODS', 'US']","['purchase', 'behavior', 'choice', 'foods', 'us']",in store foods

"This research examines how consumers' subjective product knowledge affects the way they interpret salesperson compensation within the financial services industry. Data from a nationwide panel of consumers show that higher product knowledge consumers become highly suspicious and lower purchase intentions when salesperson commission rates fall outside of the latitude of acceptance (Study 1).

"This paper questions a key assumption in the organizations literature that the dynamism of institutional logics and practice variations is the result of rivalry among logics and actors, of tensions and institutional shifts, and of the agency of institutional entrepreneurs. This study examines in rich historical detail the development of accounting in the Jesuit Order, illustrating how Jesuit accounting started from a rationality that did not presuppose an external ordering principle; instead, Jesuit rationality was unfoldingfounded in continuous interrogations informed by common, purposeful procedural logics stemming from rhetorical practices used to classify, recall, and invent knowledge. I examine this concept of unfolding rationality in two areas of Jesuit practices: spiritual self-accountability and administrative accounting and recordkeeping. In this Jesuit rationality, the relationships between means and ends, and how and why behaviors take place, were not anchored permanently in a substantive logic. Instead, procedural logics left individual Jesuits and the community to imagine modes of action in the specific social and organizational contexts in which their missions operated. Jesuit rationality was thus unfolding, a persistent and recursive mode of governing social behavior and searching for organizational order that generated large-scale administrative routines and institutional dynamism while never fully achieving that order. The analysis brings into question our understanding of the historical and institutional genealogies of modern rationality and its taken-for-granted link with Protestant ethics.","['rationality', 'institutional logics', 'administration', 'accounting', 'Jesuits', 'rhetoricORGANIZATION', 'INFORMATION', 'COMPLEXITY', 'AMBIGUITY', 'PRAXIS', 'FIELD']","['rationality', 'institutional logics', 'institutional logics', 'accounting', 'jesuits']",organizations

"Branding and transaction cost economics represent two research streams that rarely cross paths in the literature. hi this study, I explore the transaction cost implication of private branding, a practice whereby products supplied by unaffiliated manufacturers are sold under private brands owned by retailers. The main thesis is that private branding can preempt a special case of asset specificity called brand specificity, where retailers also invest in the marketing of an outsourced product, but subsequent reputation effects (positive or negative) are specific to the manufacturer who brands the product. Retailers, thus, will not be fully motivated to optimize their investment in product marketing unless they take over the branding right. With potential barriers to private branding being controlled, data obtained from a national chain reveal that the retailer deploys its marketing resources according to the branding status of a product, implying that private branding can deflect the transaction cost of solving the brand specificity problem. The results offer new theoretical insights into branding and transaction cost analysis. This efficiency-based approach to private branding also provides practitioners with useful guidelines for crafting a branding strategy that will facilitate cooperation between manufacturers and retailers.

"Entrepreneurship theory has largely been developed and tested using symmetrical correlational methods, effectively describing the sample-average respondent and subsuming individual differences. Such methods necessarily limit investigation of asymmetries that are evident in entrepreneurship, and provide only a single explanation that belies the multiple pathways to entrepreneurship observed in practice. This paper employs a case-based approach-fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA)-to identify configurations of antecedent attributes of individuals in groups within samples, thereby revealing asymmetries and multiple entrepreneurial pathways that are otherwise hidden in the data. We explain the application of fsQCA to reveal these common issues in entrepreneurship; demonstrate how fsQCA complements correlational methods and offers finer-grained understanding of individual entrepreneurial behavior; and offer a comprehensive research agenda to build new entrepreneurship theory.","['Fuzzy set', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Asymmetric data', 'Outliers', 'ConfigurationsPOSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY', 'BUSINESS FAILURE', 'DATA-COLLECTION', 'INTENTIONS', 'COMPLEXITY', 'DECISIONS', 'SURVIVAL', 'PATHS', 'CONFIGURATIONS', 'CONSEQUENCES']","['fuzzy set', 'fuzzy set', 'entrepreneurship', 'configurations']",entrepreneurship theory pathways analysis fsqca configurations
"Despite the challenged contention that consumers serve more onto larger dinnerware, it remains unclear what would cause this and who might be most at risk. The results of five studies suggest that the neglected Delboeuf illusion may explain how the size of dinnerware creates two opposing biases that lead people to overserve on larger plates and bowls and underserve on smaller ones. A countercyclical sinus-shaped relationship is shown to exist between these serving biases and the relative gap between the edge of the food and the edge of the dinnerware. Although these serving biases are difficult to eliminate with attention and education, changing the color of one's dinnerware or tablecloth may help attenuate them. By showing that the Delboeuf illusion offers a mechanistic explanation for how dinnerware size can bias serving and intake, we open new theoretical opportunities for linking illusions to eating behavior and suggest how simple changes in design can improve consumer welfare.","['nanVISUAL ILLUSIONS', 'BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST', 'PORTION SIZES', 'ASSIMILATION', 'VOLUME', 'DIMENSIONS', 'PERCEPTION', 'JUDGMENTS', 'CONTOUR', 'SHAPE']",['shape'],
"Although the returns of customer participation on new product development (NPD) performance can vary substantially, the current literature lacks a systematic conceptual and empirical integration showing when customer participation is valuable in enhancing NPD performance. Building on knowledge management theory, the authors present a conceptual framework that synthesizes a variety of contingency factors. A meta-analysis empirically examines the moderating effects of contextual factors between customer participation and NPD performance. The analysis reveals that involving customers in the ideation and launch stages of NPD improves new product financial performance directly as well as indirectly through acceleration of time to market, whereas customer participation in the development phase slows down time to market, deteriorating new product financial performance. Furthermore, the benefits of customer participation on NPD performance are greater in technologically turbulent NPD projects, in emerging countries, in low-tech industries, for business customers, and for small firms. The authors discuss several theoretical and managerial implications about when to engage customers in the innovation process.","['customer participation', 'new product development', 'new product development performance', 'knowledge management', 'meta-analysisMARKET ORIENTATION', 'PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT', 'PUBLICATION BIAS', 'INNOVATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'USERS', 'INTEGRATION', 'SUCCESS', 'SERVICE']","['customer participation', 'customer participation', 'new product development', 'new product development', 'new product development', 'knowledge management', 'knowledge management', 'innovation', 'knowledge', 'integration']",customer participation new product development knowledge management meta analysis innovation
"Market based institutional reforms across the globe have led to massive improvements in business conditions and have contributed to unprecedented rates of cross-border business activities. Scholars have tried to understand the implications of such reforms and have amassed a significant body of work in this area, but analysis of this literature highlights some deficiencies limiting its impact. A primary issue is the fragmentation of this work across different disciplines and the use of different terminology even in the business literature, leading to disconnected conversations and limited progress on the topic. The purpose of this article is two-fold: (1) provide a systematic review of the literature on the effect of market based institutional reforms on firm strategy and performance, and (2) propose a future research agenda. We argue that employing an aggregate perspective, as opposed to one focusing on individual reform subcomponents, provides a more comprehensive understanding of their systemic implications. We use this approach to analyze extant work on the implications of reforms including both direct effects on firm strategy and performance and various contingences such as location, time, institutional legacies, and global organizations. To summarize our two objectives, we develop two graphical models - one depicting the current state of the literature and the other highlighting possible theoretical additions for future research.","['Market based institutional reforms', 'Firm performance', 'Firm strategy', 'Contingency effectsRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'ECONOMIC-REFORM', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'WASHINGTON CONSENSUS', 'MANUFACTURING FIRMS', 'GROUP AFFILIATION', 'CATCH-UP', 'LIBERALIZATION', 'TRANSITION', 'INDUSTRY']","['market based institutional reforms', 'market based institutional reforms', 'market based institutional reforms', 'market based institutional reforms', 'firm strategy', 'firm strategy']",market firm strategy global organizations

"We empirically investigate how sellers' website quality affects buyers' economic and social satisfaction, which in turn influences buyers' repurchase intentions in consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce contexts. In addition, we examine how the effects exerted by economic and social satisfaction on repurchase intentions are moderated by relational capital between buyers and sellers. Data collected from 311 buyers on the TaoBao website provide strong support for the proposed model. The results indicate that information quality exerts a stronger impact on economic satisfaction than does service quality. Service quality exerts a stronger impact on social satisfaction than does information quality. System quality has no effect on economic or social satisfaction. Economic satisfaction can contribute to buyers' repurchase intentions, but the impact of social satisfaction on repurchase intentions is insignificant.

"The compensation literature is replete with arguments, but lacking in empirical tests, regarding the effects of pay dispersion on organizational outcomes. Pay dispersion may increase effort and provide incentives for high workforce performance levels, but may also inhibit cooperation and goal orientation among employees. Drawing on several theoretical perspectives (individual motivation, institutional theory, organizational justice, and neoclassical economics), this study predicts that pay dispersion will be associated with higher levels of workforce performance when accompanied by formal individual incentive systems and independent work, while pay compression is desirable in the absence of individual incentive systems and when work is interdependent. Survey research studies in two industrial sectors (the motor carrier and concrete pipe industries) were conducted to address these issues. Interactive regression results were generally supportive of the predictions across several measures of workforce performance (accident rates, safety violations, and productivity). Implications of these studies for strategy implementation in terms of compensation theory and practice are addressed.

"Little is known about the interface between separate marketing units and sales units. This article develops a multidimensional model of the marketing and sales interface. The model integrates a broad range of conceptual domains, including information sharing, structural linkages, power, orientations, and knowledge of marketing and sales. The authors empirically explore the conceptual model through a cross-industry study of 337 European Union-based companies. They identify five empirical archetypes of the marketing and sales interface. The taxonomy shows that the role and characteristics of marketing and sales vary a great deal. This finding challenges existing stereotypes about marketing and sales. Finally, the article explores organizational outcomes of the five configurations. The findings suggest that the most successful configurations are characterized by strong structural linkages between marketing and sales and a high extent of market knowledge in marketing.","['marketing organization', 'sales organization', 'interface', 'taxonomy', 'configurationSTRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'BUSINESS STRATEGY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CONFIGURATIONS', 'INTRAORGANIZATIONAL POWER', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'CLUSTERING METHODS', 'EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL']","['interface', 'taxonomy', 'model']",power
"Consumers from cultures that read from left to right possess a spatial representation of time whereby the past is visualized on the left and the future is visualized on the right. Across four studies, the current research investigates whether and how this past-left, future-right conceptualization of time affects attitudes toward time-related products. Specifically, when consumers view advertisements in which product images are positioned congruently (incongruently) with their spatial representation of time, they have more (less) favorable attitudes toward the product. This effect occurs for both products that naturally involve the progression of time (e.g., self-improvement products) and also products for which a time component is a desired attribute (e.g., antiques). The effect of horizontal position reverses among consumers who read from right to left. The mediating role of processing fluency is highlighted as an underlying mechanism, and the moderating role of need for structure is identified.","['nanPERSONAL NEED', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'MENTAL REPRESENTATION', 'PERCEPTUAL FLUENCY', 'TIME', 'ENGLISH', 'PREFERENCE', 'JUDGMENTS', 'MANDARIN', 'LANGUAGE']",['time'],fluency need
"This paper examines the effect of international diversification on multinational corporation (MNC) performance in the face of exogenous shocks in the global business environment, and the extent to which MNCs' internationalization aids or impedes post-shock performance. We use the September 11, 2001 attacks as a research setting to investigate the relationship between international diversification and MNC performance after a sudden change in the environment. The empirical tests on a sample of 191 U. S. MNCs and a matched sample of non-U.S. MNCs indicate that the level of pre-September 11 international diversification is negatively correlated with immediate cumulative abnormal returns to shares, but positively correlated with longer-term performance.

"Given the argued importance of networks to new ventures, this paper is intended to fill a noted gap in the literature pertaining to the factors that influence the evolution of new ventures' alliance networks. Drawing on the imprinting literature, we propose that one has to look beyond the first partner per se, and instead focus on the extant relationships the initial partner has with other firms. More specifically, we argue and find that the network size and centrality of a new venture's initial alliance partner influence the subsequent size of the new venture's network.

Past attempts have largely looked internally within the organization far improvement, such as reflected by quality management, reengineering, downsizing, and restructuring. The next major source for competitive advantage likely will come from more outward orientation toward customers, as indicated by the many calls for organizations to compete on superior customer value delivery. Although the reasons for these calls are sound, what are the implications for managing organizations in the next decade and beyond? This article addresses this question. It presents frameworks for thinking about customer value, customer value learning, and the related skills that managers will need to create and implement superior customer value strategies.","['nanMARKET ORIENTATION', 'QUALITY', 'MODEL', 'DETERMINANTS', 'SATISFACTION', 'POSSESSIONS', 'PERCEPTIONS']",['quality'],frameworks
"By highlighting conditions under which viable interorganizational relationships do not materialize, we explore the limitations of interorganizational knowledge acquisition. In the empirical context of corporate venture capital (CVC), we analyze a sample of 1,646 start-up-stage ventures that received funding during the 1990s. Under a regime of weak intellectual property protection (IPP), an entrepreneur-CVC investment relationship is less likely to form when the entrepreneurial invention targets the same industry), as corporate products. In contrast, under a strong IPP regime, industry overlap is associated with an increase in the likelihood of an investment relationship. Our findings suggest that many relationships do not form because the corporation will not invest unless the entrepreneur discloses his or her invention, and the entrepreneur may be wary of doing so, fearing imitation. To the extent that a CVC has greater capability and inclination to target same-industry ventures, such industry overlap would exacerbate imitation concerns under a weak IPP regime, yet facilitate an investment relationship under a strong IPP regime. Beyond CVC, this insight may explain patterns of other interorganizational relationships, including research and development alliances and technology licensing between start-ups and incumbents.

In support of this argument, the capital that can exceed the benefits resulting from the lay-offs. In support of this argument, the results showed that downsizing had a negative effect on market returns and the effects grow increasingly negative with larger downsizing actions. However, the market reacts more positively to downsizing actions when reallocation strategies are used and to large downsizing actions when disengagement incentives are applied.

"Knowledge application is of key importance in the development of successful new products. Knowledge application refers to an organization's timely response to technological change by utilizing the knowledge and technology generated into new products and processes. This study uses the knowledge-based theory of the firm and considers its roots in the information-processing approach to organization theory to identify and structure potential antecedents of knowledge application. This study develops four hypotheses concerning antecedents of knowledge application. The hypotheses are tested using data collected from 277 high-technology firms. Empirical results indicate that a long-term orientation supported by a research and development (R&D) budget, formal rewards, and information technology directly increases the level of knowledge application, while R&D co-location indirectly increases the level of knowledge application. It is surprising to find that an increase in the level of organizational redundancy reduces the level of knowledge application. The findings also suggest that information technologies, lead-user, and supplier networks do not appear to significantly influence organizational redundancy.","['nanPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'IMPACT', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'TECHNOLOGIES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'TIES']","['antecedents', 'technologies']",firm

Using a sample of 211,636 patents from 1,644 companies during the period 1985-96, we find that the use of interdivisional knowledge positively affects the impact of an invention on subsequent technological developments. Furthermore, the positive effect of the use of interdivisional knowledge on the impact of an invention is stronger than the effect of using knowledge from within divisional boundaries or from outside firm boundaries. Our empirical findings have significant implications for the management of knowledge in diversified firms.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'PATENT CITATIONS', 'LOCAL SEARCH', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'ACQUIRING FIRMS', 'BOUNDARIES', 'ACQUISITIONS', 'CAPABILITIES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'RESOURCES']",['boundaries'],innovation impact management

"Unity and prototypicality are important visual aspects of product design. These design principles were operationalized by modifying line drawings of existing products. The results of four experiments provide evidence that these two factors positively affect aesthetic response, These effects were strongest when visual properties were the sole basis of judgment and when design variations were easily compared, However, they persisted when aesthetic aspects were combined with other product information and when comparing design features was difficult. The effect of unity was found to be superadditive, suggesting that it has a relational, all-or-none character. Finally, regression analyses show that direct effects of the design modifications on aesthetic response exist in addition to possible indirect effects that are mediated by perceived typicality.","['nanPREFERENCE', 'DETERMINANTS', 'CATEGORIES', 'QUALITY', 'INFORMATION', 'RECOGNITION', 'SIMILARITY', 'SEEKING', 'MEMORY']",['information'],information
"Recent research suggests that managers often make strategic decisions in novel situations by utilizing past experiences to reason by analogy. However, there is substantial evidence that decision makers often fail to identify and apply knowledge about one situation to a similarly structured situation. Two experimental studies investigated the mechanisms impacting knowledge transfer from one managerial situation (the source) to an analogous situation. The results show that exposure to variation in the source situation improves transfer performance. Variation decreases performance in the short term but improves learning and increases analogical transfer. Higher performance on and systematic search of the source situation also increase transfer performance. These results yield important implications for enhancing analogical transfer in strategic decision making and for future research on reasoning by analogy.

"Recognition of the firm's tendency toward local search has given vise to concepts celebrating exploration that overcomes this tendency. To move beyond local search requires that exploration span some boundary, be it organizational or technological. While several studies have encouraged boundary-spanning exploration, few have considered both types of boundaries systematically. In doing so, we create a typology of exploration behaviors: focal expforation spans neither boundary, external boundary-spanning exploration spans the firm boundary only, internal boundary-spanning exploration spans the technological boundary only, and radical exploration spans both boundaries. Using this typology, we analyze the impact of knowledge generated by these different types of exploration on subsequent technological evolution. In our study of patenting activity in optical disk technology, we find that exploration: that does not span organizational boundaries consistently generates lower impact on subsequent technological evolution. In addition, we find that the impact of exploration on subsequent technological evolution within the optical disk domain is highest when the exploration spans organizational boundaries but not technological boundaries. At the same time, we find that the impact of exploration on subsequent technological development beyond the optical disk domain is greatest When exploration spans both organizational and technological boundaries.

"Purpose This study aims to explore the importance and impact of supply and manufacturing risk management upon business performance within the context of Chinese manufacturing supply chains. Design/methodology/approach A two-phased multi-method approach was adopted, which included a survey questionnaire to practitioners in Chinese manufacturing supply chains followed by semi-structured interviews. The findings included 103 valid survey responses complemented by six semi-structured interviews. Findings The results indicate that in Chinese manufacturing context supply risk and manufacturing risk management are both vital for business performance. A high correlation between business and manufacturing risk management performance exists; however, no significant impact of supplier dependency, systematic purchasing, maturity of production and supply chain and human resources was found despite previously these elements being regarded as key influencers for supply and manufacturing risk management performance. The Chinese manufacturing supply chain indicated that elements such as the supplier and customer orientation, flexibility, manufacturing and supply risk highly connotes with business performance. Practical implications In the current unpredictable and volatile business environment, the competitiveness of manufacturing supply chains to a large extent depend on their ability to identify, assess and manage the manufacturing and supply risks. The findings of this study will assist supply chain managers in taking decision on manufacturing and supply risk management and reducing the uncertainty upon their business performance. Originality/value The supply chain risk has been widely explored within the context of individual case studies, or standalone models focusing on either supply or manufacturing risk in supply chains; however, to what extent this has been applicable to a wider context and its impact upon business process has not been explored. Hence, this study simultaneously has analysed manufacturing risk and supply risk and its impact upon Chinese manufacturing supply chains business performance. Moreover, this study uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, which is often limited in this area. Finally, the institutional theory lens offers novel insights in better understanding the factors that can affect the impact of supply and manufacturing risk management upon business performance in those contexts, such as China, where the institutional aspect presents specific features.","['China', 'Manufacturing', 'Performance', 'Empirical study', 'Supply chain disruptions', 'Supply riskINSTITUTIONAL THEORY PERSPECTIVE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MODEL', 'MITIGATION', 'IMPACT', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'INTEGRATION', 'STRATEGIES', 'DESIGN']","['china', 'manufacturing', 'performance', 'management', 'model', 'impact', 'uncertainty', 'design']",impact risk management business performance design
"We develop new theory and hypotheses on how a firm's top management team learns from acquisition experience, why, in consequence, the composition of the team is crucial, and how this affects acquisition frequency and success. We focus on the diversity of the top team and argue that heterogeneous teams, as compared to homogenous ones, acquire less but benefit more from their acquisition experience and are more successful with their acquisitions because they avoid mis-transferring their experiences. We tested our hypotheses on acquisition frequency and success using longitudinal data on more than 2,000 acquisitions by 25 Dutch companies over four decades (1966 to 2006).

"Consumers' judgments of the magnitude of benefit that a product provides increase their likelihood of purchasing it, and their judgments of the magnitude of harm that accrues from purchasing a product decrease their likelihood of purchasing it. When assessing the magnitude of a product's potential outcome, consumers often encounter information about its probability of occurring. Ten studies demonstrate that this information biases consumers' product decisions. Consumers both expect and perceive larger-probability outcomes to be larger in magnitude-even when they receive identical and objective information about the outcome's actual magnitude. This bias emerges because people believe that larger probabilities emanate from more powerful causal antecedents, and in turn expect more powerful antecedents to produce larger outcomes. Moreover, this bias shapes consumers' product decisions. Of course, it is rational for people to prefer products that promise high-probability benefits and to avoid products that produce high-probability harms. But consumers irrationally overweight this probability information because it distorts their judgments of the magnitude of products' benefits and harms, and this distortion biases their purchase decisions.","['product judgments', 'lay beliefs', 'probability perception', 'magnitude perceptionIMPACT BIAS', 'RISK', 'POWER', 'ASSIMILATION', 'CONTRAST', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'PEOPLE', 'SPECIFICATIONS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'EXPECTATIONS']","['power', 'people']",
"On the basis of a review of introspective methods in other social science disciplines, we identify five categories of introspection: (1) researcher introspection, (2) guided introspection, (3) interactive introspection, (4) syncretic combinations, and (5) reflexivity within research. We draw from this literature a set of six methodological issues relevant to the conduct of introspection in consumer research. Because of the recent publication of consumer behavior papers that rely extensively or even exclusively on the researchers' life experiences as data, we consider these methodological issues in detail regarding the conduct of researcher introspection. On the basis of substantive and methodological developments in other categories of introspection, researcher introspection is critiqued in terms of data collection and recording issues, its lack of separation of the roles of the researcher and introspector, and its exclusive focus on one individual. Because of the difficulties of overcoming critical methodological limitations inherent in this research approach, we conclude that researcher introspection has severely limited potential to contribute to future research in consumer behavior. In contrast, we suggest that appropriate use of guided introspection and reflexivity within research can be used to advance theory in consumer behavior. We conclude by discussing the balance between openness and rigor necessitated by the pluralistic composition of the field of consumer research.","['nanVERBAL REPORTS', 'CONSUMPTION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'INFORMATION', 'PSYCHOLOGY', 'CONSCIOUSNESS', 'AVAILABILITY', 'COVARIATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'REFLECTIONS']",['behavior'],
"The Internet has radically reduced the cost of collecting and distributing information. Consequently, researchers initially predicted that the resulting price transparency would drive prices toward a single market price. However, this has largely not happened, partly because retailers use shipping costs to make prices less comparable. Using data on 517,048 offers of 895 retailers from a leading European price comparison site, we show that retailers pursue two different shipping cost strategies. Both strategies lead to higher gross product prices, which are the sum of net product price and shipping costs and thus try to capture consumer surplus. These strategies are conflicting, however, and target different consumer segments: Some retailers charge high shipping costs and thereby try to exploit consumers' biased perceptions of partitioned prices, while other retailers offer free shipping to attract consumers and exploit their so-called zero-risk bias. Consumers realize the lowest gross product prices by ordering at retailers that charge moderate shipping costs.","['Electronic commerce', 'e-tail', 'price comparison', 'pricing', 'shipping costsYOUR-OWN-PRICE', 'ELECTRONIC MARKETS', 'E-COMMERCE', 'INTERNET', 'CONSUMER', 'DISPERSION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'ONLINE', 'COMPETITION', 'DECISIONS']","['price comparison', 'price comparison', 'internet', 'consumer']",price transparency shipping costs

We conduct an in-depth case study of four small firms to provide insight on how and why a portfolio of network relationships (e.g., suppliers, distributors, customers, and research institutes) helps small new innovative firms to gain resources. We develop a framework of four innovation types and expand on how successful commercialization for each innovation type requires certain types and strength of relationships. Both types (systemic and autonomous) of radical innovations require strong collaborative ties with customers, whereas incremental innovations are commercialized through different types of downstream networks.","['nanENTREPRENEURIAL FIRMS', 'TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'START-UPS', 'VENTURES', 'GROWTH', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TIES', 'EMBEDDEDNESS', 'EXPERIENCE']",['ties'],firms networks

Using informational reports on quality, empowerment, and teams, as well as a measure of the implementation of total quality management programs, we found that companies associated with popular management techniques did not have higher economic performance. Nevertheless, these same companies were more admired, perceived to be more innovative, and rated higher in management quality. Higher pay was also given to chief executives when their companies were associated with these management trends. These results provide strong support for institutional theory, demonstrating how both internal and external legitimacy can be gained by using popular management techniques. They also extend institutional theory from its usual emphasis on organization-environment relations to new within-firm dynamics.","['nanTOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL IMITATION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL LEGITIMACY', 'FORMAL-STRUCTURE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'FIRM', 'COMPENSATION', 'INCENTIVES', 'DIFFUSION', 'BEHAVIOR']",['firm'],teams performance

Rather, in many low-income countries, one can observe productive entrepreneurship but little corresponding development. This is the puzzle of entrepreneurship and development. To solve this puzzle, we propose to look at the notions of local and systemic entrepreneurship.

The study uses agency theory to discuss why SOEs display little entrepreneurial behavior and how privatization may alter this situation by changing firms' systems of controls and incentives. The study also uses a sample of Spanish firms for its empirical research. Data on these firms were available for three years before and after privatization. The findings show that corporate entrepreneurship increases after privatization when firms are in highly competitive industries, either because competition was greater after privatization or because the firm was already in a highly competitive industry. In summary, corporate entrepreneurship in privatized firms seems to be favored by two factors, a change of ownership and competition. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

"Work recovery research has focused mainly on how after-work break activities help employees replenish their resources and reduce fatigue. Given that employees spend a considerable amount of time at work, understanding how they can replenish their resources during the workday is critical. Drawing on ego depletion (Muraven & Baumeister, 2000) and self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), we employed multi-source experience sampling methods to test the effects of a critical boundary condition, employee lunch break autonomy, on the relation between lunch break activities and end-of-workday fatigue. Although specific energy-relevant activities had a main effect on end-of-workday fatigue, each of these was moderated by the degree of autonomous choice associated with the break. Specifically, for activities that supported the psychological needs of relatedness and competence (i.e., social and work activities, respectively), as lunch break autonomy increased, effects switched from increasing fatigue to reducing fatigue. To the extent that lunch break activities involved relaxation, however, lunch break autonomy was only important when levels of relaxation were low. We conclude that lunch break autonomy plays a complex and pivotal role in conferring the potential energetic benefits of lunch break activities.

"A resource-based theory postulate is that firms must defend their resources against imitation to sustain competitive advantage. However, by deterring imitation, firms may induce rivals to create substitutes. This study shows that, contrary to received wisdom, firms are not uniformly inclined to deter resource imitation. Rather, this inclination decreases in response to substitution threat. By examining how firms manage the trade-off between inimitability and nonsubstitutability, this study suggests that the scenario wherein firms have omnipotent resources that are both inimitable and nonsubstitutable may be unrealistic and that managing the tension between these two attributes is key to sustainable competitive advantage.","['nanRESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY', 'TECHNOLOGICAL DISCONTINUITIES', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'PATENT LITIGATION', 'ENTRY-DETERRENCE', 'DOMINANT DESIGNS']","['sustainable competitive advantage', 'sustainable competitive advantage', 'sustainable competitive advantage']",firms competitive advantage
This paper examines how public market information relates to the initiation of venture capital projects. Analysis of venture capital investments in the U.S. between 1980 and 2007 indicates that venture capitalists tend to defer new investment projects in target industries with substantial market volatility. This delay effect of market volatility is reduced if the target industry experiences high sales growth or if competition among venture capitalists is intense in the target industry. The paper provides further evidence to corroborate the view that venture capitalists rationally respond to market shifts in their investment decisions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The goal is to apply scientific understanding to advance our ability to design, improve, and scale service systems. To make progress, we think service dominant logic provides just the right perspective, vocabulary, and assumptions on which to build a theory of service systems, their configurations, and their modes of interaction. Simply put, service-dominant logic may be the philosophical foundation of service science, and the service system may be its basic theoretical construct.","['service science', 'service systems', 'service-dominant logicSYSTEMS']","['service science', 'service science', 'service systems', 'service systems']",service systems creation technology systems innovation dominant logic
"This research explores the relative influence of salespeople's attitudes toward selling a new product, perceptions of subjective norms, and self-efficacy on the development of selling intentions and, ultimately, the success of a new product launch. The longitudinal study employs a nonlinear growth curve model that leverages survey data from industrial salespeople and objective performance records of their daily sales during the first several months in the market of two new products: a new-to-market product and a line extension. By examining salesperson-level variance on new product performance, the authors suggest that managers should focus on increasing salesperson self-efficacy and positive attitudes toward selling the product to build selling intentions and quickly grow new product performance. They also suggest that sales managers should resist the temptation to rely on normative pressure during a new product introduction. Not only are subjective norms less effective in building selling intentions, but they also diminish the positive impact of attitudes and self-efficacy on salesperson intentions and constrain the positive relationships between intentions and performance and self-efficacy and performance.","['new product sales', 'theory of planned behavior', 'managerial influence', 'multilevel growth curve modelingSALES FORCE', 'FIRM VALUE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'ADOPTION', 'TAKEOFF', 'LEVEL', 'DETERMINANTS', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'BEHAVIOR']","['performance', 'level']",norms self efficacy selling intentions model performance
"The article initially addresses the concept of familiness and its connection with the succession process in the family firm to emphasize the relevance of the successor's knowledge. Then, a model is presented that evolves from a dyadic relationship in the knowledge transfer process from predecessor to successor to a network of exchanges with multiple agents and sources that enhance the successor's construction of knowledge through time. Key aspects derived from that model about the successor's human capital, the predecessor's role, the knowledge network, the relational context, and the time dimension of the process are then discussed.","['succession', 'familiness', 'knowledge construction', 'knowledge network', 'succession evolutionSTRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'INTERGENERATIONAL SUCCESSION', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'CAPITAL PERSPECTIVE', 'NEXT-GENERATION', 'FUTURE-RESEARCH', 'VALUE CREATION', 'CAPABILITIES', 'BUSINESS', 'PERFORMANCE']","['succession', 'familiness', 'knowledge network', 'knowledge network']",firm knowledge transfer
"Psychological contract violation (PCV) is employee negative emotions aroused by employers not delivering their promises. Past studies have used Social Exchange Theory to explain the effects of PCV on employee responses specified in the EVLN (i.e., Exit, Voice, Loyalty and Neglect) model. The present study argues that Activation Theory may also be applied to explain employee responses to PCV for Chinese employees due to the specific role of emotions in Chinese culture. Both theories receive some supports in a Chinese employee sample (n = 439). Results and implications are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"People face adverse events in a variety of forms. Some individuals are resilient to adverse events in that they are able to maintain positive functioning while others experience considerable disruption. In explaining heterogeneity in resilience, research has emphasized people's resource endowments and pre-adversity organizing prior to the adverse events as well as people's cognitive and behavioral responses to such events. Therefore, for most resilience studies, adversity is an event. Although it is critically important to understand resilience to these short- to medium-term adverse events, there is a need to understand resilience over an extended period. In this regard, we focus on Palestine refugees who were born in refugee camps and as adults have known nothing other than being a refugee. When it comes to substantial and persistent adversity, entrepreneurial action likely plays a central role in resilience to such adversity. To explore these relationships, we conducted an extensive data-collection effort over 15 months on refugee entrepreneurs (in refugee camps and not in camps), including 110 interviews. We find the importance of direct, indirect, and recursive relationships among actions (i.e., entrepreneurial action and integration activities), multiple identities, and resilience outcomes under conditions of substantial and persistent adversity. Furthermore, we find important differences between refugee entrepreneurs who live in refugee camps and those who live outside these camps-differences in affiliation, language use, and social capital development-which enable those refugee entrepreneurs living outside the refugee camps to achieve resilience outcomes not accessible to those living inside the camps. Overall, this study makes a number of contributions to the entrepreneurship literature. First, research has investigated resilience in terms of resources, endowments, and capabilities before an adverse event. The implicit assumptions in this research are that capabilities matter and that adversity has a beginning and subsides over time. In this study, we focus on resilience outcomes in the context of refugees facing substantial adversity over a substantial period and extend the capability argument of resilience in the following ways: (1) the social capability for resilience, not as an endowment but created through activities that build a social basis for resilience outcomes, (2) social integration activities are initiated and facilitated by engaging in entrepreneurial action with non-similar others, and (3) resilience outcomes help individuals both engage in integration activities and build a social capability of resilience. Therefore, in the context of substantial and persistent adversity, refugee entrepreneurs need to act in order to build (rather than simply deploy) their social capability for resilience outcomes. Second, resilience has been explored as either a process or as an outcome. In this study, we find that resilience outcomes are both a consequence and an antecedent of entrepreneurial action-a mutually dependent relationship. Specifically, we find the dimensions of resilience outcomes to include proactive problem solving, moral gains as a broader purpose in life, self-reliance, realistic optimism, and multiple sources of belonging. What is interesting is that these outcomes are also important inputs to entrepreneurial action and the resilience process. Finally, there has been an important stream of research on the role of identity in recovery from adversity. We find that refugee entrepreneurs' actions provide a basis for changing the mix of their multiple identities. Therefore, we enrich the entrepreneurship identity literature through the insight that in this persistently adverse context, the relationship between entrepreneurial action and identity is not one way and static but bidirectional and dynamic. Furthermore, over and above refugee entrepreneurs' prosocial motivation of compassion, we find a new form of prosocial motivation for entrepreneurial action-the motivation to promote solidarity: You are not alone; we are in this together as part of a broader purpose in life.","['nanPOSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER', 'PALESTINIAN REFUGEES', 'SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS', 'MULTIPLE IDENTITIES', 'POSITIVE EMOTIONS', 'HIGH-RELIABILITY', 'WELL', 'SELF', 'GROWTH', 'SENSEMAKING']","['multiple identities', 'multiple identities', 'well', 'self']",people adverse
"When will individuals speak up about organizational issues, and when will they remain silent? We suggest that organizational voice win be significantly influenced by individuals' perceptions of the attitudes towards an issue within their workgroup. In particular, individuals will be more likely to speak up when they believe that their position is supported by others, and remain silent when they believe that it is not. We explain this using the 'spiral of silence' proposed by Noelle-Neumann (1974, 1985, 1991) and widely used in public opinion research, which explains how majority opinions become dominant over time and minority opinions weakened. Spirals of silence within groups can restrict the open and honest discussion that is essential to organizational improvement. Noelle-Neumann's spiral of silence emphasizes the horizontal pressures that the threat of isolation and corresponding fear of isolation exert to keep people from being open and honest about their opinions. We argue in this paper that the fear and threat of isolation are particularly powerful for members of invisible minorities such as gay and lesbian employees. We propose a second, vertical 'spiral of silence' may develop through processes at a more micro level within the workgroup, and organization. This second spiral begins with the inability to fully express one's personal identity within the workgroup because of a negative climate of opinion towards a particular aspect of one's identity. This may be especially true for 'Invisible' sources of diversity such as sexual orientation. Revealing a potentially disruptive identity might impair social cohesion: concealing it, however, can inhibit social exchange and task exchange and reduce self-efficacy, leading to organizational silence. However, an alternate virtuous spiral can result in which individuals will feel empowered to express organizational voice.","['nanSOCIAL IDENTITY', 'DEMOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY', 'RELATIONAL DEMOGRAPHY', 'SEXUAL ORIENTATION', 'CONTEXT', 'GENDER', 'MANAGEMENT', 'WORKPLACE', 'WOMEN', 'DISSIMILARITY']","['sexual orientation', 'sexual orientation']",opinion
"P>This paper examines empirically the determinants of offshore location choice between country clusters. Based on a dataset of 1722 R&D projects by MNEs located in developed and emerging countries, we examine the impact of home and host country, industry, and firm level variables on choice of location. We draw on the extended OLI paradigm to develop our hypotheses. Using the EU15 as a base group, a multinomial logit model is estimated between the regions of USA&Canada, Eastern Europe&Russia, emerging countries of Asia, and India&China. At the regional level, findings show that the R&D wage difference and knowledge infrastructure difference between home and host countries, the science and engineering talent pool size, and political risk level of host countries are important determining factors. At the firm level, experience of overseas R&D projects and prior experience of research in the host country are found to be important location determinants. A distinguishing feature of the paper is that we examine regions in relation to a base region, and then further examine the impact of a marginal change in independent variables on the likelihood of the choice of a region for new offshore R&D projects.","['nanFOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISES', 'FIRMS', 'INNOVATION', 'INTERNATIONALIZATION', 'GLOBALIZATION', 'CORPORATIONS', 'STRATEGIES', 'MARKETS', 'MODEL']",['model'],firm
"The 1980s acquisitions are widely believed to have unwound the conglomerate boom of the 1960s through horizontal mergers, yet alternative forms of unwinding have not been examined. This study tests the explanation that changes in the opportunity to share resources and activities among businesses of the firm may have contributed to post-acquisition performance improvements in the recent acquisition wave. After estimating the sources of competitive performance that are due to these changes within each of 356 manufacturing industries, the study calculates predictions of changes in competitive performance for each acquired business between 1980 and 1984. The predictions are positive and in turn are positively associated with change in competitive performance between 1984 and 1986. This finding highlights the importance of resource sharing and activity sharing in these acquisitions, and leads to the reexamination of theories for the second acquisition wave that are supported by the finding of horizontal acquisitions.","['acquisition', 'diversification', 'synergy', 'interrelationshipsDIVERSIFIED SERVICE FIRMS', 'R-AND-D', 'VERTICAL INTEGRATION', 'MARKET-STRUCTURE', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'CORPORATE ACQUISITION', 'ENTROPY MEASURE', 'TOBIN-Q', 'INDUSTRY', 'STRATEGY']",['acquisition'],1980s acquisitions horizontal acquisitions
"The popular business press and academic articles have promoted the virtues of failure, particularly in the pursuit of innovation. Surprisingly, there has been very little systematic empirical study to support this belief. This article distinguishes two organizational approaches to failure: normalizing it (tolerating failure as a necessary part of the innovation process) and analyzing it (purposeful attempts to convert failure experiences into knowledge). A longitudinal study of 106 U.S. manufacturing firms indeed finds that mere tolerance for failure has no effect on firm product innovativeness. In contrast, firms that make deliberate efforts to analyze past failures introduce more innovative new products. Further, this effect is contingent on a climate of constructive conflict within the firm. Hence, to foster firm innovativeness, organization members need to extract lessons from failure, and such analysis must take place in a climate of constructive conflict that enables open and honest discussion.","['Tolerance for failure', 'Learning from failure', 'Constructive conflict', 'New product exploration', 'New product advantageSTRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING', 'PRODUCT INNOVATIVENESS', 'ERROR MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'WORK', 'EMOTIONS', 'LEARN', 'DIMENSIONS', 'CONFLICT', 'CULTURE']","['tolerance for failure', 'tolerance for failure', 'tolerance for failure', 'constructive conflict', 'constructive conflict', 'product innovativeness', 'product innovativeness', 'conflict']",innovation
"This article examines the economic worth of product placement in movies over a time span of 40 years (1968-2007). The authors find an inverted U-shaped relationship between the year of the movie release and the returns associated with product placements. In addition, a similar inverted U-shaped relationship characterizes the economic worth of tie-in campaigns associated with product placements. These findings are consistent with the habituation tedium theory used to explain the inverted U-shaped pattern in response to novel advertisements and suggest that the same mechanism could be influencing the response to an entire marketing medium. Overall, the results reinforce the notion that marketers find it increasingly difficult to get their message across using traditional media and underscore the need for the marketing industry to reinvent itself when new tactics lose their luster.

"The current study examined employee outcomes associated with customer mistreatment, conceptualizing customer mistreatment as signaling failure regarding employees' pursuit of task and social goals at work. We argue that employees make internal attributions when experiencing customer mistreatment and are likely to engage in rumination because of this perceived goal failure. The goal of this article was to test this conceptualization and examine the outcomes of customer mistreatment-induced rumination as well as emotional labor strategies as potential protective mechanisms against customer mistreatment. Findings from time-lagged data collected from 737 call-center customer representatives indicated that cognitive rumination mediated the relationship between customer mistreatment and supervisor-rated job performance, customer-directed sabotage, employee well-being, and emotional exhaustion. The second mediator, social sharing of negative events, mediated the relationship between customer mistreatment and emotional exhaustion only. As expected, cognitive rumination was positively related to customer sabotage and emotional exhaustion and negatively related to job performance and well-being. Social sharing of negative events was positively related to both well-being and emotional exhaustion. Finally, we found that deep acting, but not surface acting, buffered the effects of customer mistreatment on cognitive rumination and social sharing. Limitations, future research directions, and managerial implications are discussed.","['customer mistreatment', 'cognitive rumination', 'social rumination', 'social sharing of negative events', 'well-being', 'productivity', 'emotional exhaustion', 'sabotageEMOTIONAL LABOR', 'CO-RUMINATION', 'NEGATIVE AFFECT', 'TRADE-OFFS', 'WORK', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'MINDFULNESS', 'EXHAUSTION', 'AGGRESSION', 'LIFE']","['customer mistreatment', 'customer mistreatment', 'cognitive rumination', 'cognitive rumination', 'social sharing of negative events', 'social sharing of negative events', 'social sharing of negative events', 'social sharing of negative events', 'social sharing of negative events', 'well being', 'well being', 'emotional exhaustion', 'emotional exhaustion', 'work', 'exhaustion']",rumination labor sabotage
"The literature investigating the degree to which firm performance is associated with industry, or corporate factors has recently been subject to criticism on the grounds of both methodological shortcomings and incomplete interpretation of results. Our research goes beyond these critiques to raise more basic issues concerning the assumptions underlying variance decomposition, the methodology dominating the antecedent literature. Performance data and categorizations from a sample consistent with those employed in the recent literature are analyzed via a new non-parametric methodology. Results here indicate that corporate factors were over an order of magnitude better predictors of business unit profit position than were industry factors-which were found not to have been significant predictors. Further, underlying performance relationships were seen to have shifted over time. A key implication of these results for researchers is that they provide additional evidence that managers can have a strategic influence on business performance.

"Numerous studies have focused on CEO charisma as an antecedent to firm performance, but this literature has largely overlooked the possibility that charisma manifests in more proximal strategic initiatives that (unlike performance) are largely under the CEO's control. In this study, we integrate perspectives from the upper echelons and charismatic leadership literatures to argue that CEO charisma influences year-over-year strategic change, the degree to which strategies deviate from industry central tendencies, and the degree of emphasis on corporate social responsibility. We also theorize that, depending on the outcome in question, the effects of charisma can become both amplified and diminished as CEO tenure advances. Employing a novel data collection approach for a sample of 113 S&P 500 CEOs, we find broad support for our theory.

"This paper presents a systematic review of recent academic literature analysing the role, organization and management of marketing activities in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To this end, 310 articles published between 2006 and 2015 in 69 main journals devoted to small firms/entrepreneurship and management/marketing fields were analysed. This review shows that SMEs' marketing has received great attention in both management and marketing literature in recent years. Findings reveal, on the one hand, the emerging role of networks and information and communication technologies in marketing behaviour by SMEs, and on the other hand a research gap in terms of specific marketing practices. Entrepreneurial marketing has been used as the main conceptual framework in reviewed studies, even if findings overall still point out a distance between the theoretical bases of reviewed contributions and the study of SMEs' marketing behaviour and practices. Therefore, future research on the role of resources, relationships and networks could benefit from the combination of theories developed within the field of entrepreneurship with other approaches such as the resource-based view, the dynamic capabilities theory and the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing (IMP) framework.","['nanMEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES', 'ELECTRONIC COMMERCE ADOPTION', 'E-CRM ACTIVITIES', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION', 'SMALL BUSINESS', 'PRODUCT INNOVATION', 'EXPORT PERFORMANCE', 'FOREIGN-MARKET', 'SOCIAL MEDIA', 'SMALL FIRMS']","['small firms', 'small firms']",smes small firms entrepreneurship dynamic capabilities
"Research summary: This paper examines the role of equity-based incentives in fostering cross-business-unit collaboration in multibusiness firms. We develop a formal agency model in which headquarters offers equity and profit incentives to business-unit managers with the objective of maximizing total expected firm returns. The resulting compensation contract provides a rich mechanism for aggregating value from collaborative interactions across business units, aligning managers' efforts with the firm's growth prospects and organization structure and managing the dual risks in profits and firm market value. The inclusion of equity incentives elicits higher levels of own-unit and collaborative efforts over the profits-only contract. Our results suggest that equity-based incentives are most beneficial when profitability is uncertain relative to long-term growth prospects, in firms pursuing related diversification strategies, and in periods of rising equity markets. Managerial summary: Equity-based compensation such as restricted stock grants and options are increasingly common, not only for CEOs and other top executives, but also for business unit managers and other non-C-suite employees. The paper studies the role of such global incentives in enabling multibusiness firms to benefit from cross-unit collaboration. Results from our model show that managerial contracts that include appropriate levels of equity incentives, in addition to profit-based incentives, generate higher own-unit and collaborative efforts. We also find that equity incentives are likely to be most beneficial for large firms in high-growth sectors, for firms pursuing a related diversification strategy, and in periods of rising stock markets. The model can also provide useful guidance on designing return-maximizing compensation contracts for business unit managers in different firm, organizational, and industry contexts.

"This paper looks at the evolution of capabilities in the Hollywood movie industry in the aftermath of the transition from a studio era dominated by integrated hierarchies to a post-studio era dominated by flexible hub organizations supplied by networks of resource providers. Adopting a dynamic capabilities perspective we argue that two industry capabilities - mobilizing and transforming capabilities - play a crucial role in assembling and transforming resource bundles into feature films. We further argue that the transition to new organizational forms shifts the coevolutionary process, with practices and routines that make up mobilizing capabilities changing faster and becoming more important to box office success than practices and routines that make up transforming capabilities. We test our hypotheses using a sample of 400 films split between the studio and post-studio eras. The results support our hypotheses, pointing to the influence of centralized control versus dispersed access to resources. The strategy of integrated hierarchical organizations depends on ownership of resources that reduces incentives to develop mobilizing capabilities, and increases incentives to develop transforming capabilities. The advent of new organizational forms, by contrast, increases returns to new practices and routines that mobilize resources at the expense of returns on exploring practices and routines that make up transforming capabilities.","['nanFLEXIBLE SPECIALIZATION', 'FILM INDUSTRY', 'CO-EVOLUTION', 'COEVOLUTION', 'INNOVATION', 'STRATEGY', 'CAREERS', 'COSTS', 'LABOR']","['coevolution', 'strategy']",movie
"Despite the widely acknowledged importance of concerted efforts between service teams and their leaders for increasing service quality, little is known about how and why congruent or divergent perceptions at the team-leader interface affect team performance. Drawing on theories from the field of sociocognitive psychology and from extant team literature, this study develops a research model that investigates crucial effect mechanisms of perceptual congruence between service teams and their leaders on team performance. Perceptual congruence is operationalized by examining agreement between teams and their leaders on three key team factors: service leadership, service commitment, and service systems. Analyzing leader, member, and customer survey responses from a large sample of service teams, we demonstrate that perceptual congruence between service teams and their leaders can, in and of itself, have an impact on team performance. Moreover, our results reveal the relevance of nonlinear effect mechanisms arising from perceptual congruence. These patterns illustrate the pervasive and intricate effects of perceptual congruence on team performance, highlighting the importance of developing awareness of the alignment of perceptions in the relationship between service teams and their leaders. Managers striving to encourage particular behaviors can use our results to direct customer-contact service teams more effectively.","['perceptual congruence', 'service teams', 'team-leader relationship', 'team performance', 'sociocognitive theoriesPOLYNOMIAL REGRESSION', 'ROLE AMBIGUITY', 'MENTAL MODELS', 'SATISFACTION', 'IMPACT', 'GOAL', 'ENCOUNTERS', 'SIMILARITY', 'EMPLOYEES', 'COGNITION']","['perceptual congruence', 'perceptual congruence', 'service teams', 'service teams', 'team performance', 'team performance', 'impact']",leadership commitment
"The themes of organizing and sensemaking have reverberated throughout Weick's remarkable career and constitute one of the hallmarks of his contribution. We review his major works and show how Weick differentially emphasizes organizing and sensemaking over time and, eventually, arrives at a fuller integration of meaning and action. Initially, Weick (1969; 1979) models their relationship as linear, focusing on how organizing functioned as a context for sensemaking, an approach we labelSensemaking in Organizing. Later, however, Weick (1995a; 2005) construes their relationship in more dynamic, interactive, and reciprocal cycles, modelling sensemaking as the process whereby organizing is achieved, an approach we labelSensemaking as Organizing. We explore the evolution and implications of these approaches and discuss their impact on management scholarship.

"Research Summary: We study the use of corporate philanthropy as a form of reputation insurance, developing a formal model of such insurance to examine how the terms of insurance in equilibrium change under different assumptions about the firm and its stakeholders. We then test the predictions from this model in the U.S. petroleum industry and find that philanthropic donations offer insurance-like benefits, but are also positively associated with subsequent oil spills-firms that give more, spill more-with this association being stronger for spills that are under firms' control and in states with low civic capacity. These results are consistent with an adverse selection/moral hazard equilibrium and suggest that the use of philanthropy as reputation insurance may benefit firms at the cost of society. Managerial Summary: Firms that donate to social causes develop a reputation for being socially responsible, and are often given the benefit of doubt when negative information about them comes to light. But are philanthropic firms truly more responsible? We argue that firms that donate more may be more likely to do harm-those that expect to do harm later are likely to give more now, and those that know their reputation protects them may become less careful. Evidence from the U.S. petroleum industry is consistent with this argument, with firms that give more having more subsequent oil spills, but only the type of spills that are under the firm's control, and only in states where the firm faces weaker scrutiny.","['corporate philanthropy', 'formal model', 'information asymmetry', 'insurance', 'social impactCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS', 'PRIVATE REGULATION', 'SELF-REGULATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'RISK', 'IRRESPONSIBILITY', 'STAKEHOLDERS', 'GOVERNANCE']","['corporate philanthropy', 'corporate philanthropy', 'formal model', 'formal model', 'insurance', 'stakeholders']",corporate philanthropy reputation insurance adverse selection
"This paper attempts to operationalize and measure firm-specific capabilities using an extant conceptualization in the resource-based view (RBV) literature. Capabilities are conceived as the efficiency with which a firm employs a given set of resources (inputs) at its disposal to efficiency certain objectives (outputs). We expand on extant theoretical literature on relative capabilities, by delineating the conditions that have to be met for relative capabilities to be measured non-tautologically. We then proceed to suggest an estimation methodology, stochastic frontier estimation (SFE), that allows us to infer firm capabilities. We illustrate this technique with a sample of firms in the semiconductor industry. Our findings underscore the heterogeneity in R&D capability across firms in this industry, as well as the persistence in these capabilities over time. We also find that the market rewards high R&D capability firms, in that they show the highest average values of Tobin's q.

"When consumers use brands with appealing personalities, does the brand's personality rub off on them? The answer is yes, but only for consumers who hold certain beliefs about their personality. Entity theorists perceive themselves to be better looking, more feminine, and more glamorous after using a Victoria's Secret shopping bag (study 1) and more intelligent, more of a leader, and harder working after using an MIT pen (study 2); incremental theorists are unaffected. In two subsequent studies, we find that entity theorists use brands with appealing personalities to signal their positive qualities, thereby enhancing self-perceptions in line with the brand's personality. These findings implicate implicit self-theories as a key factor in understanding how brand experiences affect consumers.","['nanIMPLICIT THEORIES', 'LAY THEORIES', 'SELF-PRESENTATION', 'GOALS', 'PERCEPTION', 'ACHIEVEMENT', 'MOTIVATION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'STYLES']",['perception'],personality implicit
"Much of the existing research on innovation has concentrated on the study of individuals in small group settings. However, projects marked by multiple teams, high task interdependence, long duration, and large scale have become increasingly common in practice. Very little is known about how extant research findings related to innovation may generalize to such complex settings. Taking a multilevel theoretical approach, individuals' propensity to innovate is hypothesized as the product of individuals' relationship with their work team (team member identification) and their team's relationship to other teams within the organizational system (interteam interdependence). A large, diversified manufacturing firm engaged in a multibillion dollar project that involved the development of a technologically intense, highly innovative, new product served as the research site. Based on archival and survey data (n=118), five hypotheses were tested. The findings indicate that individuals' strong team identification and their perceptions of high interteam interdependence each had positive main effects on individuals' intentions to innovate. However, these two variables also interacted negatively to significantly decrease innovation intentions. Therefore, high identification with team may lead individuals to view interdependence with another team as a threat deflecting attention from innovation. The finding related to the role of identity, although consistent with work linking identity to other team behaviors, usefully broadens the reach of identification theories to demonstrate their impact on innovation. Additionally, this study is the first to demonstrate the impact of interteam interdependence on innovation. The alternative operationalizations of interdependence used in this paper highlight the fact that it must be strongly perceived and experienced by individuals to affect their innovation attitudes. The findings of this study also have implications for managerial practice in complex project settings. Since team identification has a direct effect on innovation, managers might employ strategies related to the creation of social bonds to complement task related connections among team members. Further, managers should configure staffing and incentive mechanisms to reinforce team identification. Finally, the results suggest that managers need to carefully attend to individuals' perceptions of each team's interdependence with other teams. Although perceptual interdependence can be an enabler of innovation, it can also be a disabler, through its interaction with team identification. Recognizing this potential for negative effects, managers might emphasize the benefits that can come from cooperating across teams, thus encouraging team members to identify not only at the team level but at the overall project level as well. Such actions might deflect negative identity threats that can derail positive innovation intentions.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'WORK', 'CREATIVITY', 'INTEGRATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'TASK', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'COOPERATION']","['work', 'task', 'identification']",identity
"We investigate the impact of political institutions on corporate risk-taking. Using a large sample of non-financial firms from 77 countries covering the period from 1988 to 2008, we find that sound political institutions are positively associated with corporate risk-taking, and that this relation is stronger when government extraction is higher. In a subsample of 45 countries, we also find that politically connected firms engage in more risk-taking, which suggests that close ties to the government lead to less conservative investment choices. Our results are economically significant, and are robust to alternative risk-taking measures, various political institution proxies, cross-sectional and country-level regressions, and endogeneity concerns of political institutions. Our results have important implications for governments and corporate managers by providing direct relevance of political institutions to the corporate decision-making process. To encourage investment at the firm level, and hence innovation and overall growth, governments need to undertake the necessary reforms to control corruption and enforce contracts better, and thus decrease government predation and extraction.

"Previous research has found that dissatisfied consumers choose to seek redress, engage in negative word-of-mouth behavior, and exit (i.e., vow never to repatronize the retailer) based upon the perceived likelihood of successful redress, their attitude toward complaining, the level of importance they attach to the defective product, and whether they perceive the problem to be stable or to have been controllable. The authors extend previous research by modeling consumer complaining behavior as a complex, dynamic process, hypothesizing that once a consumer seeks redress, negative word-of-mouth behavior and repatronage intentions are dependent (primarily) upon the consumer's post-complaint perception of justice. As hypothesized, perceived justice was found to be the main determinant of complainants' negative word-of-mouth behavior and their repatronage intentions, and was found to mediate the effects of likelihood of success, attitude toward complaining, product importance, and stability and controllability on complaining behavior. The model fit the data very well, explaining 49.1 percent of the variance of negative word-of-mouth and 68.5 percent of the variance of repatronage intentions. These findings point to the importance of customer service/customer satisfaction, especially since the cost of keeping a current customer satisfied is much less than the cost of attracting a new customer.","['nanCONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS', 'CONSUMER SATISFACTION', 'FIT INDEXES', 'GOODNESS', 'DISSATISFACTION', 'RESPONSES', 'MODEL']",['model'],consumers word of mouth behavior modeling
"A fundamental distinction between goods and services is that in the retailing of goods and some services the costs of production and distribution are clearly separable in a non-arbitrary fashion, usually identified as costs of goods sold. They have type I separability. Distribution services, which are also known as attributes, marketing mix or output variables, are produced, distributed and consumed just as goods or physical products or core services sold directly to consumers at an explicit price. When online settings generate separability of production distribution and consumption of all these distribution services in space and time we have strong type II separability, which has not been identified in the literature. The latter plays an essential role in the emergence, sustainability and sometimes dominance of online channels. It has profound implications for both the demand side and the supply side of firms in online channels. We develop implications of this result with respect to potential maximum levels of these services in electronic channels and for a broad range of other important topics relevant for marketing and economics.

"Preservice tips are becoming increasingly common in the marketplace (e.g., online food delivery, quick-service restaurants). While prior research has investigated how the practice of preservice tipping is perceived by customers, how preservice tipping impacts the perceptions and behaviors of employees remains unexplored. Does tipping early actually elicit better service? Through a series of four studies, our research compares the effectiveness of tips-a financial incentive, with compliments-a nonfinancial incentive. The results indicate that early tips and compliments are both effective in obtaining better service, but the relative effectiveness of a tip versus a compliment depends on the service context. In closed service contexts-which involve a continuous, relatively short interaction-tips are superior. For example, when getting a drink at a bar, buying a sandwich at a quick-service restaurant, or dropping off a car for valet parking, tipping early should lead to better customer service. In contrast, in open service contexts-which involve multiple interactions over a more extended period and provide an opportunity for a social connection-compliments become more effective. The results have practical implications for customers wishing to enhance their service experiences and for managers in motivating their employees.","['persuasion', 'tipping', 'compliments', 'open versus closed contextsVALUE CO-CREATION', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'SERVICE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'INGRATIATION', 'SATISFACTION', 'GRATUITIES', 'PREDICTION', 'IMPACT', 'NORM']","['tipping', 'compliments', 'service', 'behavior', 'impact']",preservice tips employees compliments
"Newly launched products in the consumer goods and services markets show high failure rates. To reduce the failure rates, companies can integrate innovative and knowledgeable customers, the so-called lead users, into the new product development process. However, the detection of such lead users is difficult, especially in consumer product markets with very large customer bases. A new and potentially valuable approach toward the identification of lead users involves the use of virtual stock markets, which have been proposed and applied for political and business forecasting but not for the identification of experts such as lead users. The basic concept of virtual stock markets is bringing a group of participants together via the Internet and allowing them to trade shares of virtual stocks. These stocks represent a bet on the outcome of future market situations, and their value depends on the realization of these market situations. In this process, a virtual stock market elicits and aggregates the assessments of its participants concerning future market developments. Virtual stock markets might also serve as a feasible instrument to filter out lead users, primarily for the following two reasons. First, a self-selection effect might occur because sophisticated consumers with a higher involvement in the product of interest decide to participate in virtual stock markets. Second, a performance effect is likely to arise because well-performing participants in virtual stock markets show a better understanding of the market than their (already self-selected) fellow participants. So far, only limited information exists about these two effects and their relation to lead user characteristics. The goal of this paper is to analyze the feasibility of virtual stock markets for the identification of lead users. The results of this empirical study show that virtual stock markets can be an effective instrument to identify lead users in consumer products markets. Furthermore, the results show that not all lead users perform well in virtual stock markets. Hence, virtual stock markets allow identifying lead users with superior abilities to forecast market success.","['nanOPINION LEADERSHIP', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ORIENTATION', 'INFORMATION', 'INNOVATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'MODEL']","['performance', 'information', 'knowledge']",experts selection
"This paper investigates how corruption in the institutional environment influences firms' decisions to obtain third-party certification to private management standards as signals of desirable conduct. We argue that policy-specific corruption erodes trust in government efforts to regulate firms' conduct, thus increasing the signaling value of private certifications and the likelihood of certification. However, widespread corruption in the general environment can extend distrust to private certification systems, which reduces the credibility and signaling value of private certifications, thus decreasing the likelihood that firms obtain certification. Our empirical results based on ISO 14001 environmental management system certification among 433 automotive plants in Mexico confirm these relationships. We discuss the implications of our findings for transaction cost economics, institutional theory, research, and practice.

"This paper examines contracting between a principal and an agent from the perspective of both social exchange theory and rational choice theory. Two experiments were conducted that tested competing predictions from the two theories. The first study examined effort decisions made by an agent under a series of contracts that varied in social context and compensation structure. The second experiment examined the negotiation of a compensation scheme between a principal and an agent and the agent's subsequent contract fulfillment, to test the mediating effects of verbal communication between parties on contracting and contract fulfillment. Both studies yielded results consistent with social exchange theory. Exchange theory appears to provide a better basis for deriving principles of organization design than rational choice.","['nanCEO PAY', 'COMPENSATION', 'RISK', 'PERFORMANCE', 'RECIPROCITY', 'TRUST', 'INCENTIVES', 'PSYCHOLOGY', 'CONTRACTS', 'BEHAVIOR']","['compensation', 'contracts']",communication
"Research Summary In this paper, we contribute to research on networks and innovation by distinguishing between instrumental and affective ties and assessing their impact on individual innovativeness. In particular, using original data from the corporate R&D laboratory of a global pharmaceutical company, we evaluate how a specific structural arrangement (i.e., belonging to a clique) affects inventors' innovative productivity. Our results show that both instrumental/knowledge-sharing cliques and affective/friendship cliques correlate positively with inventors' innovative productivity. However, we also observe that when inventors straddle knowledge-sharing and friendship cliques, their innovative productivity declines. Managerial Summary Firms competing in knowledge-intensive industries rely on the productivity of their inventors to develop innovations. Within these firms, inventors' innovative productivity is influenced by the people they interact with and by the benefits and costs associated with maintaining these relationships. We find that inventors' innovative productivity is enhanced by having strong and embedded relationships with their colleagues, regardless of these relationships being based on knowledge-sharing ties or friendship ties. However, when inventors are caught in between strong knowledge-sharing ties and strong friendship ties, their innovative productivity suffers, ultimately hampering the firm's innovative capabilities.","['affective ties', 'embedded triads', 'individual level', 'innovative performance', 'instrumental tiesKNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'SOCIAL NETWORKS', 'WEAK TIES', 'CREATIVITY', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETENCE', 'GENERATION', 'BROKERAGE', 'STRENGTH']","['affective ties', 'affective ties']",networks innovation affective ties friendship
"This study examines the relationship between CEO external directorate networks and CEO compensation. Drawing on previous research showing a link between executives' external networks, firm strategy, and performance, the study argues that executive external networks are strategically valuable to firms; thus, they should be reflected in executive compensation. The study further examines whether firm diversification, with its elevated demand for strategic resources, moderates the relationship between CEO external directorate networks and pay. Hypotheses are tested using a sample of 460 Fortune 1000 firms. Analyses reveal that the rewards to CEO external directorate networks are contingent upon the firm's level of diversification.

"Previous researchers have questioned whether the association between high-performance work systems (HPWS) and organizational performance indicates causality. Strategic human resource management theories, including the resource-based view of the firm and the behavioral perspective, have provided explanations linking human resource management practices to organizational performance. We add arguments based upon general systems theory to suggest a more complex relationship where performance provides feedback on HPWS in the form of information and resources. This feedback generates both the data and the slack resources needed to support an adaptive process of HPWS implementation. We test the causal associations between HPWS and performance using a large longitudinal data set with three time points. Findings showed that past HPWS positively contributes to later productivity as well as the reverse. The reciprocal relationship supports the need to extend strategic human resource management theory by considering productivity as an antecedent as well as an outcome of human resource management practices.","['strategic human resource management', 'high-performance work systems', 'causality', 'general systems theory', 'human resources', 'productivityHUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT', 'INDUSTRIAL-RELATIONS', 'MEASUREMENT ERROR', 'LONGITUDINAL DATA', 'HRM']","['strategic human resource management', 'strategic human resource management', 'strategic human resource management', 'strategic human resource management', 'high performance work systems', 'high performance work systems', 'high performance work systems', 'high performance work systems', 'causality', 'general systems theory', 'general systems theory', 'general systems theory', 'longitudinal data', 'longitudinal data']",high performance work systems view firm behavioral perspective systems slack resources
"Although customer complaints are a well-studied aspect of business, no study has measured the impact of actual complaints and recoveries on subsequent customer purchasing. The authors develop a customer base model to investigate the effectiveness of recovery in preventing customer churn. They calibrate it on panel data that track actual purchases, complaints, and recoveries for 20,000 new customers of an Internet and catalog retailer over 2.5 years. Complaints are associated with a substantial increase in the probability that the customer stops buying, but the size of the increase depends on prior customer experiences: prior purchases mitigate the effect, and their impact is long-lasting, whereas prior complaints exacerbate the effect, but their impact is short-lived. Thus, unless the customer leaves the company after a complaint, or a second failure occurs shortly after the first, the relationship quickly returns to normal. Recovery counters the effect of the complaint but, in almost all cases, does not entirely offset it. The authors use simulation to translate the results to financial impact and discuss implications for researchers and managers.","['complaints', 'complaint management', 'churn', 'failure', 'recoverySELF-GENERATED VALIDITY', 'SERVICE RECOVERY', 'SATISFACTION', 'IMPACT', 'BEHAVIOR', 'FAILURE', 'MODEL', 'EXPERIENCES', 'INTENTIONS', 'PARADOX']","['complaints', 'churn', 'failure', 'impact', 'failure', 'model', 'experiences']",complaints model simulation
"Building on the theoretical argument that a firm's ability to profit from social responsibility depends upon its stakeholder influence capacity (SIC), we bring together contrasting literatures on the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) to hypothesize that the CSP-CFP relationship is U-shaped. Our results support this hypothesis. We find that firms with low CSP have higher CFP than firms with moderate CSP, but firms with high CSP have the highest CFP. This supports the theoretical argument that SIC underlies the ability to transform social responsibility into profit.

"Despite increasing attention to the role of social ties in emerging economies, few studies have explicitly distinguished the differential roles of business versus political ties. Drawing on relational governance and institutional theories, this study offers a contingent view of business and political ties in China. The findings from a survey of 241 Chinese firms indicate that business ties have a stronger positive effect on performance than political ties, and both effects depend on institutional and market environments. Business ties are more beneficial when legal enforcement is inefficient and technology is changing rapidly, whereas political ties lead to greater performance when general government support is weak and technological turbulence is low. These findings indicate that firms operating in China should be cautious in their use of business and political ties and adapt their tie utilization to changing institutional and market environments.","['social ties', 'emerging economy', 'relational governance', 'institutional theory', 'institutional environment', 'guanxiMANAGERIAL TIES', 'EXECUTIVE INSIGHTS', 'SOCIAL-STRUCTURE', 'INNOVATION', 'GOVERNANCE', 'LEGITIMACY', 'ALLIANCES', 'STRATEGY', 'VENTURES', 'GUANXI']","['social ties', 'social ties', 'relational governance', 'relational governance', 'governance']",social ties
"Previous internationalization studies have focused on the entry modes employed by multinational firms but have not considered the contractual heterogeneity that underlies each mode. It is important to examine these contractual details, as the firm may be able to obtain some of the benefits typically associated with one entry mode while selecting another. In the case of international mergers and acquisitions (M&As), a key contractual variable is whether the parties agree to a performance-contingent payout structure, which can mitigate the risk of adverse selection. In this paper, we examine the antecedents of contingent payouts in the form of earnouts and stock payments. The results indicate that firms lacking international and domestic acquisition experience turn to contingent payouts when purchasing targets in high-tech and service industries. Firms tend to avoid contingent payouts in host countries with problems with investor protection and legal enforceability.

In contrast, relatively little research has examined the factors that might drive consumer preference for bundles versus individual items.

Through exploratory interviews and two laboratory experiments, the authors show that preference for a bundle is greater when bundle choice will reduce search effort than when it will not, particularly among consumers who are less motivated to process information.","['bundling', 'product bundles', 'search costs', 'perceived value', 'consumer choice', 'information processing', 'need for cognitionPRICE', 'INFORMATION', 'DECISION', 'MODEL', 'SERVICES', 'BEHAVIOR', 'CHOICE', 'TIME']","['bundling', 'information', 'choice']",prospect choice

Based on longitudinal data (2000-2008) from 772 publicly listed firms in Taiwan, the findings indicate that organizational slack significantly influences the internationalization processes. Specifically, firms with high organizational slack that have performance that falls below aspirations managers are more likely to exhibit (1) a rapid pace, (2) a wider scope, and (3) an irregular rhythm in their internationalization processes. In addition, we observed an interaction effect between performance feedback and different levels of slack on the internationalization processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"While research on conspicuous consumption has typically analyzed how people spend money on products that signal status, this article investigates conspicuous consumption in relation to time. The authors argue that a busy and overworked lifestyle, rather than a leisurely lifestyle, has become an aspirational status symbol. A series of studies shows that the positive inferences of status in response to busyness and lack of leisure time are driven by the perceptions that a busy person possesses desired human capital characteristics (e.g., competence and ambition) and is scarce and in demand in the job market. This research uncovers an alternative kind of conspicuous consumption that operates by shifting the focus from the preciousness and scarcity of goods to the preciousness and scarcity of individuals. Furthermore, the authors examine cultural values (perceived social mobility) and differences among cultures (North America vs. Europe) to demonstrate moderators and boundary conditions of the positive associations derived from signals of busyness.","['conspicuous consumption', 'time spending', 'status signaling', 'work versus leisure', 'social mobilitySOCIAL-STATUS', 'CULTURE', 'SIGNALS', 'BRAND', 'WOMEN', 'REDISTRIBUTION', 'PREFERENCES', 'INEQUALITY', 'HAPPINESS', 'CONSUMER']","['conspicuous consumption', 'conspicuous consumption', 'culture', 'signals']",conspicuous consumption time lifestyle
"Purpose - The article deals with issues such as the size of a purchasing group, the types of benefits aimed for, and the real beneficiaries of purchasing groups. Design/methodology/approach - The observations are based on the literature, as well as on interviews, mostly with Canadian and US health-care managers. Findings - Although often associated with the public sector, purchasing groups are also an alternative considered more and more by managers of the private sector. A purchasing group increases volume consolidation, making it possible to have only one negotiation, in order to increase the purchasing group members' power vis-a-vis that of its suppliers. However, a purchasing group also constitutes an additional link in the supply chain and its objectives could go contrary to those of some of its members. This is why organisations considering joining a purchasing group should analyse this option strategically, in order to assess correctly the potential long-term benefits. Originality/value - This article suggests key questions and an analytical framework to help managers assess the potential benefits and drawbacks of joining a purchase group.","['purchasing groups', 'procurement', 'structuresnan']","['purchasing groups', 'purchasing groups']",
"This paper examines the nature of the core capabilities of a firm, focusing in particular on their interaction with new product and process development projects. Two new concepts about core capabilities are explored here. First, while core capabilities are traditionally treated as clusters of distinct technical systems, skills, and managerial systems, these dimensions of capabilities are deeply rooted in values, which constitute an often overlooked but critical fourth dimension. Second, traditional core capabilities have a down side that inhibits innovation, here called core rigidities. Managers of new product and process development projects thus face a paradox: how to take advantage of core capabilities without being hampered by their dysfunctional flip side. Such projects play an important role in emerging strategies by highlighting the need for change and leading the way. Twenty case studies of new product and process development projects in five firms provide illustrative data.","['CORE CAPABILITIES', 'INNOVATION', 'NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTDISTINCTIVE COMPETENCE', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'STRATEGY', 'INDUSTRY', 'DESIGN']","['core capabilities', 'core capabilities', 'innovation', 'innovation']",firm innovation
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a validated measurement model and typology for chain digitisation maturity, defined as the degree of interorganisational collaboration through ICT. Design/methodology/approach - Through a literature (meta) study, 22 existing maturity models are found and analysed, on the basis of which an integrated framework is developed. This framework is subsequently applied to interorganisational collaboration within the Dutch retail sector (i.e. retailers and their wholesalers, manufacturers, customers, and trade organisations). The measurement model is tested by determining the chain digitisation level of 24 different retail sub-sectors (branches) through desk research, interviews, and surveys. Data are collected at the level of the branch, mainly through representatives of trade organisations. Findings - The framework (i.e. measurement model) appears to be applicable to describing the Dutch retail sector and comparing its branches, providing both expected and new insights. The typology supports the vision of the combination of two dimensions: the level of technology and the level of organisation. Research limitations/implications - The framework has been applied to the (Dutch) retail sector only. It seems suitable for application to other sectors as well. Practical implications - The empirical application provides an extended view of the current situation of the (Dutch) retail sector with regard to chain digitisation. On this basis, a roadmap can be derived to support the adoption and deployment of chain digitisation among retail organisations. Originality/value - The framework for chain digitisation and the derived typology are of value to the SCM research community, as they are specifically developed and tested at the level of interorganisational chains.","['Information systems', 'Digital storage', 'Retailers', 'Small to medium-sized enterprises', 'The NetherlandsSUPPLY CHAIN', 'INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY', 'INTEGRATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'BUSINESS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'NETWORK', 'MODEL']","['retailers', 'model']",chain digitisation interorganisational collaboration ict retailers level technology
"Although marketers increasingly rely upon cause-related marketing strategies to increase sales, controversy exists regarding whether a retailer should partner with causes offering high or low fit levels with its core business practices. The present investigation extends prior research by examining how retailer-cause fit affects consumer evaluations of retailers' cause-related marketing strategies. The results indicate that the effects of retailer-cause fit are moderated by consumer perceptions of the retailer's motive for engaging in cause-related marketing (Study 1), by the affinity that consumers hold for the social cause component of the campaign (Study 2), as well as by the interactive effects associated with the two moderators (Study 3).

"With the increasing popularity of visual-oriented social media platforms, the prevalence of visual brand-related User Generated Content (UGC) have increased. Monitoring such content is important as this visual brand-related UGC can have a large influence on a brand's image and hence provides useful opportunities to observe brand performance (e.g., monitoring trends and consumer segments). The current research discusses the application of computer vision for marketing practitioners and researchers and examines the usability of three different pre-trained ready-to-use computer vision models (i.e., YOLOV2, Google Cloud Vision, and Clarifai) to analyze visual brand-related UGC automatically. A 3-step approach was adopted in which 1) a database of 21,738 Instagram pictures related to 24 different brands was constructed, 2) the images were processed by the three different computer vision models, and 3) a label evaluation procedure was conducted with a sample of the labels (object names) outputted by the models. The results of the label evaluation procedure are quantitatively assessed and complemented with four concrete examples of how the output of computer vision can be used to analyze visual brand-related UGC. Results show that computer vision can yield various marketing insights. Moreover, we found that the three tested computer vision models differ in applicability. Google Cloud Vision is more accurate in object detection, whereas Clarifai provides more useful labels to interpret the portrayal of a brand. YOLOV2 did not prove to be useful to analyze visual brand-related UGC. Results and implications of the findings for marketers and marketing scholars will be discussed.

"In the context of online comparison shopping, the phenomenon of order effect and its impact has profound theoretical and practical significance, as many search engines and shopping portals offer paid placement and paid inclusion in search results. In this study, we investigate how order effects and other market competitive factors work together to attract consumers' attention to online vendors, which is manifested by the time spent on collecting more vendor information, and the probability of a vendor being included in a consumer's consideration set. We found that the effect of serial position of a vendor in a list is mediated by consumers' attention which in turn affects the probability of the vendor being accepted. (C) 2008 New York University.

"Past research on consumer price knowledge has varied considerably partly due to differences in how and when price knowledge is measured. This paper applies a multi-point, multi-measure approach to reconcile differences in past price knowledge research by examining systematic relationships between time of measurement and type of measures applied. Examination of consumer price knowledge before, during, and after store visit sheds light on what is measured at the individual points in time: episodic price knowledge and/or reference prices? With a between-subjects design interviewing 1,204 respondents, the authors investigate three price knowledge measures (price recall, price recognition, and deal spotting) demonstrating that these are hierarchically related. Results suggest that reference prices dominate before store visit, but also that episodic price knowledge, surprisingly, is still accessible at the store exit. These findings enable the authors to reconcile diverging results from past research, showing how consumer price knowledge evolves and suggesting that the vast majority of consumers learn about prices, whether consciously or unconsciously, during grocery shopping. Thus, when applying a multi-point, multi-measure approach, consumers appear to know more about prices than suggested by past research. Determinants of price knowledge are also examined and the results indicate that price knowledge builds up not only because of active search but also due to accidental exposure to prices and with low degrees of conscious processing. Implications for managers are discussed. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"According to dynamic capability theory, some firms are better able than others at altering their resource base by adding, reconfiguring, and deleting resources or competences. This study focuses on the first form of dynamic capability: the competence to build new competences. Two such second-order competences are studied: the ability to explore new markets and the ability to explore new technologies-referred to as marketing and R&D second-order competences, respectively. Using two wave panel data on a sample of U.S. public manufacturing firms, five organizational antecedents of these second-order competences are examined: willingness to cannibalize, constructive conflict, tolerance for failure, environmental scanning, and resource Slack. Willingness to cannibalize, constructive conflict, scanning, and slack have contemporaneous effects, while scanning also has a lagged effect and slack has a U-shaped lagged effect on marketing and R&D second-order competences.

"Consumers often find themselves challenged by the conflicting desires to seek uniqueness versus conformity, and thus seek some degree of balance. In a series of six studies we show that presenting each options' product-related information in a unique color, as opposed to all product related information presented in black-on-white, partially satiates the desire for uniqueness, thus amplifying the compromise effect. Consumers facing color presentation formats choose the middle, conforming option more often, yet perceive their choice as more unique. This color effect is not realized if each option's attributes are presented in different colors, but all options use a consistent color scheme, as is often the case in on-line retailing sites such as Amazon.com. Having to justify one's choice moderates the color effect. The practical take-away is that consumers' choices can be influenced by using unique colors to present option-related product information, a variable that is entirely independent of the options' performance characteristics. Two field studies confirm this finding, one using a plain background versus a colored background in a product display and the other using product containers that are either in plain white or wrapped in unique colors.

"Relationship marketing is a central and important tenet in marketing thought, and considerable research effort in the discipline has been devoted to examining various facets of relationship marketing, resulting in a large body of knowledge. In this study, the authors specifically focus on the international dimension of the relationship marketing literature and use citation and cocitation data to identify and unfold its intellectual foundations. The goal is to provide new and meaningful avenues for further research using the knowledge structure on which international relationship marketing stands. The examination of the literature spans more than 40 years, divided into three time periods that permit detection of longitudinal trends as well as meaningful visual representations of the cocitation data. Overall, the authors survey 29 key publications and identify 3,509 articles that include 230,684 citations, examining the data for 1972-1993, 1994-2003, and 2004-2013 to unfold research possibilities. Drawing on the analysis of emergent multidimensional scaling results, the authors discuss potential international relationship marketing research incorporating social relations and networking, new ventures, internationalization, trust and commitment, tacit knowledge, and cultural values.","['international relationship marketing', 'cocitation analysis', 'multidimensional scaling', 'intellectual foundationRELATIONSHIP QUALITY', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'COCITATION ANALYSIS', 'ENTRY MODE', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATION', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT', 'STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT', 'EXPORT PERFORMANCE', 'DEVELOPING-COUNTRY']","['international relationship marketing', 'international relationship marketing', 'international relationship marketing', 'multidimensional scaling', 'multidimensional scaling']",relationship marketing cocitation values
"The GLOBE study of national cultures identified nine dimensions of culture. These nine dimensions were measured in the form of societal practices (as things are) and societal values (as things should be). The correlations between practices and values for societies, surprisingly, were found to be significantly negative for seven dimensions. Apparently, people's values are contrary to their practices. A note, which appeared in a recent issue of this journal, proposes that these anomalous correlations result from diminishing marginal utility. The note argues that marginal utility theory applies to cultural dimensions, and that the GLOBE values measure societies' marginal preferences for most of the dimensions, rather than total preference weights. Through close analysis of the questionnaire items used by the GLOBE team, we show that this is not the case. We demonstrate that the GLOBE questions, as asked, do not elicit marginal preferences. In fact they elicit values, as claimed by GLOBE, but recognizing that values may well be shaped, in part, by existing practices. We call for further study into the GLOBE scores, as it is likely that different explanations apply to practices/values relationships across different dimensions.

"Purpose This paper responds to calls from the literature for research identifying the difference between the effect of internal agents and external agents, such as customers, suppliers and government on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). The paper also determines whether there is a dynamic or interactive relationship between the two types of agents. Design/methodology/approach Activity theory was used as the theoretical framework for understanding how internal and external agents affected both SSCM motivation and facilitation and possible interactions between the two. A cluster analysis identified how internal and external agents affected SSCM initiatives, interactions, the conditions under which this occurs and the mechanisms of this effect. Findings Internal and external agents differ in the type, sequence and diversity of their effect on SSCM. While external agents had both an SSCM motivating and facilitation effect, internal agents only had a facilitating effect. Customers were only a significant SSCM motivation in 35% of the cases. Government regulations had a dynamic effect, changing from motivation to facilitation as the SSCM initiative developed. External agent SSCM motivation and facilitation were more internalized in organizations which were more internationally oriented. Practical implications - Local institutional frameworks motivate and facilitate SSCM initiatives, while head office initiatives and international best practice agencies encourage an integrated combination of external agent motivation and facilitation and internal facilitation. Originality/value The findings extend the SSCM literature by identifying the processes of agent SSCM motivation and facilitation, the dynamic nature of agent SSCM effects and the mechanism through which externally motivated and facilitated SSCM becomes internalized.","['Sustainability', 'Supply-chain management', 'Cluster analysis', 'SCM practices', 'Agents', 'Activity theoryENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY', 'QUALITATIVE DATA', 'PUBLIC-SECTOR', 'MIXED-METHODS', 'GREEN', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PROCUREMENT', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'MOTIVATION']","['supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'cluster analysis', 'cluster analysis', 'agents', 'motivation']",supply chain management activity motivation facilitation
"Ideology is a core and contested concept in the social sciences, but also long deployed in management research to highlight the political, embedded and/or obscuring nature of ideas. Indeed, many would argue that management itself is inherently ideological in legitimating or privileging managerial interests and concealing other groups and ways of organizing. In the first systematic review of how ideology has been conceptualized in management studies, this paper explores its diverse and changing meanings in order to develop and sustain the concept. It is based on a heuristic review of 175 articles and 41 books published between 1956 and 2018. Further developing categories used in the social sciences around its role, we found views of ideology as: (1) domination; (2) legitimation; (3) interpretation; (4) integration; and (5) normative logic. In addition, emerging perspectives were identified where ideology was (6) an object of critique or (7) fantasy structuring social reality. We describe, illustrate and evaluate these often internally diverse and interrelated perspectives, as well as comparing them with sometimes competing notions within the management field, such as discourse, culture and legitimation. We also bring together the different approaches and argue for a pluralist, but not infinitely flexible, approach to the concept. In doing so, we identify research agendas for ideology within management and organization studies.","['nanCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL SYMBOLISM', 'LABOR PROCESS', 'DISCOURSE', 'BUSINESS', 'POLITICS', 'DIFFUSION', 'CRITIQUE', 'MARKETS', 'ELITE']","['discourse', 'critique']",ideology
"Outsourcing plays all important role for firms adopting new technologies. Although outsourcing provides access to a new, technology, it does not guarantee that a firm call subsequently integrate the technology with existing business processes and leverage it in the marketplace. This distinction, however, has rarely been made in the literature. In the context of business process enhancing technologies, this study builds oil the resource-based and knowledge-based views to study the impact of outsourcing on firm's subsequent performance in the market and their integrative capabilities, that is, a firm's capacity to use and assimilate a new technology with its business processes and build upon it. The study argues that greater reliance on outsourcing may reduce a firm's learning by doing, internal investment, and tacit knowledge applications, thereby impeding a firm's integrative capabilities and performance in the market. The study uses survey and archival data on banks' outsourcing strategies for Internet adoption to test for the performance consequences of outsourcing, which are found to be negative. However, the findings also show that outsourcing is less detrimental for firms with experience in prior related technology.

"As entrepreneurship research has matured, scholars have increasingly recognized that the formation of new ventures is commonly accomplished by teams as opposed to lone entrepreneurs. Over the past two decades, the upper echelons perspective has served as the primary lens for investigating new venture team functioning and performance. However, researchers have begun to move beyond the relationship between team characteristics and team outcomes, to explore intermediary mechanisms that more precisely explain how team inputs lead to team effectiveness. In this article we apply an inputs-mediators-outcomes framework, which has served as a foundation for teams research in organizational behavior over the past 50 years, to first organize and review prior work on new venture teams, and then to provide a roadmap for future research. By integrating the upper echelons approach from strategic management with the inputs-mediators-outcomes framework from organizational behavior, we clarify what is known about new venture teams and shed light on important issues that could help the field of entrepreneurship to develop a more comprehensive understanding of why some new venture teams, but not others, achieve successful outcomes.","['new venture teams', 'entrepreneurship', 'founding teams', 'top management teams', 'upper echelon', 'group processesTOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS', 'DISPOSITIONAL POSITIVE AFFECT', 'STRATEGIC DECISION-PROCESSES', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL TEAM', 'OPPORTUNITY RECOGNITION', 'CAPITALISTS EVALUATIONS', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY', 'SHARED LEADERSHIP', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'FOUNDING TEAMS']","['new venture teams', 'new venture teams', 'new venture teams', 'entrepreneurship', 'upper echelon', 'upper echelon']",upper echelons performance
"Market orientation is a foundation of marketing and is increasingly important in other fields, such as strategic management. Research in marketing has identified the characteristics of market-oriented organizations. However, how organizations change to become more market oriented has received less attention. In this article, the authors conduct an in-depth, longitudinal, multifirm investigation of firms that have successfully created a market orientation. Grounded by this in-depth understanding, they develop a theoretical model to explain how firms create a market orientation. The model identifies four path-dependent stages of change. In contrast to current conceptual izations, the authors find that creating a market orientation requires dramatic changes to an organization's culture and the creation of organizationally shared market understandings. The findings offer new insights into how organizations develop a greater market orientation, organizational change, and the nature of market orientation, including the role of intraorganizational power and organizational learning in creating and sustaining a market orientation.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'MODEL']",['model'],market orientation culture
"This paper examines performance effects of ownership concentration and two types of private equity investors (venture capitalists and business angels) in firms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO) in the United Kingdom and France. We expand and contextualize nascent understanding of multiple agency theory by examining heterogeneity of private equity investors and by suggesting that multiple agency relationships are affected by different institutional contexts. We employ a unique, hand-collected dataset of 224 matched IPOs (112 in each country). Controlling for the endogeneity of private equity investors' retained share ownership, we find support for the agency theory argument that concentrated ownership improves IPOs' performance. The research also shows that the two types of private equity investors have a differential impact on performance, and the legal institutions in a given count!), moderate this impact.

"Many cross-cultural researchers are concerned with factorial invariance; that is, with whether or not members of different cultures associate survey items, or similar measures, with similar constructs. Researchers usually test items for factorial invariance using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). CFA, however, poses certain problems that must be dealt with. Primary among them is standardization, the process that assigns units of measurement to the constructs (latent variables). Two standardization procedures and several minor variants have been reported in the literature, but using these procedures when testing for factorial invariance can lead to inaccurate results. In this paper we review basic theory, and propose an extension of Byrne, Shavelson, and Muthen's (1989) procedure for identifying non-invariant items. The extended procedure solves the standardization problem by performing a systematic comparison of all pairs of factor loadings across groups. A numerical example based upon a large published data set is presented to illustrate the utility of the new procedure, particularly with regard to partial factorial invariance.","['nanCONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS', 'CROSS-CULTURAL RESEARCH', 'MEASUREMENT EQUIVALENCE', 'SELF-CONCEPT', 'VALIDITY', 'MODELS', 'ISSUES']","['cross cultural research', 'cross cultural research', 'cross cultural research']",standardization

"The strategic management field has derived many of its theoretical concepts from other social science disciplines including economics, psychology, and sociology. Industrial organization (IO) economics and the structure-conduct-performance paradigm, in particular, provided many of the building blocks upon which strategy formulation was constructed (Barney, 1986,- Harrigan, 1981; Porter, 1981). However, some researchers are now questioning this transfer of theory from IO economics to Strategic Management (Barney, 1986; Conner, 1991; Hirsch & Friedman, 1986; Rumelt, 1984).","['nanCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'GENERIC STRATEGIES', 'INDUSTRY', 'FIRM', 'BUSINESS', 'BARRIERS', 'CONTEXT', 'PORTER', 'VIEW', 'LINE']","['porter', 'line']",performance
"Self-tracking technologies (STTs) in the form of smart devices and mobile applications enable consumers to monitor, analyze, and interpret personal performance data on health and physical or financial well-being. As a result of self-tracking, consumers are not only expected to check their personal performance more actively but also to implement service professionals' advice to improve their well-being more accurately. Despite the growing popularity of STTs, empirical evidence on the extent to which STT use enhances advice compliance remains scant. A field experiment with 538 participants in a health-care setting suggests that STT use does not increase advice compliance per se. Rather, the effectiveness of STTs depends on consumers' self-efficacy. For consumers low in self-efficacy, STT use can even undermine advice compliance. A lab experiment with 831 participants replicates and generalizes the findings to a nonmedical professional service (i.e., fitness training). As assessments of self-efficacy might be difficult in practice, service providers in health care can use consumers' body mass index as an easy-to-measure proxy to predict STT effectiveness. Finally, the lab experiment also identifies perceived empowerment and personalization as psychological mechanisms mediating the influence of STT use on advice compliance.","['self-tracking technology', 'smart devices', 'advice compliance', 'self-efficacy', 'Quantified Self', 'technology adoption', 'field experimentBODY-MASS INDEX', 'HEALTH-CARE', 'BEHAVIORAL INTENTIONS', 'PLANNED BEHAVIOR', 'REASONED ACTION', 'SERVICE', 'EFFICACY', 'DETERMINANTS', 'EMPOWERMENT', 'ADHERENCE']","['smart devices', 'smart devices', 'advice compliance', 'advice compliance', 'self efficacy', 'self efficacy', 'health care', 'health care', 'service', 'efficacy', 'empowerment']",self tracking performance advice compliance self efficacy empowerment
"Due to the increasing globalization of businesses, new ideas for innovation need to be disseminated rapidly both within and across different departments and divisions. Frequently, ideas and information are dispersed over globally distributed organizations or team members. As a result, the exchange of knowledge has become not only very important for innovation but also highly complex. To facilitate this knowledge exchange, electronically mediated interactions are growing rapidly, replacing traditional face-to-face communications. However, literature provides contradicting results regarding the effectiveness of computer-mediated communication (CMC) versus face-to-face communication. This study attempts to reconcile differences in the literature on the benefits of CMC technologies and co-location. Focusing on knowledge dissemination in technology development processes in high-technology firms, the study investigates the relative impact of CMC technologies and co-location of research and development (R&D) staff, as well as the mutual interaction between them. The present article hypothesizes that CMC technologies and co-location of R&D staff have a positive impact on knowledge dissemination. Further, it is hypothesized that it is more favorable to co-locate R&D staff than to invest in CMC technologies and that the effects of co-location and CMC interact negatively. These hypotheses are tested using empirical data collected from 277 high-technology firms in the United States, and the results are generalized by conducting the same test on data from 125 high-technology firms in the Netherlands. Tests are conducted in a real-world setting, differing from previous comparative studies that mainly used laboratory experiments. Empirical results support the main effects of CMC technologies and co-location of R&D staff on knowledge dissemination. Other empirical results contradict conventional wisdom. Investing in CMC technologies is found to be favorable over co-locating R&D staff for knowledge dissemination. Moreover, the two communication channels strengthen each other. The discussion section presents the contours of a firm-level theory on communication infrastructures and knowledge dissemination, focusing on the scope and the heterogeneity of knowledge dissemination, which may explain these initially surprising results. From the arguments it follows that the choice for investment in eo-location or CMC technologies depends on the scope of knowledge dissemination that has to be facilitated. Furthermore, the conclusion is made that effective knowledge dissemination requires a balanced investment in co-location and information technologies to be able to deal with the heterogeneous but interdependent types of knowledge dissemination.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION', 'FACE-TO-FACE', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES', 'WEAK TIES', 'STRATEGY', 'ORGANIZATION', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'PERFORMANCE']","['computer mediated communication', 'computer mediated communication', 'computer mediated communication', 'face to face', 'face to face', 'face to face', 'information technologies', 'information technologies', 'organization']",organizations computer mediated communication
"This article provides a conceptual model that explains how the coevolution of organizational knowledge, capabilities, and products over long time spans can result in competitive advantage through innovation and strategic linkage of products at a point in time and over time. At the heart of the model are sequences of products within and across markets, supported by an underlying system of knowledge and systems of learning. This dynamic model brings the importance of the products themselves, supported by vertical chains of activities, into the analysis of resource and knowledge-based competitive advantage. The model also suggests that we can think about the evolution of firms, and by implication the evolution of industries, not only in terms of knowledge and capabilities, but also in terms of vertical chains and products. Short company histories illustrate the workings of the model.

"This article examines the link between recovery time and customer compensation expectations for service failures that cannot be immediately redressed. First, we show that the relationship between recovery time and compensation expectations is nonlinear. Initially, in a recovery time zone of tolerance, compensation expectations do not increase. Beyond this zone, the relationship follows an inverted U-shape, such that compensation expectations first increase but decrease in the long run. Second, our results show that long recovery times are accompanied by additional negative effects, including lower satisfaction with the recovery and negative word of mouth, so postponing service recovery represents a poor option. Third, relationship strength functions as a moderator. First-time customers expect higher compensation earlier; relational customers display a recovery time zone of tolerance but claim considerably higher compensations afterwards. Fourth, communication initiatives like the separate provision of status updates or an explanation may limit increases in compensation expectations over time. Still, their joint usage creates a too-much-of-a-good-thing effect, suggesting that if the usage of communication initiatives is taken too far it may lead to negative outcomes such as increasing compensation expectations.","['Service recovery', 'Customer relationships', 'Service failure', 'Customer betrayal', 'Customer anger', 'Explanation', 'Equity theory', 'Complaint status updatesWORD-OF-MOUTH', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'PERCEIVED JUSTICE', 'COMPENSATION', 'FAILURE', 'LOYALTY', 'IMPACT']","['service recovery', 'service recovery', 'service failure', 'service failure', 'explanation', 'compensation', 'failure']",service failures satisfaction word of
"P>This study examines the downfall of the permanent employment tradition in South Korean manufacturing organizations in the aftermath of the 1997 East Asian economic crisis. We explore whether organizations abandon their traditional institutionalized practices under discontinuous environmental change or despite the change continue these time-honoured practices. We examine both the organizational factors that inhibit lay-offs and performance indicators that trigger organizations to re-evaluate their lifetime employment practices under drastic environmental upheaval. We test our hypotheses on 574 Korean manufacturing organizations and find that under discontinuous change: (1) economic and institutional factors simultaneously apply opposite forces on organizational actions; (2) organizational factors such as poor performance on productivity and export create a need for headcount reductions while factors such as size, domestic ownership, government support, and unionization create social and institutional pressures that inhibit downsizing; and (3) prior experience with downsizing moderates the relationship between institutional factors and further downsizing.","['nanSTRATEGIC CHANGE', 'LAYOFF ANNOUNCEMENTS', 'UNITED-STATES', 'FIRM SIZE', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'DETERMINANTS']",['performance'],performance
"In two studies, we develop and test theory about the relationship between speaking up, one type of organizational citizenship behavior, and unit performance by accounting for where employee voice is flowing. Results from a qualitative study of managers and professionals across a variety of industries suggest that voice to targets at different formal power levels (peers or superiors) and locations in the organization (inside or outside a focal unit) differs systematically in terms of its usefulness in generating actions to a unit's benefit on the issues raised and in the likely information value of the ideas expressed. We then theorize how distinct voice flows should be differentially related to unit performance based on these core characteristics and test our hypotheses using time-lagged field data from 801 employees and their managers in 93 units across nine North American credit unions. Results demonstrate that voice flows are positively related to a unit's effectiveness when they are targeted at the focal leader of that unitwho should be able to take actionwhether from that leader's own subordinates or those in other units, and negatively related to a unit's effectiveness when they are targeted at coworkers who have little power to effect change. Together, these studies provide a structural framework for studying the nature and impact of multiple voice flows, some along formal reporting lines and others that reflect the informal communication structure within organizations. This research demonstrates that understanding the potential performance benefits and costs of voice for leaders and their units requires attention to the structure and complexity of multiple voice flows rather than to an undifferentiated amount of voice.","['employee voice', 'lateral voice', 'voice network', 'communication structure', 'organizational citizenship behavior', 'credit unionsORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIORS', 'EXTRA-ROLE BEHAVIORS', 'SOCIAL-INFLUENCE', 'ADVICE NETWORKS', 'MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'WORK GROUPS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SPEAKING', 'LEVEL', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['employee voice', 'employee voice', 'communication structure', 'communication structure', 'organizational citizenship behavior', 'organizational citizenship behavior', 'organizational citizenship behavior', 'performance', 'speaking', 'level']",speaking power framework
"This article investigates the role of contextual cues in the evaluation of a service failure. Empirical data demonstrates that although discrimination is a factor in the evaluation of a service failure for black (vs. white) customers, contextual cues also play a role in the evaluation of the encounter. When a black customer experiences a service failure, the failure will be evaluated more severely when no other black customers are present. In addition, the context of the event differentially affects the negative emotions generated by the service failure and results in racially driven differences in the amount of remuneration perceived as necessary to successfully recover from the failure. The implication is that when serving customers, the race of both the customer and other customers can provide service providers with information relative to the appropriate service recovery effort to implement.","['Service failure', 'Service recovery', 'Discrimination', 'Context effectsCONSUMPTION EMOTIONS', 'CUSTOMERS', 'IMPACT', 'DISTINCTIVENESS', 'ETHNICITY', 'SATISFACTION', 'ANGER']","['service failure', 'service failure', 'service recovery', 'service recovery', 'discrimination', 'customers']",service failure discrimination
"In this paper, we study to what extent inconsistent feedback signals about performance affect firm adaptive behavior in terms of changes made to research-and-development (R&D) investments. We argue that inconsistency in performance feedbackbased on discrepancies between two distinct performance signals-affects the degree to which such investments will be changed. Our aim is to show that accounting for inconsistent performance feedback is necessary as predictions for the direction of change in R&D investments based on the individual performance feedback signals are contradictory. Furthermore, we contribute by proposing a holistic consideration mechanism as an alternative to the selective attention mechanism previously applied to inconsistent performance feedback. Our findings show that the impact of inconsistency depends on the exact configuration of the underlying performance feedback signal discrepancies. While consistently negative performance feedback signals would amplify their impact in stimulating increased R&D investments, inconsistent performance feedback signals created more nuanced effects. Having lower performance compared to an industry-based peer groupdespite doing well compared to the previous yearmade firms decrease their R&D investments. For the opposite case of inconsistent performance feedback, we did not find an effect on change in R&D investments. These findings support to a degree our contention that explaining the effects of inconsistent performance feedback requires a holistic consideration theoretical mechanism instead of one involving selective attention. In sum, these findings suggest future research should take into account the differences between distinct instances of inconsistent performance feedback.","['performance feedback', 'inconsistency', 'behavioral theory of the firm', 'R&DBEHAVIORAL-THEORY', 'DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE', 'ASPIRATION-PERFORMANCE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'SEARCH', 'MODEL', 'FIRM', 'PERSISTENCE', 'DETERMINANTS', 'INNOVATIONS']","['performance feedback', 'performance feedback', 'inconsistency', 'search', 'firm']",feedback selective attention

"This research examines the effects of two key relational resources in relationships between retailers and national brand manufacturers. We introduce the new concept of trade equity, defined here as the value that accrues to a firm from being known in a trading network as a trustworthy trading partner, to explore the relational resources that are inherent in a firm's ties with trading partners. We consider brand equity to represent relational resources that are located in a firm's relational ties with end consumers. Based on data collected in a survey of 797 home appliance retailers, results show that a manufacturer's trade equity and brand equity have differential effects on the retailer's dependence and commitment to the manufacturer. Findings show that a manufacturer's brand equity strengthens the effect of its trade equity on the retailer's dependence and weakens the effect on the retailer's commitment.

"Multinational corporations (MNCs) are adopting increasingly diverse and complex marketing channels to sell their products worldwide. They strive to manage channels that confront diverse demands from headquarters, foreign subsidiaries, and local partners as well as complex market environments. Because extant research on MNCs' marketing channels is sparse, the authors propose an organizing framework to spur and guide research on MNC channel management. As a meta-theory that integrates economic and social elements of MNC channel management, the political economy perspective is used to propose two testable frameworks pertaining to determinants of (1) MNC marketing channel structures and processes and (2) MNC marketing channel outcomes. Building on these frameworks, the authors advance a research agenda to test substantive relationships, elaborate new constructs, and illustrate newcontexts pertaining toMNCmarketing channels. A set of propositions illustrates the applicability of these conceptual frameworks.","['multinational corporations', 'distribution channels', 'international business', 'interfirm relationships', 'headquarters-subsidiary relationshipsENTRY-MODE CHOICE', 'KNOWLEDGE FLOWS', 'HEADQUARTERS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'FIRM', 'SUBSIDIARIES', 'MNC', 'INTEGRATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FRAMEWORK']","['multinational corporations', 'multinational corporations', 'headquarters', 'subsidiaries', 'mnc', 'framework']",channel management
"Faced with the complexities of managing new product development most of us would welcome the support of a computer-based system that captures the knowledge and the reasoning capabilities of experts in our field. Considerable effort has been focused on the design and development of expert systems for applications such as new product management. However, design aid development are only two steps on the path to successful implementation of a useful expert system. A rigorous validation process is essential for ensuring that the expert system performs as intended. Using the INNOVATOR expert system as an example, Sundaresan Ram and Sudha Ram propose and test a framework for validating expert systems designed for new product management. The proposed validation framework considers three aspects of the expert system: its knowledge acquisition methodology, its performance, and its utility. Validation of an expert system's knowledge acquisition methodology involves assessment of the knowledge sources used, the criteria for selecting human experts, and the methods used for knowledge acquisition. Using multiple sources improves the likelihood that the expert system will capture the necessary core knowledge. Similarly, selection of the experts who are to supply the knowledge used by the expert system should be based on reliable measures of new product expertise rather than ad hoc measures. The system's performance is evaluated through formal tests of the accuracy and the completeness of the knowledge base, the consistency and the accuracy of the decisions made by the system, and the reasoning process by which the system reaches its decisions. Such tests may involve direct examination of the system by experts, and Turing tests, which compare both the recommendations and the reasoning process of the system with those of selected experts. Both types of tests may involve experts from whom knowledge was acquired during the development of the system as well as experts who were not involved in the design and development of the system. Assessment of an expert system's utility focuses on user perceptions of system performance and utility as well as the design of the user interface. First, end-users must evaluate the relevance of the chosen problem domain. In other words, the validation process must verify that the expert system addresses an important problem that requires decision support tools. Second, the expert system must provide a logical, systematic approach to solving the problem. Finally, the expert system must provide a consistent intuitive user interface.","['nanKNOWLEDGE-ACQUISITION', 'DECISION CALCULUS', 'JUDGMENT', 'SUCCESS', 'FAILURE', 'MODELS']",['success'],management acquisition
"In research on sexual harassment, authors have given little attention to sexual harassers. We present an actor-focused model of sexual harassment interactions. In the model, which is based on interpersonal aggression research, we frame sexual harassment as one form of behavior an actor might choose for pursuing valued goals. The model is interactive, in that we discuss the effects of sexually harassing actions on the target's perceptions, motives, and behavioral response choice. We also provide propositions to guide future research.","['nanATTRIBUTION THEORY', 'PERSUASION SCHEMA', 'RESPONSES', 'WOMEN', 'WORKPLACE', 'WORK', 'RESPONSIBILITY', 'GENDER', 'MEN', 'DISENGAGEMENT']",['men'],aggression
"This study challenges the implicit assumption of homogeneity in national institutional environments made in past studies of firm performance persistence. We propose that home-country institutions matter. We focus on the impact of formal institutions in the product, financial, and labor markets, arguing that they affect the size of pools of exchange partners and the types of exchanges allowed and condoned. Ultimately, these restrictions affect competitive intensity among firms, and firm performance persistence. Using data for over 10,000 firms from 33 countries over a 10-year time frame, we show that antitrust law strength, a product market institution designed to prevent collusion among firms, is associated with decreases in performance persistence. Unskilled labor market flexibility, a labor market institution that reduces legal constraints imposed on residual claimants (managers and owners) to take necessary actions to maintain or enhance profitability, is associated with increases in performance persistence. Product liability law effectiveness, another product market institution, and corporate control market development, a financial market institution, are positively associated with performance persistence only in the case of MNEs. The two remaining financial and labor market institutions, public equity market development (respectively skilled labor market availability) have a positive (respectively negative) impact for domestic firms only.

"Considering the importance of management education for society and the pedagogical inadequacies that pose a threat to academic institutions, this article develops an exploratory approach for evaluating and monitoring the quality of management education within an Ibero-American context. Latin American countries and Spain tend to think of themselves as an Ibero-American region, so the overview of key issues in management education in this article is pertinent to the entire region. The data is important to policymakers who wish to enhance the quality of higher education, since well-trained managers contribute to successful business strategies and superior organizational performance. Unfortunately, there is almost no empirical work available on the performance and effectiveness of higher education in Ibero-American countries. Our study helps bridge that gap by providing useful data for evaluating and reflecting upon some of the variables associated with management education in a sample of Ibero-American universities.

"Although there is significant evidence that customer satisfaction is an important driver of firm profitability, extant literature has largely neglected two intermediate outcomes of customer satisfaction, namely, a firm's advertising and promotion efficiency and its human capital performance. On the basis of longitudinal analyses of large-scale secondary data from multiple sources, the authors find that customer satisfaction boosts the efficiency of future advertising and promotion investments. This finding can be explained by the possibility that customer satisfaction generates free word-of-mouth advertising and saves subsequent marketing costs. In addition, customer satisfaction has a positive influence on a company's excellence in human capital (employee talent and manager superiority). This finding is highly novel, indicating that human resources managers should have a strong interest in customer satisfaction as well. Finally, the authors investigate the moderating influence of market concentration on both relationships. The uncovered results have important implications for marketers in their dialogue with financial executives and human resources managers.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'WORD-OF-MOUTH', 'CONSUMER SATISFACTION', 'SATISFIED CUSTOMERS', 'PERCEIVED RISK', 'DYNAMIC-MODEL', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'LOYALTY', 'IMPACT']","['word of mouth', 'word of mouth', 'word of mouth']",customer satisfaction advertising promotion word of mouth

We theorize that endemic innovations native to one population spread to other populations through two distinct forms of contagion. We test this argument by observing information technology firms' adoption of corporate venture capital programs. Results suggest that geographic proximity triggers cross-population contagion, that within-population contagion arises from different causal mechanisms, and that firms maintaining close cross-population ties pay less attention to the actions taken and outcomes experienced by other firms within their own industry.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'DIFFUSION', 'INNOVATION', 'NETWORKS', 'STRATEGY', 'FIRMS', 'ISOMORPHISM', 'SPILLOVERS', 'GOVERNANCE', 'ADOPTION']","['innovation', 'firms', 'adoption']",
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of perceived relational justice on the relationship between key customer categorization and performance of small food and drink producers in supermarket supply chains. Design/methodology/approach Survey data are derived from a sample of (small-scale) suppliers of local and regional food to a large British supermarket. Partial least squares regression analysis was used to test a conceptual framework, which positions relational justice as a mediator in the relationship between key customer categorization and supplier performance, moderated by the length of the relationship. Findings The findings reveal that small suppliers who perceive their treatment by their key customers as fair tend to achieve higher business performance, which supports the hypothesized mediating role of relational justice on supplier performance. However, this research found no evidence to support the hypothesis that this role is moderated by the length of the relationship between the supplier and buyer. Originality/value This paper makes a novel empirical contribution, focusing on performance outcomes for small-scale suppliers in a highly competitive environment (fast-moving consumer goods) with customers (supermarkets) who have significant market power. Accordingly, the paper shows that the way supermarket buyers treat their suppliers matters more for the performance of their suppliers than the very fact that they are key customers.","['UK', 'Supply-chain management', 'Supermarkets', 'Company performance', 'Food industry', 'Customer relationship managementKEY ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT', 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE', 'SOCIAL-EXCHANGE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE', 'POWER', 'BEHAVIOR', 'TRUST', 'BUYER', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'INTEGRATION']","['supermarkets', 'power', 'buyer']",categorization
"Prior research on interorganizational trust (IOT) has drawn on multiple theories across disciplines, resulting in mixed findings. This meta-analysis combines the three major theories of IOT, namely, transaction cost economics, social embeddedness theory, and resource dependence theory, to retheorize about these IOT relationships. Specifically, we consolidate 168 tests of IOT across theories and corroborate the additive predictive validity of each of the three theories and their combined explanations on IOT development. In particular, by combining IOT theories, we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between relationship duration and IOT; we also find an intertemporal link among the three IOT theories, and relationship duration as the spanning factor functions to moderate the IOT relationships across theories. These findings serve to reconcile prior conflicting findings and shed new light on IOT development. We conclude our meta-analysis by providing directions for future research.","['trust', 'transaction cost economics', 'social embeddedness theory', 'resource dependence theory', 'relationship duration', 'meta-analysisFAMILIARITY BREED TRUST', 'COGNITION-BASED TRUST', 'DARK SIDE', 'SOCIAL-STRUCTURE', 'GOVERNANCE', 'DETERMINANTS', 'EXCHANGE', 'OPPORTUNISM', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'COOPERATION']","['trust', 'transaction cost economics', 'transaction cost economics', 'transaction cost economics', 'social embeddedness theory', 'social embeddedness theory', 'social embeddedness theory', 'resource dependence theory', 'resource dependence theory', 'resource dependence theory', 'relationship duration', 'relationship duration']",interorganizational trust iot meta analysis transaction cost iot
"Machine-age technologies, including automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence, are profoundly expanding the variety of service interfaces and therefore the possible ways that customers and firms can interact across customer journeys. This expansion challenges service firms' capabilities to deliver coherent streams of interactions for effective customer engagement. This article develops a conceptual framework of firm capabilities that enable firms to operate with one voice to deliver seamless, harmonious, and reliable interactions across diverse interfaces in a customer journey. The proposed framework integrates three themes: (1) service interaction space to capture the interrelationship among devices, interfaces, interactions, and journeys; (2) learning and coordination as core capabilities for generating and using intelligence, respectively, to enhance customer engagement in subsequent interactions; and (3) one-voice strategy to configure learning and coordination capabilities in combinations that meet conditions of fitness and equifinality for effective customer engagement.

"Despite increasing scholarly attention on digital transformation, there are only limited micro-level insights into how incumbent firms organize and manage their digital transformation efforts on a daily basis. Through a longitudinal, exploratory qualitative case study of a large firm, this article investigates how organizational members respond to an ambidextrous organizing model designed to accelerate digital innovations. The firm relied on a hybrid model of separation and integration to organize and manage its digital transformation efforts. This study unfolds the implications and consequences of such a model at the micro-level. By applying a paradox lens, it shows how the coping actions of organizational members affected the digital transformation. The article illustrates how the hybrid organizing model led to the emergence of three paradoxes at the organizational level (paradoxes of organizing, attention, and knowledge sharing) that organizational members had to cope with. It shows how organizational members, through their coping with these paradoxes, indirectly affected the organizing model by altering its original design; and how the management, influenced by these learnings, subsequently adapted the model to enable a better sustainability over time. Overall, the findings show and explain why organizing for digital transformation is a particularly complex and paradoxical endeavor. They also provide important insights to managers and organizational developers, helping them to become aware of possible tensions in their organizing efforts as well as of coping strategies and practices to tackle these tensions. Finally, the article suggests different paths for further research in digital transformation and digital innovation from a micro-level perspective.","['nanMEDIATING ROLE', 'AUDI AG', 'INNOVATION', 'AMBIDEXTERITY', 'EXPLORATION', 'EXPLOITATION', 'DIFFERENTIATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'INTEGRATION', 'BUSINESS']","['innovation', 'perspective', 'integration']",transformation integration paradox
"The valuation of extension rights is critical for entertainment brands such as bestseller books. Building on brand extension research, we argue that accounting for the reciprocal spillover effect (i.e., the influence of an extension product on a parent brand) is important for determining the value of extension rights. We develop a contingency model of the reciprocal spillover effect for category extensions of entertainment products that are characterized by short life cycles and satiation effects. In the discussion of moderating factors, we pay particular attention to the new concept of backward integration, which accounts for the reaction of a parent to the introduction of an extension. Using data from all 446 literature adaptations produced for the big screen and theatrically released in North American theaters between 1998 and 2006, we provide evidence that extension success and marketing support impact the sales of the parent book and for several postulated moderating effects, including those of backward integration. Through simulation analyses, we demonstrate how considering the reciprocal effect in the managerial decision-making process can help entertainment managers to avoid biased estimations of category extension rights.","['Brand extension', 'Reciprocal spillover effect', 'Entertainment', 'Bestsellers', 'Motion picturesWORD-OF-MOUTH', 'EXTENSIONS', 'ATTITUDE', 'SUCCESS', 'SALES']","['brand extension', 'brand extension', 'reciprocal spillover effect', 'reciprocal spillover effect', 'reciprocal spillover effect', 'entertainment', 'extensions', 'success', 'sales']",extension rights brand extension backward integration category extension rights

The KBE is the dominant post-industrial economic development paradigm that emerged in the 1980s, with an emphasis on the role of knowledge creation and distribution as the primary driver in the process of economic growth, the distribution of income, the growing importance of knowledge-based networks among firms, and the interface between government business and citizens in the advanced economies. Recent empirical evidence on rates of return, geographic spillovers, and the internationalization of knowledge flows are discussed in relation to the theoretical foundations of the KBE.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'PATENTS', 'SPILLOVERS', 'RETURNS', 'MODELS']",['spillovers'],
"This paper offers a property rights theoretical interpretation of the ownership redirection hypothesis advanced by Oxenfeldt and Kelly [Oxenfeldt, Alfred R. and Kelly, Anthony O. (1968). Will Successful Franchise Systems Ultimately Become Wholly-owned Chains?, Journal of Retailing, 44, 69-83]. In a nutshell, couched in resource dependence theory, the ownership redirection hypothesis argues that successful franchise systems will eventually become corporate owned systems because of the reacquisition of franchisee units by the more powerful, and resource-flush franchisors. We argue that the structure and dynamics of ownership patterns in franchising networks depends on the contractibility of the franchisor's system-specific assets and the contractibility of the franchisee's local market assets. Under the property rights view, ownership redirection will result from an increase in the contractibility of the franchisee's local market assets (local market information, financial resources, and managerial capabilities) and the resultant increase of the franchisor's bargaining power during the contract period. We extend the franchise literature by arguing that informational, financial and managerial resource constraints are only relevant for the change of ownership structure if they are noncontractible. This hypothesis is evaluated using data collected from the Austrian franchise sector. The empirical results are largely supportive of the hypothesis. (c) 2006 New York University.

This note addresses these gaps by reconceptualizing CE as an attitude construct consisting of three dimensions: (1) affective reaction, (2) cognitive bias and (3) behavioral preference. A revised CE scale (CES) is developed and tested using two empirical studies with adult consumers from four different countries (China, India, UK and USA), showing that CES is a reliable, valid and cross-culturally invariant scale and it explains greater variance than the CETSCALE and other similar scales, in customer evaluations and behavioral intentions for a wide range of products and services.","['consumer ethnocentrism', 'CETSCALE', 'animosity', 'patriotism', 'internationalism', 'cosmopolitanismCOUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN', 'FOREIGN PRODUCTS', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'ATTITUDES', 'ANIMOSITY', 'VALIDITY', 'IMPACT', 'BRAND']","['consumer ethnocentrism', 'consumer ethnocentrism', 'cetscale', 'validity']",consumer ethnocentrism cognitive bias behavioral preference
"Motivation research distinguishes two types of goals: ( a) ideals, which relate to people's hopes, wishes, and aspirations, and (b) oughts, which relate to people's duties, obligations, and responsibilities. We propose that, in persuasion, the accessibility of ideals increases consumers' reliance on their subjective affective responses to the ad relative to the substance of the message, whereas the accessibility of oughts increases consumers' reliance on the substance of the message relative to their subjective affective responses. This phenomenon is accompanied by a relative change in the perceived diagnosticity of the two types of information under accessible ideals versus oughts - a change that can be related to the distinct modes of self-regulation that ideals and oughts trigger. The phenomenon appears to be unrelated to the kind of change in depth-of-processing posited by the Elaboration Likelihood Model and the Heuristic-Systematic Model.","['nanREGULATORY FOCUS', 'PERIPHERAL ROUTES', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'SELF', 'PREVENTION', 'PROMOTION', 'JUDGMENT', 'MOOD', 'DISCREPANCY', 'UNCERTAINTY']",['self'],persuasion self systematic
"Purpose This paper aims to investigate how blockchain has moved beyond cryptocurrencies and is being deployed to enhance visibility and trust in supply chains, their limitations and potential impact. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative analysis are undertaken via case studies drawn from food companies using semi-structured interviews. Findings Blockchain is demonstrated as an enabler of visibility in supply chains. Applications at scale are most likely for products where the end consumer is prepared to pay the premium currently required to fund the technology, e.g. baby food. Challenges remain in four areas: trust of the technology, human error and fraud at the boundaries, governance, consumer data access and willingness to pay. Research limitations/implications The paper shows that blockchain can be utilised as part of a system generating visibility and trust in supply chains. Research directs academic attention to issues that remain to be addressed. The challenges pertaining to the technology itself we believe to be generalisable; those specific to the food industry may not hold elsewhere. Practical implications From live case studies, we provide empirical evidence that blockchain provides visibility of exchanges and reliable data in fully digitised supply chains. This provides provenance and guards against counterfeit goods. However, firms will need to work to gain consumer buy-in for the technology following repeated past claims of trustworthiness.

"To successfully satisfy large customers and meet financial objectives, dedicated sales teams need to manage two boundaries: a boundary within the selling firm and one with the customer organization. However, little is known about the process of managing these multiple boundaries. This study integrates job demands-resource theory with research on key account management and sales teams to examine (1) the main effect of customer boundary spanning on perceived customer satisfaction and team performance and (2) the moderating role of within-firm coordination activities at three levels: top management, cross-functional, and within-team. An empirical test of the model with data from 167 sales teams finds that the interaction between customer boundary spanning and within-firm coordination activities has opposite effects on perceived customer satisfaction and team performance outcomes.

"To gain attention and build support for new categories, market entrepreneurs often define a new category through its contrast with related, established offerings. Existing research has largely focused on the benefits of this oppositional categorical positioning. In this study, we explore how this strategy might be a double-edged sword. Through a longitudinal inductive study of the e-cigarette category in the U.S. (2007-2017), we develop theory on the risks of associating with an already established category. In our empirical case, we document how value-based distinctions between cigarettes and e-cigarettes became eroded and the e-cigarette category grew increasingly stigmatized. We then propose several mechanisms through which the symbolic and social boundaries between a new and an established category can weaken and the stigma associated with an existing category can become diffused, intensified, and generalized-both across organizational features and across organizations in the new category. This case allows us to investigate the processes by which strategies to legitimize categories may backfire and to consider the role that a diverse set of core and peripheral stakeholders-who enter the market with pre-existing knowledge and motivations-play in category stigmatization processes.","['stigma', 'new organizational forms', 'categories', 'economic sociologyELECTRONIC CIGARETTES', 'ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS', 'GENERAL-THEORY', 'IDENTITY', 'MOVEMENT', 'MARKET', 'LEGITIMACY', 'PRODUCT', 'BOUNDARIES', 'STRATEGIES']","['stigma', 'categories', 'market', 'boundaries', 'strategies']",e cigarette category stigmatization

"It is often assumed that directors with human capital such as prior management experience or independence from the company are the most influential board members. By contrast, in a survey of all the board members in 14 companies we found that ties to others in a network of strong ties among those who meet outside of board meetings were more important predictors of social influence than human capital or ties across boards. These ties within the board represent the social capital of members in the form of prior relationships with other directors, ties to others on the board, and membership in cliques within the board's network of ties. These results support a social capital perspective on influence that emphasizes relationships with others on the board as important factors in the social dynamics of board decision-making.","['nanCORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'POWER', 'PERFORMANCE', 'NETWORKS', 'STRATEGY', 'AGENCY', 'INDEPENDENCE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'COOPERATION', 'INTERLOCKS']",['independence'],making

"Control in emerging organizations is becoming increasingly problematic due to the need for increasing employee discretion of behavior stemming from greater uncertainty of how to accomplish tasks. Traditional control processes, based on the use of rules and supervision, are largely ineffective for effectively controlling behavior where there is uncertainty and ambiguity about how to successfully carry out task. This problem is approached here from an information processing perspective. Our contention is that effective control of tasks, that is, assuring goal attainment, is the result of linking the information processing (IF) requirements of tasks with information processing capabilities of three control strategies: objective controls, normative controls and self-management. A set of propositions are proposed suggesting that as IP requirements increase, there is greater reliance on normative and self-management control strategies for effective task completion. However, these high IP capability strategies will be effective only to the extent that the opportunity for control loss inherent in these strategies is reduced through investments in bonding and trust.","['nanMANAGERIAL EFFECTIVENESS', 'SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS', 'SELF-MANAGEMENT', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'LEADERSHIP', 'CULTURE', 'DESIGN']","['self management', 'self management']",behavior perspective trust

Retention policies are related to the employment relationship. However, the overall HR philosophy is not related to either organizational strategy or the employment relationship.

"Recent research in consumer behavior has documented the phenomenon of compensatory consumption, whereby individuals respond to information about deficits in their abilities, skills, status, and so forth by consuming products that symbolically compensate for the self-deficits. However, the examination of factors that might lead individuals to take more productive action in response to self-deficit information is limited. This article identifies self-acceptance as a moderator of when individuals engage in compensatory consumption versus adaptive consumption (i.e., consumption intended to help the individual improve in the area of deficit) in response to self-deficit information. Three studies show that, through self-acceptance, individuals reduce compensatory consumption and are more likely to engage in adaptive consumption to address self-deficits. Evidence suggests that self-acceptance affects individuals' responses to self-deficit information by changing their appraisal of self-deficits from harmful to benign to their self-worth. We distinguish self-acceptance from the related constructs of self-esteem, self-affirmation, and apathy.","['nanAFFIRMATION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'ESTEEM', 'ACTIVATION', 'DISSONANCE', 'HYPEROPIA', 'THERAPY', 'CHOICES']","['behavior', 'esteem']",acceptance esteem affirmation apathy
"Information asymmetry is a condition wherein one party in a relationship has more or better information than another. The information asymmetry concept is widely diffused throughout management research, and its existence is a core assumption within leading theories on organizations. Despite information asymmetry's central role, however, there have been no systematic reviews of the management literature using the concept. As a result, there is no established level of knowledge of information asymmetry as a management concept, nor is there a unified basis for directing future research leveraging the concept. In response, we review 223 relevant articles from leading management journals and develop a framework for organizing and assessing information asymmetry research. We consolidate understanding of information asymmetry's meaning, conceptual applications, roles in different theoretical models, antecedents, and how focal actors' self-interests influence the selection of mechanisms for managing it. Further, we highlight opportunities for extensions to core management theories and specify research prospects within several management subfields. Overall, the framework can help guide researchers as they work to advance understanding of one of the management field's most ubiquitous concepts.","['information asymmetry', 'asymmetric information', 'information impactednessRESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'REPUTATION-PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIP', 'AGENCY THEORY', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'ADVERSE SELECTION', 'SIGNALING THEORY', 'FIRM RESOURCES', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'STRATEGIC BEHAVIOR']","['information asymmetry', 'information asymmetry']",information asymmetry leading theories organizations

Analyses of Massachusetts railroad foundings between 1825 and 1922 show that public capitalization raises the number of foundings by increasing available resources, pro-cartel policies raise the number of foundings by dampening competition from incumbents, and antitrust depresses foundings by stimulating competition. Ecological factors only show the expected effects once policy is controlled.

It contributes toward theory on boundary spanning by introducing a cultural identity negotiation conceptual framework. We show boundary spanning as a process shaped through the interplay of the contextual issues that make a boundary problematic; an individual's multiple repertoires of cultural knowledge; and the individual boundary spanner's negotiation, through interaction with others, of his/her cultural identities - the sense of who I am as a cultural being that is fundamental to an individual's self-concept. At the same time, we make transparent the epistemological and methodological foundations of an interpretive ethnographic approach, demonstrating its value for understanding complex organizational processes. Research findings have practical implications for the selection and training of an organization's employees, particularly of persons who may be considered bicultural.

"P>By combining insights from relational network theory and agency theory we identify the boundary conditions to the embeddedness approach to partner selection decisions in interfirm collaborations. Employing a longitudinal dataset comprising the investment syndicates for the population of UK management buyouts between 1993 and 2003, we find that relational embeddedness is less important for selecting partners when agency risks are low, allowing firms to expand their networks. Furthermore, reputational capital may act as a partial substitute for relational embeddedness, again permitting firms to expand their networks. Our findings enhance understanding of the boundary conditions associated with the relational network approach to partner selections and network behaviour.","['nanVENTURE CAPITALIST', 'SOCIAL-STRUCTURE', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION', 'ECONOMIC-PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'AGENCY COSTS', 'SYNDICATION', 'INVESTMENT', 'NETWORKS', 'TRUST']","['investment', 'networks']",agency partner selection firms
"This paper makes a case directed towards establishing the importance of global strategic considerations in choosing multinationals' entry mode. Specifically, it is our contention that beyond the environmental and transaction-specific factors well established in the literature to affect the entry mode decision, we should also consider the strategic relationship a multinational envisages between its operations across borders in reaching this decision. After incorporating various global strategic variables into an eclectic framework of the factors influencing the entry mode choice, this paper tests both the validity of the overall framework and the importance of each entry mode determinant in differentiating among entry modes. This is done based on ninety-six multinational managers' responses to a survey questionnaire concerning their entry mode decision experiences. The results suggest that an express incorporation of global strategic variables into an analysis of the entry mode decision is warranted.","['nanDISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS', 'FRAMEWORK', 'COST']",['framework'],entry mode
"Purpose - This paper aims to examine what drives the adoption of different social sustainability supply chain practices. Research has shown that certain factors drive the adoption of environmental sustainability practices but few focus on social supply chain practices, delineate which practices are adopted or what drives their adoption. Design/methodology/approach - The authors examine the facilitative role of sustainability culture to explain the adoption of social sustainability supply chain practices: basic practices, consisting of monitoring and management systems and advanced practices, which are new product and process development and strategic redefinition. The authors then explore the role played by a firm's entrepreneurial orientation in shaping and reinforcing the adoption of social sustainability supply chain practices. A survey of 156 supply chain managers in multiple industries in Ireland was conducted to test the relationship between the variables. Findings - The findings show that sustainability culture is positively related to all the practices, and entrepreneurial orientation impacts and moderates social sustainability culture in advanced social sustainability supply chain adoption. Research limitations/implications - As with any survey, this is a single point in time with a single respondent. Implications for managers include finding the right culture in the organisation to implement social sustainability supply chain management practices that go beyond monitoring to behavioural changes in the supply chain with implications beyond the dyad of buyer and supplier to lower tier suppliers and the community surrounding the supply chain. Practical implications - The implications for managers include developing and fostering cultural attributes in the organisation to implement social sustainability supply chain management practices that go beyond monitoring suppliers to behavioural changes in the supply chain with implications beyond the dyad of buyer and supplier to lower tier suppliers and the community surrounding the supply chain. Originality/value - This is the first time, to the authors' knowledge, that cultural and entrepreneurial variables have been tested for social sustainability supply chain practices, giving them new insights into how and why social sustainability supply chain practices are adopted.","['Sustainability', 'Sustainable supply chains', 'Social factorsCONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK', 'ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY', 'CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTALISM', 'INSTITUTIONAL PRESSURES', 'PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES', 'MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'RISK-MANAGEMENT', 'RESPONSIBILITY', 'CSR']","['sustainability', 'environmental sustainability', 'environmental sustainability', 'management practices', 'management practices']",sustainability environmental sustainability culture monitoring management entrepreneurial orientation supply management
"A multinational enterprise develops its subsidiary portfolio by investing in new foreign markets and subsequently pursuing further investments within these host countries. We find that firms which locate their first equity investment closer to the national capital city can subsequently expand their subsidiary portfolio within the host country at a higher speed. This effect is particularly strong in emerging economies. Further analyses of various contingencies support the robustness of our findings. We discuss different theoretical mechanisms which could cause these effects, in particular face-to-face interactions with governmental actors and opportunities to develop political connections. Our research contributes to the literature on internationalization processes by analyzing how the initial location choice affects the development of the subsidiary portfolio.","['internationalization', 'MNEs', 'expansion speed', 'subsidiary portfolio', 'capital cities', 'geographic distanceSOUTH-KOREAN FIRMS', 'JAPANESE FIRMS', 'INTERNATIONALIZATION PROCESS', 'MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISES', 'POLITICAL CONNECTIONS', 'FOREIGN-INVESTMENT', 'EMERGING MARKETS', 'BUSINESS GROUPS', 'GLOBAL CITIES', 'STRATEGIES']","['internationalization', 'subsidiary portfolio', 'subsidiary portfolio', 'internationalization process', 'internationalization process', 'political connections', 'political connections']",portfolio internationalization choice

The findings also reveal that psychic distance is asymmetrical in nature, and that assessments made by sellers and their buyers are inherently inequivalent.","['psychic distance', 'internationalization', 'foreign market entryINTERNATIONALIZATION PROCESS', 'CULTURAL DISTANCE', 'SOCIAL TIES', 'FOREIGN', 'FIRM', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INVESTMENT', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['psychic distance', 'psychic distance', 'foreign']",psychic distance entry
"Past research focuses predominantly on self-enhancement as a motive underlying organizational identification even though there have been several calls for examining multiple motives of identification. Our research explores the interplay of the self-enhancement and the uncertainty reduction motives in shaping identification during a major organizational change: a merger of a business unit with its parent corporation. Based on analysis of survey responses collected from 751 employees of the merging business unit, we find that the self-enhancement motive, measured via attractiveness of perceived organizational identity and perceived external prestige, continues to influence identification during this merger. However, its effects are diminished when considering the effect of the uncertainty reduction motive. In particular, in addition to affecting identification directly, this latter motive, measured via agreement with projected identity of the business unit and identification with a distal target (i.e., the parent corporation), decreases the effect of perceived external prestige on business unit identification. Our research answers longstanding calls for understanding organizational identification motives beyond self-enhancement, and shows how multiple identification motives work during a major organizational change: a time when identification is strongly needed, yet hard to garner.","['identification motives', 'organizational change', 'organizational identification', 'quantitativePERCEIVED EXTERNAL PRESTIGE', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY THEORY', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'DUAL IDENTIFICATION', 'MODEL', 'WORK', 'COMMUNICATION', 'IMPACT', 'IMAGE', 'FOCI']","['identification motives', 'identification motives', 'organizational change', 'organizational change', 'organizational identification', 'organizational identification', 'work']",self enhancement identity

"Analysis of a 42-year strategic journey at a large multinational firm exposes the dynamics behind its strategic evolution. Grounded on a complexity science paradigm, this article challenges our understanding of the role of agency in strategic timing while adding conceptual and methodological innovations. Based on micro and macro approaches, qualitative interpretations, and econometric studies, the results tend to show that while agency partly produces strategy dynamics and timing of actions, strategic evolution (when not random) is largely emergent and driven by its past. These findings move the understanding of strategic evolution and timing away from a strategic choice perspective and toward a complex combination of agency, causal determinism, and self-organization.

"Based on the job-crafting perspective, we theorized a serial curvilinear mediated moderation model that links underemployment to two outcomes that benefit the organization: creativity and organizational citizenship behavior. A three-waved time-lagged survey of teachers and a field study of technical workers provided convergent support for this model. In Study 1, using data from 327 teachers and their immediate supervisors, we found support for our hypotheses that perceived underemployment had an inverted U-shaped relationship with task crafting and that this relationship was moderated by organizational identification. When the teachers' organizational identification was high, they engaged in more task crafting for the organization at intermediate levels of perceived underemployment. We also found that task crafting was positively related to creativity and organizational citizenship behavior. In Study 2, the simulation tasks for 297 technical workers provided convergent evidence for the idea that objective underemployment indirectly influences objective task crafting through perceived underemployment with the inverted U-shaped path from perceived underemployment to task crafting. We discussed the theoretical and practical implications of this research.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'POTENTIALLY BAD SITUATION', 'PERCEIVED OVERQUALIFICATION', 'EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY', 'JOB-SATISFACTION', 'TEAM PERFORMANCE', 'WORK', 'MEDIATION', 'OUTCOMES', 'VOICE']","['work', 'outcomes']",job crafting identification
"The location choice of product innovations is a prevalent phenomenon one that has received little attention in the literature. This study examines the ways in which comparative industry environment, technology and product characteristics, and entry timing affect the firm's location choice of new product development activities between headquarters and foreign subsidiaries and the implications of location choice for performance. Our findings indicate that: (1) firms are more likely to locate their new product development activities at foreign subsidiaries in mainland China than at headquarters in Taiwan when the industry environment at foreign subsidiaries is more favorable, when technologies and products are more mature, and when the entry to mainland China's market is earlier than that of its competitors; (2) in general, firms locating their new product development activities at headquarters in Taiwan perform better than firms locating their new product development activities at foreign subsidiaries in mainland China after controlling for endogeneity bias; (3) firms locating their new product development activities at headquarters (at foreign subsidiaries) perform better than if they had located their new product development activities at foreign subsidiaries (at headquarters).

"Ensuring joint program participation by distributors is essential to channel management. Although studies confirm that firms can promote distributor participation by attending to their participation motivations, the authors argue that distributors may change their motivations over the course of a joint program, driven by an increase of program-related information and how their peer distributors behave. Drawing insights from the information asymmetry literature, the authors postulate that distributors' ex ante commitment is driven by their motivation to avoid losses, and after they participate, their ex post adaptation reflects rent-seeking motivations. This study also examines how the participation of peer distributors operates as an information signal that moderates the motivation participation link for the focal distributor. In the context of an actual sales program, this study confirms the postulate of motivation shift and the salience of network-based information in distributors' program participation. The results show that a manufacturer needs to manage its distributors' participation in a discriminant, process-oriented, and system-sensitive manner by addressing the latter's diverse motivations, changing goals in the joint program, and influences from peer distributors.","['marketing channel', 'information asymmetry', 'program participation', 'risk-avoidance motivation', 'rent-seeking motivationBUYER-SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS', 'GOVERNANCE VALUE ANALYSIS', 'MARKETING RELATIONSHIPS', 'CHANNEL RELATIONSHIPS', 'CREDIBLE COMMITMENTS', 'AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS', 'SELLER RELATIONSHIPS', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'LIFE-CYCLE', 'PERFORMANCE']","['information asymmetry', 'information asymmetry', 'program participation', 'program participation']",commitment rent seeking
"The literature has posited that agglomeration economies and the formation of social relationships resulting from the geographic concentration of incumbents constitute the forces that pull new entrants into industry clusters. However, this proposition overlooks how the collective action of incumbents in pursuit of their own benefits affects new entrants. This study examines how business associations as collective action organizations established by incumbents to promote and safeguard group-wide interests contribute to de novo entrants. The empirical evidence from Canada's telecommunication equipment manufacturing industry between 1995 and 2005 reveals that the prevalence of local business associations encourages de novo entrants. However, the impact is curvilinear such that excessive collective action on the part of local fellow incumbents can create a clubby environment and push new entrants away.","['new venture creation', 'collective action organizations', 'economic agglomeration', 'industry cluster', 'business association', 'de novo entrantsKNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS', 'GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION', 'BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS', 'UNITED-STATES', 'AGGLOMERATION', 'INDUSTRY', 'CLUSTERS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'NETWORKS', 'GROWTH']","['collective action organizations', 'collective action organizations', 'collective action organizations', 'industry cluster', 'industry cluster', 'business association', 'business association', 'geographic concentration', 'geographic concentration', 'business associations', 'business associations', 'agglomeration', 'industry', 'clusters']",agglomeration industry business associations organizations
"Communication and information technologies are adding new capabilities for rapid and inexpensive customer input to all stages of the product development (PD) process. In this article we review six web-based methods of customer input as examples of the improved Internet capabilities of communication, conceptualization, and computation, For each method we give examples of user-interfaces, initial applications, and validity tests. We critique the applicability of the methods for use in the various stages of PD and discuss how they complement existing methods. For example, during the fuzzy front end of PD the information pump enables customers to interact with each other in a web-based game that provides incentives for truth-telling and thinking hard, thus providing new ways for customers to verbalize the product features that are important to them. Fast polyhedral adaptive conjoint estimation enables PD teams to screen larger numbers of product features inexpensively to identify and measure the importance of the most promising features for further development. Meanwhile, interactive web-based conjoint analysis interfaces are moving this proven set of methods to the web while exploiting new capabilities to present products, features, product use, and marketing elements in streaming multimedia representations. User design exploits the interactivity of the web to enable users to design their own virtual products thus enabling the PD team to understand complex feature interactions and enabling customers to learn their own preferences for new products. These methods can be valuable for identifying opportunities, improving the design and engineering of products, and testing ideas and concepts much earlier in the process when less time and money is at risk. As products move toward pretesting and testing, virtual concept testing on the web enables PD teams to test concepts without actually building the product. Further, by combining virtual concepts and the ability of customers to interact with one another in a stock-market-like game, securities trading of concepts provides a novel way to identify winning concepts. Prototypes of all six methods are available and have been tested with real products and real customers. These tests demonstrate reliability for web-based conjoint analysis, polyhedral methods, virtual concept testing, and stock-market-like trading; external validity for web-based conjoint analysis and polyhedral methods and consistency for web-based conjoint analysis versus user design. We report on these tests, commercial applications, and other evaluations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

"Building on the 'entrepreneuring as emancipation' perspective, I explore the emancipatory potential of social entrepreneurship as a means to disengage individuals enthralled to ideology and trapped by their own past behavior. I studied two former religious-based terrorists from Indonesia, and their social enterprise, a cafe chain, which has successfully emancipated 10 ex-terrorists. In this paper, I show how engagement in entrepreneurship can be emancipatory through allowing individuals not only to escape some ideological constraints but also to construct new meaning in life and new social roles and connections that provide a platform for building a new future. Importantly, because social entrepreneurship as a form of organizing permits autonomy from an exclusive focus on profitability, it afforded the entrepreneurs I studied to achieve a degree of emancipation both for themselves and also for those they served. My results also have substantial practical value in elucidating a potentially valuable tool in efforts to reduce terrorist violence. I develop a grounded process model of social entrepreneurship as emancipatory work to summarize the study and offer avenues for future research. (C) 2017 The Author.

"The purpose of this study is to integrate the notion of extra-role performance with the current understanding of the relationships among salesperson job attitudes (job satisfaction and organizational commitment), role perceptions (ambiguity and conflict), in- and extra-role behavior, and turnover. The authors develop and test a theoretical model that specifies the relationships between in- and extra-role performance and salesperson job satisfaction, organizational commitment, role perceptions, and turnover using cross-sectional data from a large sample (N = 672) of commission sales personnel. The results generally indicate that performance and job attitudes mediate the relationships between role perceptions and turnover. However, the most notable aspect of the findings is that they are consistent with the hypothesis that in- and extra-role performance are intertwined, with in-role performance serving as an antecedent of job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and extra-role performance as a consequence of these two variables. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for sales research.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'PRO-SOCIAL BEHAVIOR', 'JOB-SATISFACTION', 'META-ANALYSIS', 'ROLE-CONFLICT', 'EMPLOYEE CITIZENSHIP', 'SALES PERFORMANCE', 'WORK PERFORMANCE', 'ROLE CLARITY', 'ROLE STRESS']","['job satisfaction', 'job satisfaction']",behavior model

Results from the two-stage least squares panel regression estimation indicate research intensity is positively associated with the firm's degree of internationalization. The relationship is strengthened by the concentration of ownership by family and affiliated business group firms, the board of directors' professionalization, the wedge between voting and cash-flow rights, and the board interlocks of professional directors; but weakened by the board interlocks of family directors.

"Institutional theory implies that normative societal expectations create pressures for organizations to respond acceptably to important institutional constituents. Although the role of the institutional environment on marketing has been studied, the organizational mechanisms by which firms respond to societal pressures remain under-investigated. We suggest that an important determining factor involves organizational identity, which drives firm response to societal norms and facilitates its quest for legitimacy. Accordingly, this study contributes to organizational theory in marketing by casting identity as the focal mechanism in the firm's response to the institutional environment. Marketing ethics and CSR issues frame this research given natural synergies with institutional and organizational identity theories and evidence that increasingly, firms must respond to societal expectations involving ethics in their marketing practices. Using game theoretical models and economic experiments, we find that the influence of the institutional environment emerges through firm identity, affecting resource allocation to ethical product augmentation.","['Institutional theory', 'Organizational identity theory', 'Marketing ethics', 'Corporate social responsibility', 'Game theory', 'Experimental economicsCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'FIRM', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'ASSOCIATIONS', 'ORIENTATION', 'REPUTATION', 'FRAMEWORK', 'STRATEGY', 'IMAGE']","['institutional theory', 'institutional theory', 'marketing ethics', 'marketing ethics', 'firm']",institutional theory organizational identity legitimacy ethics models
"Recent scholarship on the returns to labor market specialization often claims that being specialized is advantageous for job candidates. We argue, in contrast, that a specialist discount may occur in contexts that share three features: strong institutionalized mechanisms, candidate profiles with direct investments that signal their value, and a high supply of focused candidates relative to demand. We then test whether there is a specialist discount for graduating elite MBAs, as it is a labor market that exemplifies these conditions under which we expect specialists to be penalized. Using rich data on two graduating cohorts from a top-tier U.S. business school, we show that elite MBA graduates who established a focused (specialized) market profile of experiences relating to investment banking before and during the program were less likely to receive multiple job offers and were offered less in starting-bonus compensation than similar MBA candidates with no exposure or less-focused exposure to investment banking. Our theory and findings suggest that the oft-documented specialist advantage may be overstated.","['specialist discount', 'investment banking', 'MBA', 'focused profile', 'compensation', 'job offer', 'business schoolQUANTILE REGRESSION', 'CAREER CHOICE', 'LABOR', 'GENDER', 'DYNAMICS', 'MOBILITY', 'MARKETS', 'GROWTH']","['specialist discount', 'specialist discount', 'investment banking', 'investment banking', 'mba', 'compensation', 'job offer', 'job offer', 'labor']",returns market discount compensation
"The Nigerian consumer obsession with foreign-made goods has had a detrimental effect on the domestic manufacturing industry. This paper uses conjoint analysis to investigate the importance of a product's country-of-manufacture relative to other attributes in the Nigerian consumer choice. It was found that the country-of-manufacture is significantly more important than price and other product attributes in consumer preference. Nigerian consumers have a negative image of the 'Made in Nigeria' label, rating it lower than labels from more economically developed countries. Additional analyses indicate that the superior reliability and technological advancement of foreign products are the most important correlates of the Nigerian consumer's likelihood to purchase foreign products. Implications for foreign marketers, domestic governments and domestic manufacturers are discussed.","['nanCOUNTRY', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'IMAGE']",['image'],conjoint analysis choice price
"Although the use of skill-based pay has increased in popularity, empirical investigations of the effectiveness of this compensation strategy have been scarce. The fundamental premise of skill-based pay is that contingent monetary reward will promote individual learning. The authors empirically examine this essential principle with data spanning 5 years, using latent growth analysis. Results demonstrate that skill-based pay is related to individual skill change and maintenance. Whether or not individuals earn skill-based pay on their initial attempt is associated with subsequent rates of learning. In addition, the frequency with which skill-based pay is received and the total amount earned are both associated with skill development and maintenance.","['skill-based pay', 'person-based pay', 'skill change', 'latent growth analysisCOVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS', 'PRIOR JOB KNOWLEDGE', 'GOODNESS-OF-FIT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-BEHAVIOR', 'TASK-PERFORMANCE', 'INDEXES', 'METAANALYSIS', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'CRITERIA']","['skill based pay', 'skill based pay', 'skill based pay', 'skill change', 'skill change']",growth
"This study explores the generation and use of competitive intelligence (CI) within the buyer-seller exchange process and its influence on salesperson performance. Using the concept of social capital as a theoretical foundation and multilevel data collected at three time points from 686 customer-salesperson dyads, the authors empirically test a conceptual framework that proposes both antecedents and consequences of CI sharing between customer and salesperson. The results of the study demonstrate that CI sharing by customers is a function of salesperson customer orientation, customer-centric extra-role behaviors, and relationship quality. CI sharing translates into increased perceived value, share-of-wallet, and profit margins when the salesperson utilizes the information to position and differentiate his or her product; however this occurs only when the salesperson has strong adaptive selling skills. Surprisingly, CI negatively influences these outcomes among low-adaptive salespeople, indicating that CI can actually work to a firm's disadvantage if the salesperson is not equipped to respond to it. These findings suggest that CI must be examined differently than general market knowledge and that firms may leverage CI to their tactical advantage at the salesperson-customer interface if managed effectively.","['Salespeople', 'Competitive intelligence', 'Marketing intelligence', 'Social capital', 'Adaptive selling', 'Multilevel modeling', 'Perceived value', 'Information use', 'Customer orientationMARKET INTELLIGENCE', 'PERCEIVED VALUE', 'INDUSTRIAL SALESPEOPLE', 'WORKING SMART', 'SALES FORCE', 'ORIENTATION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'PERFORMANCE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'QUALITY']","['salespeople', 'competitive intelligence', 'competitive intelligence', 'social capital', 'social capital', 'adaptive selling', 'adaptive selling', 'perceived value', 'perceived value', 'perceived value', 'perceived value', 'orientation', 'behavior', 'performance', 'knowledge', 'quality']",competitive intelligence exchange salesperson customer orientation behaviors

For the conflicting hypotheses, results support Pearce's arguments that the structural assurances of facilitative governments lead to higher levels of trust in business associates.","['trust', 'social exchange', 'governments', 'guanxiUNITED-STATES', 'COMMITMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'POWER']","['trust', 'governments']",
"Most research on culture in international business either aggregates people within a country into a single, homogeneous, national culture, or examines heterogeneity within countries based on exogenous criteria. In this study, we explore heterogeneity in cultural values within and across countries endogenously through the configurations of values people share in common. We develop a theory of culture archetypes and use a novel methodology that identifies a small number of distinct configurations of values archetypes in our data. These data come from the World Values Survey 2005 and Schwartz's model of culture. We identify four culture archetypes in Japan, USA and China, and six in India. The existence of transnational and subnational archetypes across the four countries suggests the need to recognize culture as a combination of universal etic - as well as unique - emic - characteristics. Our approach also distinguishes between those individuals represented by our archetypes and those individuals who more closely resemble the average values of a country. By unifying both archetypes and national averages within one theoretical and methodological schema we thus reconcile the conflicting perspectives in the field.","['culture archetypes', 'archetypal analysis', 'Schwartz culture values', 'World Values SurveyINTERNATIONAL MARKET-SEGMENTATION', 'RESPONSE STYLES', 'UNITED-STATES', 'VALUES', 'INDIVIDUALISM', 'COLLECTIVISM', 'HOFSTEDE', 'BIAS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'EQUIVALENCE']","['culture archetypes', 'culture archetypes', 'values']",national culture cultural values
"Studies of practices in new product and service development have focused predominantly on for-profit organizations, whereas attention to the nonprofit sector has been minimal. Such attention is needed given that nonprofit organizations are unique in their structures and are growing with regards to impact on the world economy and society in general. Moreover, such disparate attention suggests a void in this discipline's understanding of new product development (NPD) practices of nonprofit organizations. Two particular research questions are posed: (1) To what extent are the practices of for-profit organizations employed in nonprofit organizations? (2) How do the practices of nonprofits compare to those of for-profit organizations? In the course of answering these questions, the present study reviewed literature and the Product Development and Management Association (PDMA) certification work. The study subsequently identified six dimensions of successful NPD efforts: strategy, portfolio management, process, market research, people, and metrics and performance measurement. These dimensions were applied via an in-depth case-study methodology to six large, U. S. nonprofit organizations: American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Red Cross, Boys and Girls Club of America, and Goodwill Industries. The dimensions assisted in categorizing and analyzing the responses of 40 respondents across the six organizations. Results show that some NPD practices of large nonprofit organizations are similar to for-profit organizations, but other practices are more distinctive and related to the nature of nonprofit organizations. Large nonprofit organizations tend to be very good at articulating their mission, embedding it throughout, and using it to drive programs and activities. These organizations tend to view product development as a tactical endeavor versus a strategic one and do not engage in portfolio management practices for their new programs. Instead, broad criteria such as fit with mission, funding availability, and presence of a champion are used for evaluating programs. The NPD process tends to be informal with little structure, and individual departments and local chapters tend to undertake their own NPD initiatives and have their own process for doing so. Non-profits place a heavy emphasis on ideation and less emphasis on other activities such as concept development and testing, project evaluation, and business analysis. Pilot testing is the most used type of market research. These results suggest that NPD processes within large nonprofit organizations share some of the same weaknesses as those of for-profit organizations, with NPD metrics being a particularly weak area. The NPD practices of nonprofits also have some unique characteristics that include the following: a heavy emphasis on the mission, a desire for flexibility, strong influence of external sponsors, and difficulty in assessing long-term program success. Management of nonprofit NPD and directions for future research are discussed.","['nanSERVICES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SUCCESS', 'FAILURE']","['performance', 'success']",impact performance
"This article investigates how securities analysts help investors understand the value of diversification. By studying the research that analysts produce about companies that have announced corporate spin-offs, we gain unique insights into how analysts portray diversified firms to the investment community. We find that while analysts' research about these companies is associated with improved forecast accuracy, the value of their research about the spun-off subsidiaries is more limited. For both diversified firms and their spun-off subsidiaries, analysts' research is more valuable when information asymmetry between the management of these entities and investors is higher. These findings contribute to the corporate strategy literature by shedding light on the roots of the diversification discount and by showing how analysts' research enables investors to overcome asymmetric information.

"Customers increasingly rely on other consumers' reviews to make purchase decisions online. New insights into the customer review phenomenon can be derived from studying the semantic content and style properties of verbatim customer reviews to examine their influence on online retail sites' conversion rates. The authors employ text mining to extract changes in affective content and linguistic style properties of customer book reviews on Amazon.com. A dynamic panel data model reveals that the influence of positive affective content on conversion rates is asymmetrical, such that greater increases in positive affective content in customer reviews have a smaller effect on subsequent increases in conversion rate. No such tapering-off effect occurs for changes in negative affective content in reviews. Furthermore, positive changes in affective cues and increasing congruence with the product interest group's typical linguistic style directly and conjointly increase conversion rates. These findings suggest that managers should identify and promote the most influential reviews in a given product category, provide instructions to stimulate reviewers to write powerful reviews, and adapt the style of their own editorial reviews to the relevant product category.","['online customer reviews', 'affective content', 'linguistic style match', 'conversion rate', 'Internet marketingOF-MOUTH', 'SOURCE CREDIBILITY', 'PRODUCT REVIEWS', 'PANEL-DATA', 'DYNAMICS', 'LANGUAGE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'SALES', 'ATTITUDES', 'PRICE']","['affective content', 'affective content', 'conversion rate', 'conversion rate', 'panel data', 'panel data']",semantic content conversion text mining data model
"This paper addresses the effects on corporate restructuring of changing management and ownership. First, it synthesises a number of perspectives on corporate restructuring which involve managerial succession, voluntary restructuring, agency theory, incentives and entrepreneurship, to obtain insights into the relative impact of simultaneously changing either, neither or both management and ownership. Second, it uses case study evidence from management buy-ins to examine the effects of changing both management and ownership. The evidence suggests that whilst management may be adequately incentivized, problems may arise in respect of information asymmetries, difficulties in matching entrepreneurs to the context and monitoring by venture capitalists, and implementation of strategies.","['nanFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'LEVERAGED BUYOUTS', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'CHALLENGES', 'ACQUISITIONS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'FIRMS', 'OUTS']","['entrepreneurship', 'perspective']",restructuring succession entrepreneurship venture capitalists
"Recent years have seen the introduction of a marketing dashboard that brings the firm's key marketing metrics into a single display. Service firms across industries have created such dashboards either by themselves or together with a dashboard service provider. This article examines the reasons for this development and explains what dashboards are, how to develop them, what drives their adoption, and which academic research is needed to fully exploit their potential. Overcoming the challenges faced in dashboard development and operation provides many opportunities for marketing to exercise a stronger influence on top management decisions. The article outlines five stages of dashboard development and discusses the relationships among demand for dashboards, supply of dashboards, and the implementation process in driving adoption and use of dashboard systems. Key topics for future research include metrics selection, relationships among metrics, and the ultimate question of whether dashboards provide sufficient benefits to justify their adoption.","['metrics', 'dashboards', 'accountability', 'decision supportCUSTOMER EQUITY', 'MODELS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'SUPPORT', 'STRATEGY', 'QUALITY', 'FOCUS']","['metrics', 'dashboards', 'management']",dashboard adoption implementation
"This article investigates how the individual difference variable of state versus action orientation moderates the pattern of relationships among constructs in the theory of reasoned action. State orientation refers to a low capacity for the enactment of action-related mental structures, whereas action orientation refers to a high capacity for this type of enactment. A field study was conducted in the context of consumers' self-reported usage of coupons for grocery shopping. The results showed that state versus action orientation moderates the relative importance of determinants of intentions; specifically, subjective norms become more important as people become state oriented, whereas the relative importance of attitudes increases as people become action oriented. In addition, the study showed that past behavior is a determinant of intentions to use coupons.","['nanATTITUDE-BEHAVIOR RELATIONSHIP', 'PREDICTIVE-VALIDITY', 'SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS', 'CAUSAL RELATIONS', 'INTENTIONS', 'MODELS', 'MODERATOR', 'FISHBEIN', 'PSYCHOLOGY', 'COGNITIONS']",['intentions'],coupons
"Why do some new technologies emerge and quickly supplant incumbent technologies while others take years or decades to take off? We explore this question by presenting a framework that considers both the focal competing technologies as well as the ecosystems in which they are embedded. Within our framework, each episode of technology transition is characterized by the ecosystem emergence challenge that confronts the new technology and the ecosystem extension opportunity that is available to the old technology. We identify four qualitatively distinct regimes with clear predictions for the pace of substitution. Evidence from 10 episodes of technology transitions in the semiconductor lithography equipment industry from 1972 to 2009 offers strong support for our framework. We discuss the implication of our approach for firm strategy.

"This article provides and tests a theoretical framework with a multilevel (country-city) nested model to analyze the relationship between national business regulations (NBRs) and city level entrepreneurship. While public interest theory predicts a positive relationship between NBR and city level entrepreneurship, public choice theory predicts the opposite, a negative relationship. Based on multilevel analysis for a matched country-city panel of 228 cities across 20 European countries for the years 2004 to 2009, the empirical evidence from panel data estimation explains how changes in NBRs influence changes in city level entrepreneurial activity over time.","['entrepreneurship', 'city', 'government policy', 'regulation', 'Europe', 'multilevel JEL', 'L26 M13 R10 O17ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT', 'REGIONAL-DEVELOPMENT', 'EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE', 'FIRM FORMATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'TAXES']","['entrepreneurship', 'city', 'regulation', 'europe', 'empirical evidence', 'empirical evidence']",city public interest european
"Purpose This paper aims to make an empirical contribution by investigating the enforcement mechanisms and governance structures required to protect and govern a regional food product when public certification fails. As one of the recent additions to South Africa's repertoire of products with a designated origin, Karoo Lamb made for an interesting case study. Design/methodology/approach A conjoint analysis was conducted to elicit the farmers' preferred enforcement mechanisms to protect the authenticity of the Karoo Lamb product. The investigation, furthermore, draws on survey data collected among 73 farmers, five abattoirs, two processors/packers and five retail outlets to evaluate the governance structures of the Karoo Lamb supply chain. Findings The results indicate that due to failed public certification that is governed by market-like structures, Karoo Lamb is better off being governed by hierarchical structures. These structures are expected to allow for a stronger focus on stricter enforcement mechanisms. Practical implications - At the farm level, the Karoo Lamb supply chain requires better enforcement mechanisms to protect the unique attributes of origin and taste to ensure the authenticity of Karoo Lamb. This change towards stricter enforcement requires more hierarchical structures to allow for private or mutual enforcement mechanisms. Originality/value This paper contributes empirically to the governance structure knowledge base by analysing the enforcement mechanisms and governance structures needed to enforce and protect, the quality and origin standards of a region of origin product, Karoo Lamb, in South Africa.","['Monitoring', 'Governance', 'Supplier relationships', 'Meat industry', 'Conjoint analysis', 'Supply chain disruptions', 'Enforcement mechanisms', 'Governance structures', 'Conjoint experiment', 'Transactional model', 'Karoo Lamb', 'South AfricaTRANSACTION-COST-ECONOMICS', 'CHAIN GOVERNANCE', 'CONJOINT-ANALYSIS', 'FOOD SAFETY', 'PREFERENCES', 'ATTRIBUTES', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ALIGNMENT', 'KEIRETSU', 'MARKET']","['governance', 'conjoint analysis', 'conjoint analysis', 'enforcement mechanisms', 'enforcement mechanisms', 'governance structures', 'governance structures', 'karoo lamb', 'karoo lamb', 'conjoint analysis', 'conjoint analysis', 'attributes', 'market']",enforcement mechanisms structures africa origin authenticity chain
"This study examines the role of national culture on the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) rhetoric contained within franchisee recruitment promotional materials, where EO rhetoric is defined as the strategic use of words in organizational narratives to convey the risk taking, innovativeness, proactiveness, autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness of the firm. The sample comprised 378 franchise organizations, in five different countries (Australia, France, India, South Africa, and the UK). The results indicate that franchise systems operating in high uncertainty avoidance and feminine cultures use less entrepreneurially oriented rhetoric, suggesting that EO rhetoric in franchise organizations varies according to different national cultural contexts.","['franchising', 'entrepreneurial orientation', 'national cultureAIDED TEXT ANALYSIS', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'VALUES', 'FIRMS', 'INDIVIDUALISM', 'DIMENSIONS', 'INNOVATION', 'CONSTRUCT', 'HOFSTEDE']","['entrepreneurial orientation', 'entrepreneurial orientation']",orientation contexts
"We use agency, theory to predict the influence of related and unrelated product diversification on a firm's level of debt financing. Further, we argue that the link between diversification and capital structure is moderated by the environment in which firms operate. Using SAS PROC MIXED, we fit a mixed-effects model to our unique six-year longitudinal dataset (1995-2000) of 245 publicly listed Singapore firms. Our data spans the period of the Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998). We find that firms pursuing unrelated product diversification take on less debt financing in stable environments, but more debt financing in dynamic environments. Using longitudinal structural equation modeling, we find a reciprocal relationship between a firm's product diversification strategy and its debt financing level.

"We study a longitudinal fit model of adaptation and its association with the longitudinal risk-return relationship. The model allows the firm to adjust its position in response to partial learning about a changing environment characterized by two path-dependent processesa random walk and a stochastic trend. Computational simulations at low levels of learning in both environmental contexts are consistent with empirical data. However, the results are also consistent when firm behavior appears to be mindless in the form of a random walk. Hence, both imperfect learning and a mindless random walk can lead to the inverse longitudinal risk-return relationships observed empirically. We discuss this apparent paradox and the possible resolution between mindless and conscious behavior as plausible causes of the longitudinal Bowman Paradox.

"Alliance networks are strategic decisions involving trade-offs between two stylized structural design choices: prominent and entrepreneurial. Prominent alliance networks emphasize benefits arising out of multiple access and affiliation to other prominent firms in the network. An entrepreneurial position, on the other hand, emphasizes brokerage and diversity benefits arising out of access to nonredundant and diverse information. We demonstrate that the performance benefits of each type of alliance network are contingent on environmental change and strategy, and are thus time dependent. Following an environmental change event in the steel industry, alliance networks that were more entrepreneurial performed better, while those that were more prominent suffered performance decline. However, when the change was radical, both types of alliance networks were negatively related to performance. We suggest that following a radical change, industry alliance networks may not have the requisite information necessary for quick and effective strategic responses. Firms pursuing an analyzer strategy performed better when emphasizing a prominent, and to a lesser extent, entrepreneurial alliance network. However, firms that develop an alliance network high on both prominent and entrepreneurial structural positions had lower relative performance. Our results indicate the need for managers to assess their alliance portfolio over time and redesign it based on environmental and strategic contingencies.

"In spite of the consensus on the benefits of strategic alliances for learning and innovation, our understanding of the effects of partner similarity remains conflicted. This paper develops an integrative theoretical framework in which we propose that similar partners in a focal firm's alliance portfolio contribute to the firm's innovation up to a threshold, beyond which additional similar partners can lead to a decrease in innovation because of the trade-offs embedded in collaboration between similar partners. In this integrative framework, we also draw on organizational ecology and institutional perspectives to propose that the effect of partner similarity on innovation is positively moderated by organizational aging and the industry norm of collaboration at the firm's founding. Results from an analysis of 176 biotechnology firms between 1988 and 1999 support our arguments. This study contributes to research on strategic alliance and innovation by considering both the benefits and costs of partner similarity in the context of alliance portfolios and by exploring the multilevel contingencies for the effects of partner similarity.","['nanINTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'SOCIAL-STRUCTURE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'NETWORKS', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'COOPERATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'DYNAMICS', 'SEARCH']",['search'],innovation partner similarity alliance portfolio biotechnology alliance portfolios
"This study investigates the role of leader-member exchange in moderating the effects of perceptions of organizational justice and politics on job performance. In contrast to previous research, which has relied on social exchange theory to explain these relationships, the current study uses uncertainty management theory to propose that relationships between employee perceptions of the context (e.g., perceptions of organizational politics, procedural justice, and distributive justice) and performance are stronger for employees who have lower quality leader-member exchange relationships with their supervisors. Analysis of data from a sample of 157 government employees and their supervisors provided partial support for the three hypothesized interactions and indicated that leaders play an important role in determining how employees respond to their perceptions of politics and justice and that neither social exchange theory nor uncertainty management theory fully explained our results.

The empirically grounded framework induced through our research offers two key theoretical elaborations. First, it extends the existing set of theorized antecedents by highlighting the overlooked roles played by dramatic performances (staged or improvised) and ambient conditions (project, actor and venue considerations). Second, it calls attention to the consequences of emotional arousal for such entrepreneurial outcomes as generating novel solutions to specific problems encountered during the creation process, developing innovative end products, and fostering a general context for innovation.

"Trading partners continue to make significant investments in information technology (IT) infrastructure to facilitate the flow of market information across supply chains, yet the underlying mechanisms linking IT implementation to firm performance have not been clearly specified. Drawing on the resource-advantage theory of competition, we develop and test a model that proposes market-oriented IT competence as a mediator of the effects of a firm's IT infrastructure on market information flow which, in turn, yields comparative advantages in supply chain relationships. Market-oriented IT competence is conceptualized as a firm's ability to deploy an IT infrastructure in support of the organization-wide collection, dissemination and use of market information to respond to market needs. We test the effects of market-oriented IT competence using data collected from managers in the logistics services industry. Findings show that market-oriented IT competence is a critical link between IT infrastructure and comparative advantage in supply chain relationships.","['Information technology competence', 'Market orientation', 'Information flow', 'Resource advantage theoryFIRM PERFORMANCE', 'INFORMATION', 'ORIENTATION', 'RESOURCES', 'QUALITY', 'MODEL', 'SUSTAINABILITY', 'STRATEGIES', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'CONSTRUCT']","['information flow', 'information flow', 'information', 'model']",advantage theory advantage
"Job titles help organizations manage their human capital and have far-reaching implications for employees' identities. Because titles do not always reflect the unique value that employees bring to their jobs, some organizations have recently experimented with encouraging employees to create their own job titles. To explore the psychological implications of self-reflective job titles, we conducted field research combining inductive qualitative and deductive experimental methods. In Study 1, a qualitative study at the Make-A-Wish Foundation, we were surprised to learn that employees experienced self-reflective job titles as reducing their emotional exhaustion. We triangulated interviews, observations, and archival documents to identify three explanatory mechanisms through which self-reflective job titles may operate: self-verification, psychological safety, and external rapport. In Study 2, a field quasi-experiment within a health care system, we found that employees who created self-reflective job titles experienced less emotional exhaustion five weeks later, whereas employees in two control groups did not. These effects were mediated by increases in self-verification and psychological safety, but not external rapport. Our research suggests that self-reflective job titles can be important vehicles for identity expression and stress reduction, offering meaningful implications for research on job titles, identity, and emotional exhaustion.","['nanPSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY', 'POSITIVE IDENTITY', 'MEDICAL RESIDENTS', 'SEX-DIFFERENCES', 'WORK', 'BURNOUT', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'VERIFICATION']","['organizations', 'verification']",job titles emotional exhaustion identity expression

Emotionally calibrated consumers made higher-quality food choices, and these effects were predictive beyond cognitive ability and cognitive calibration. In a field experiment, emotional calibration enhanced obese consumers' decision quality by attenuating the impact of impulsive eating on caloric intake and reducing the effect of a vivid presentation of food choices. Theoretical implications are discussed for consumer emotional ability, confidence, and calibration, along with a motivation explanation for our findings.

"Consumers around the globe expect firms to contribute to environmentally and socially responsible causes. Using construal level theory with a spatial distance lens, we examine effects of spatial proximity of the firm (domestic firm vs. foreign multinational corporation [MNC]), cause (domestic vs. global), and consumer cultural identity (locally oriented: nationalism and consumer ethnocentrism; distantly oriented: global identity and global citizenship through global brands) on consumer attitudes toward the firm. Across three studies with a focus on Russia and environmental causes, we consistently find that nationalism moderates consumer attitudes, whereas consumer ethnocentrism, global identity, and global citizenship through global brands do not. When firms engage in cause-related marketing and focus on proximal causes, nationalistic consumers are more favorable toward domestic firms (vs. foreign MNCs). When firms are not engaged in cause-related marketing, consumers with stronger nationalism are more favorable toward domestic firms, and consumers with weaker nationalism are more favorable toward foreign MNCs. Importantly, the effects of nationalism are mitigated when foreign MNCs and domestic firms engage with global causes. Product involvement, environmental concerns, and marketplace skepticism are predictors of attitudes toward the firm. The results highlight the importance of considering the socio-historical-political context of a given country and locally oriented nationalistic beliefs.","['cause-related marketing', 'construal level theory', 'cultural identity', 'environmental sustainability', 'nationalismCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'PERCEIVED BRAND GLOBALNESS', 'CONSUMER ETHNOCENTRISM', 'CSR', 'IDENTITY', 'ORIENTATION', 'STRATEGIES', 'INTERPLAY', 'ATTITUDES', 'FOREIGN']","['cause related marketing', 'cause related marketing', 'cause related marketing', 'construal level theory', 'construal level theory', 'construal level theory', 'cultural identity', 'cultural identity', 'consumer ethnocentrism', 'consumer ethnocentrism', 'identity', 'attitudes', 'foreign']",construal level theory spatial distance nationalism consumer ethnocentrism global brands russia cause related marketing

"Frontline employees in traditional customer service units are under increasing pressure to pursue the twin goals of providing quality service while achieving productivity gains by meeting increased sales targets-that is, being service-sales ambidextrous. Drawing from literature on organizational ambidexterity, this study explores forces that facilitate the conversion from a service-only environment to one that emphasizes both sales and service behavior. With a sample of more than 2,306 frontline employees in 267 bank branches, this study examines the impact of contextual variables on service-sales ambidexterity from a multilevel perspective. It then explores the consequences by analyzing objective financial data at the retail branch level, which reveal a significant relationship between ambidexterity and financial performance. Empowerment and transformational leadership are positively associated with service-sales ambidexterity at individual and branch levels; team support is associated with ambidexterity only at the individual employee level. Managers thus should let service workers exercise their own judgment when deciding when or what to up- or cross-sell. The delegation of authority works best for branch office veterans whose service excellence and selling both are recognized and rewarded.","['service-sales ambidexterity', 'empowerment', 'transformational leadership', 'team support', 'hierarchical linear modelingEMPIRICAL-TEST', 'ORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'MULTILEVEL', 'EMPOWERMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'ANTECEDENTS']","['service sales ambidexterity', 'service sales ambidexterity', 'service sales ambidexterity', 'empowerment', 'transformational leadership', 'transformational leadership', 'team support', 'team support', 'organizational ambidexterity', 'organizational ambidexterity', 'transformational leadership', 'transformational leadership', 'multilevel', 'empowerment', 'performance', 'consequences']",ambidexterity behavior performance

The high cognitive accessibility of round numbers can account for the overrepresentation of 0- and 5-ending prices and suggests the existence of two effects that could account for the overrepresentation of 9-ending prices: (1) a tendency of consumers to perceive a 9-ending price as a round-number price with a small amount given back and (2) a tendency of consumers to underestimate a 9-ending price by encoding it as the first round number evoked during incomplete left-to-right processing.

"In diverse industries, from grocery retailing to health care, retailers join buying groups to achieve better terms with suppliers. The authors track the buying group membership of Europe's largest grocery retailers over a 15-year period and evaluate why some buying groups are better than others in increasing retailer performance and why different members belonging to the same group do not always benefit equally from their membership. They find that, on average, buying groups indeed generate scale advantages for their members: group scale increases group members' productivity and sales and decreases their cost of goods sold. Still, bigger is not always better. Retailers benefit less from buying group scale when the group is more heterogeneous in terms of member size and when it extends its scope across too many markets. Moreover, the smaller a member is within the group and the more it overlaps with fellow members, the less it benefits.","['buying groups', 'retailing', 'alliances', 'channel relationships', 'retailer productivityFIRM', 'ALLIANCES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'NETWORKS', 'SUCCESS']","['buying groups', 'buying groups', 'retailing', 'performance']",retailers
"New strategic initiatives often take several years to execute fully and relatively few succeed. Unfortunately, classical control processes have contributed to this situation because they have been designed as feedback systems that detect problems and deviations from planned results only after they have already occurred, and because the standards to which measurements are compared are assumed to be correct or good. Recent conceptual contributors to the strategic control literature have argued for anticipatory feedforward controls, that recognize a rapidly changing and uncertain external environment. These new systems are designed to operate on a continuous basis, checking and critically evaluating assumptions, strategies, and results. This article adds to these conceptual developments by providing an explicit strategic control component to deal with low probability, high impact threatening events, namely, special alert control. In an effort to make all the latest strategic control components operationally useful, mechanisms, methods, and approaches to their efficient implementation are presented and then summarized in tabular form. An overall strategic control process diagram is provided to act as a guide for future strategic control systems. The result is a more comprehensive and workable system of strategic control.","['nanISSUE MANAGEMENT', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'EXECUTIVES', 'CRISES', 'STATE', 'ART']","['implementation', 'art']",
"Organizations today have to change constantly. Although both practitioners and scientists agree that organizational change communication is the most effective strategy to improve employee adjustment to change, little is known about how change communication enhances more proactive employee reactions to change. The present study addresses employee job crafting behaviors (i.e., seeking job resources, seeking job challenges, and reducing job demands) as a tool used by employees in order to respond to and cope with implemented organizational change. Using regulatory focus theory, we propose that on the basis of their promotion or prevention regulatory focus, employees respond to organizational change communication via job crafting behaviors that further enhance or hinder their adjustment to change (i.e., work engagement and adaptivity). Hypotheses are tested with a latent change score analytical approach via a three-wave longitudinal design among 368 police officers. Findings reveal that while adequate change communication is linked to increased job crafting behaviors for promotion focused employees, inadequate change communication is linked to increased job crafting behaviors for prevention focused employees. Furthermore, seeking resources is positively associated with employee work engagement, seeking challenges is positively associated with adaptivity, and reducing demands is negatively associated with work engagement. These findings bring together three different streams of literature (i.e., organizational change, regulatory focus, and job crafting). Implications for management are outlined, and they are, thereafter, translated to a specific workplace intervention, which is proposed to organizations and managers.","['change management', 'positive organizational behavior', 'communication', 'motivation', 'empowerment/employee involvement/participationDEMANDS-RESOURCES MODEL', 'REGULATORY FOCUS THEORY', 'LONGITUDINAL DATA', 'WORK ENGAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SELF', 'COMMUNICATION', 'METAANALYSIS', 'PREVENTION', 'MOTIVATION']","['communication', 'regulatory focus theory', 'regulatory focus theory', 'regulatory focus theory', 'work engagement', 'work engagement', 'communication', 'prevention']",adjustment regulatory focus work engagement

"In this study, we consider the dynamics of crowdfunding project support over time. We propose that people support crowdfunding projects financially when they believe that their contribution will make an impact. Because perceptions of impact are positively related to goal proximity, we predict that support for a crowdfunding project will increase as the project funding approaches its target goal. In addition, because motivation decreases after a goal is attained, we further predict that crowdfunding contributions will significantly decrease after the target goal is reached. We find strong support for these hypotheses from a large-scale field study involving Kickstarter. Furthermore, we show that several factors related to the expected impact moderate the effects of goal proximity; that is, the positive effect of goal proximity on project support is accentuated if the project is nearing its funding deadline, if the target goal is relatively small, or if the project has limited early support.

Those entrepreneurial firms that successfully navigate this uneven terrain appear to defy institutional constraint and create economic growth. Yet little is known about how ventures develop in unfavorable institutional environments, particularly in terms of social entrepreneurship. Contrary to the predominant view of resource mobilization, this article finds that social entrepreneurs confronted with institutional constraints engage in bricolage to reconfigure existing resources at hand. In the process, bricolage can act as a legitimating mechanism for institutional change. This article examines how regulatory, political, and technological institutions affect resource-mobilization in 202 technology social ventures from 45 countries. The implications for social entrepreneurship and for institutionally embedded entrepreneurial action are discussed.","['nanEMERGING ECONOMIES', 'LEGITIMACY', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'NETWORKS', 'VENTURES', 'FUTURE', 'CHINA', 'FIRMS', 'VIEW']","['technology', 'ventures', 'firms', 'view']",firms resource mobilization bricolage
"This study contrasts the structural perspective with the individual perspective in explaining group performance in a dynamic setting. The authors argue that these perspectives are not mutually exclusive but have different predictive powers at different group stages. Results from 45 project groups show (a) group structures provide stronger performance predictions at the later stage, whereas individual-based attributes do so at the earlier stage, and (b) different group structures and individual-based attributes provide distinctive insights at respective stages. This indicates the need to explore the potential bridge between the two perspectives in advancing group studies.","['individual perspective', 'structural perspective', 'individual-based attributes', 'group structures', 'group dynamics', 'group performanceSOCIAL NETWORKS', 'SELF-EFFICACY', 'WORK GROUPS', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL-RESEARCH', 'TASK-PERFORMANCE', 'TEAM PERFORMANCE', 'GOAL COMMITMENT', 'DIVERSITY', 'IMPACT', 'MODEL']","['individual perspective', 'individual perspective', 'structural perspective', 'structural perspective', 'individual based attributes', 'individual based attributes', 'individual based attributes', 'group structures', 'group structures']",
"This research investigated the factors that influence a decision that is often faced by employees who have made a transition from one organization to another: the decision about whether to protect secrets of their former employer or to share them with their new co-workers. A total of 111 employees from two high-tech companies participated in interviews. Their comments were analysed and, based on both relevant literature and the results of that analysis, a theory of the factors that influence newcomers' protect vs. share decisions was developed. According to that theory, newcomers first decide whether or not information is a trade secret of their former employer by considering (1) whether the information is part of their own knowledge, and (2) whether the information is publicly available, general, and negative (about something that did not work). If newcomers decide the information is a trade secret, they then evaluate (1) the degree to which their obligations are biased towards their former or new employer, and (2) the degree to which they identify more strongly with their former or new employer. Newcomers whose obligations and identifications are biased towards a new employer are more likely to share secrets. If these obligations and identifications are balanced, newcomers may share information in a way that allows them to believe they are fulfilling their responsibilities to both their former and their new employers.","['nanPSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT', 'SOCIALIZATION TACTICS', 'SELF-CATEGORIZATION', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY', 'WORK', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'OBLIGATIONS', 'ANTECEDENTS']","['work', 'identification', 'obligations']",
"How can we comprehend people who pay for an experience marketed as painful? On one hand, consumers spend billions of dollars every year to alleviate different kinds of pain. On the other hand, millions of individuals participate in extremely painful leisure pursuits. In trying to understand this conundrum, we ethnographically study a popular adventure challenge where participants subject themselves to electric shocks, fire, and freezing water. Through sensory intensification, pain brings the body into sharp focus, allowing individuals to rediscover their corporeality. In addition, painful extraordinary experiences operate as regenerative escapes from the self. By flooding the consciousness with gnawing unpleasantness, pain provides a temporary relief from the burdens of self-awareness. Finally, when leaving marks and wounds, pain helps consumers create the story of a fulfilled life. In a context of decreased physicality, market operators play a major role in selling pain to the saturated selves of knowledge workers, who use pain as a way to simultaneously escape reflexivity and craft their life narrative.","['extraordinary experience', 'pain', 'embodiment', 'ethnography', 'sociology of consumption', 'experiential consumption', 'knowledge workCONSUMER CULTURE', 'CONSUMPTION', 'EXPERIENCE', 'BODY', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MASOCHISM', 'ESCAPE', 'MARKET']","['extraordinary experience', 'extraordinary experience', 'pain', 'experience', 'body', 'escape', 'market']",experience painful knowledge
"We integrate social exchange theory with social capital theory to present a resourcebased contingency model of when team-member exchange (TMX) helps individual performance in teams. We argue that strong TMX produces obligations to utilize resources (e.g., task information) provided by one's teammates, and these obligations enhance performance when (a) teammates provide resources of high quality or (b) the quality of resources available from individuals outside of the TMX relationship (i.e., the leader) are low, purportedly because TMX-based obligations protect individuals from over-utilizing low-quality resources from the leader. We tested our model in two studies. In Study 1, multisource team data revealed that TMX enhanced member performance when teammates possessed attributes associated with high-quality resources (i.e., high cognitive ability) or when the leader did not. In Study 2, we replicated these findings in a scenario experiment, showing that TMX impacted performance under different resource conditions via felt obligation to utilize teammates' resources. Our findings advance the literature by delineating the teammate-and leader-resource conditions under which TMX benefits member performance, as well as demonstrating that felt obligation to utilize teammates' resources is an important mechanism underlying these effects. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","['nanSOCIAL-EXCHANGE', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'COGNITIVE-ABILITY', 'NETWORKS', 'LEADER', 'EXPERIENCE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'MODEL', 'PERSONALITY', 'QUALITY']","['cognitive ability', 'cognitive ability', 'leader', 'model', 'quality']",model
"Many employees in today's organizations are involved in more than one team at the same time. Building on the challenge-hindrance stressor framework, this study investigates potential benefits and disadvantages of such multiple team membership (MTM) for individual employees. Furthermore, we extend this framework with insights from the job demands-resources model to propose that, depending on an employee's organizational tenure, individual MTM will differentially shape his or her perceptions of work challenge and role ambiguity, subsequently influencing the employee's job performance and absenteeism. We tested our conceptual model using time-lagged multi-source data from a large organization of applied research (N = 1211). Our results demonstrate that, for employees with relatively low organizational tenure, MTM was negatively associated with perceived work challenge and positively associated with perceived role ambiguity, which in turn associated with lower job performance and higher absenteeism. For employees with higher organizational tenure, by contrast, MTM associated positively with their work challenge perceptions and subsequent performance outcomes, whereas MTM was unrelated to perceived role ambiguity as well as absenteeism. These findings identify relevant psychological mechanisms and a key contingency factor that explain when and why MTM may have positive or negative individual-level consequences.","['absenteeism', 'job performance', 'multiple team membership', 'organizational tenure', 'role ambiguity', 'work challengeROLE AMBIGUITY', 'ROLE-CONFLICT', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'SICK LEAVE', 'WORK', 'MODEL', 'SOCIALIZATION', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'MOTIVATION', 'EXPERIENCE']","['absenteeism', 'job performance', 'job performance', 'multiple team membership', 'multiple team membership', 'multiple team membership', 'organizational tenure', 'organizational tenure', 'role ambiguity', 'role ambiguity', 'job performance', 'job performance', 'work', 'model']",stressor team membership job demands resources model role ambiguity
"This paper attempts to understand the role of two highly relevant founder family characteristics, harmony among family members and the degree of democratization in decision-making, in the institutionalization and adaptive capability development processes of family firms in Turkey as an exemplar of an emerging market. The paper examines how institutionalization and adaptability jointly drive firm-level differences in quantitative (i.e., sales growth, market share, and return on investment) and qualitative performance (i.e., quality of goods/services, new product development, employee satisfaction) components. Data were collected from 436 respondents in 132 family firms through structured questionnaires administered to at least three respondents from each firm. Findings indicated that among the institutionalization dimensions, transparency had the strongest effect on both quantitative and qualitative firm performance, whereas adaptability influenced qualitative performance only. Harmony in family relations increased efforts for institutionalization, whereas democracy in decision-making enhanced adaptability. Implications of these findings are discussed and several future research directions are suggested. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

"This article provides a conceptual integration and synthesis of the literature on power and influence in multinational corporations (MNCs). To provide some focus to their synthesis, the authors concentrate on the situation facing, and the strategies pursued by, low-power actors within the MNC network, that is, actors who are currently positioned in relatively weak or low-status positions vis-a-vis other actors. Drawing inspiration from Ghoshal, the authors make a clear separation between ends and means: between the objectives pursued by low-power actors (their ends) and the strategies or tactics they pursue to achieve these objectives (their means). This approach allows the authors to pull together some strands of literature that had previously been entirely separate.","['power', 'influence', 'parent-subsidiary relationships', 'multinational corporations', 'literature reviewFEEDBACK-SEEKING BEHAVIOR', 'GLOBAL GOVERNANCE', 'US MULTINATIONALS', 'SELF-ENHANCEMENT', 'KNOWLEDGE FLOWS', 'STRATEGIES', 'SUBSIDIARIES', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATION', 'RESOURCE']","['power', 'influence', 'multinational corporations', 'multinational corporations', 'strategies']",power multinational corporations mncs
"Research Summary This study characterizes and tests interdependencies in corporate activities used to adjust resources and implement change. Because each activity contributes only a partial result and depends on others to complete an intended change, constraining one can create a bottleneck that traps multiple other activities. For my empirical analysis, I leverage the staggered adoptions of employment protection laws intended to constrain one specific adjustment to one specific resource: dismissing employees. The constraint, however, not only affects the contraction but also the expansion in labor as well as capital investments, acquisition, divestiture, CEO turnover, and other adjustments, and increases (shortens) the persistence of negative (positive) performance. The expansive interdependencies are critical to understanding firm rigidity and resilience, implementation failures, and the persistence of firm performance. Managerial Summary This study shows how executing even a seemingly straightforward improvement requires piecing together a series of interdependent corporate strategic activities. As a result, a constraint on just one is sufficient to foil a successful firm response. Using changes in employment laws, I show that a firm's ability to dismiss employees not only affects firing, but also hiring, capital investments, acquisition, divestiture, and CEO turnover, and increases (shortens) the persistence of negative (positive) performance. Underestimating the complex and interdependent nature of these activities can lead to bias-for-action and contribute to implementation failures, such as cost overruns, schedule delays, and a post-merger integration process that fails to realize expected synergies.","['adaptation', 'corporate strategy', 'employment protection', 'interdependencies', 'rigidityWRONGFUL-DISCHARGE LAWS', 'EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'FIRM', 'INNOVATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'COSTS', 'ACQUISITIONS', 'COMPLEMENTARITIES', 'HETEROGENEITY']","['employment protection', 'employment protection', 'interdependencies', 'employment protection', 'employment protection', 'firm', 'performance']",resources change employment protection ceo turnover
"Applying attribution theory to consumer behavior issues is quite common. In the managerial arena, previous research suggests that salespeople's attribution processes affect their expectancies for success and future behavior. However, no published research has developed adequate measures that might be used to examine the full range of attributional responses for sales success or failure and the behaviors that are likely to follow such attributions. The goal of this research is to develop a complete set of attributional and behavioral scales for sales success and failure and validate such scales in a real-world context-among field sales representatives. Following Churchill's (1979) recommended process, the authors develop a complete set of attributional and behavioral intention scales that is applicable to a field sales force setting. The authors then measure 228 financial services representatives' performance attributions for a previous sales interaction; their intended behaviors for a future, similar selling situation; and their personal characteristics. The authors test the validities of the scales and examine the usefulness of applying the scales within a theoretically justified nomological network of relationships.","['nanACHIEVEMENT-MOTIVATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EXPECTANCY', 'EMOTION', 'MODELS']",['performance'],consumer behavior attributions
"This study investigated the informal networks of white and minority managers. Minority managers had more racially heterogeneous and fewer intimate network relationships. Within the minority group, differences in advancement potential were associated with different network configurations: high-potential individuals balanced same- and cross-race contacts; others had networks dominated by ties to whites. High-potential minorities also had more contacts outside their groups, fewer high-status ties, and less overlap between their social and instrumental circles. Relative to whites, minority managers viewed similar network characteristics as providing less access to career benefits.","['nanPERSONAL NETWORKS', 'WOMEN', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'MINORITIES', 'MANAGEMENT', 'DEMOGRAPHY', 'WORK', 'MEN']","['minorities', 'work', 'men']",networks race

"Capturing the value of industrial services is an issue of growing concern as services increasingly define manufacturing companies' competitive market positions. In business markets, suppliers often create customized service packages (CSPs) to avoid difficult pricing decisions or tedious negotiations. However, using a unique dataset of responses from more than 450 managers collected through telephone-assisted online questionnaires, this study shows that the managerial practice is suboptimal. Customers' willingness to pay for CSPs is almost 5% lower than it would be with separate assessments of the same service elements, which represents substantially lower value capture potential. Buying firms with strong purchasing power demand greater price discounts for CSPs, though the presentation format has less influence among large and experienced buyers, as long as services support customer processes. Switching from CSPs to separate service offerings can enhance supplier profitability, but it requires advanced marketing capabilities to understand, document, and communicate customer value in business markets.","['Industrial services', 'Customized service packages', 'Willingness to payPRODUCT BUNDLES', 'DECISION', 'TRANSITION', 'BUYERS', 'ORIENTATIONS', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'OFFERINGS', 'SALES', 'MODEL']","['industrial services', 'industrial services', 'customized service packages', 'customized service packages', 'customized service packages', 'decision', 'buyers', 'offerings']",industrial services service customer value
"A sample of 123 independent new ventures was classified into four industry growth/strategic breadth categories. High growth industry environments were found to provide a favorable environment for new ventures to achieve sales growth; however, the highest sales growth rates were exhibited by new ventures pursuing broad breath strategies in high growth industries. One-way ANOVA and contrast tests were also used to identify whether specific strategic variables varied across the four industry growth/strategic breadth combinations. New ventures in high growth industries chose to enter on a larger, more aggressive scale and placed more emphasis on new product development than those entering low growth industries. Broad breath strategy ventures had higher levels of advertising and promotion expenses and placed greater emphasis on the dominance of marketing expertise in their top management team, developing new channels of distribution, and on brand name recognition. Ventures pursuing focus strategies emphasized specialty products and were less cost conscious.","['NEW VENTURES', 'INDUSTRY GROWTH', 'FOCUS STRATEGY', 'BREADTH', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIPPRODUCT LIFE-CYCLE', 'BUSINESS STRATEGY', 'SHARE BUSINESSES', 'START-UP', 'SUCCESS', 'MARKETS', 'PATTERNS', 'ENTRY']","['new ventures', 'new ventures', 'industry growth', 'industry growth', 'breadth']",strategies product development
"Although word-of-mouth (WOM) activity has been studied as an outcome variable of other constructs such as satisfaction, less attention has been given to the antecedents and moderators of WOM when considering WOM as a central construct. Hence, we propose a model of WOM antecedents and moderators using a meta-analytic review. The results show that all antecedents have significant effects on WOM activity, with customer commitment showing the strongest effect. The following hypotheses are also supported: (1) WOM valence is a significant moderator, (2) cross-sectional studies show a stronger influence of satisfaction and loyalty on WOM activity than longitudinal studies, and (3) studies of WOM behavior show a weaker link between loyalty and WOM activity than studies of WOM intentions. In addition, we show that satisfaction has a stronger relationship with positive WOM than loyalty, whereas (dis)loyalty has a stronger relationship with negative WOM than does (dis)satisfaction. We discuss this finding based on the different natures of positive and negative WOM.","['Word-of-mouth activity', 'Word-of-mouth valence', 'Antecedents', 'Moderators', 'Meta-analysisCONSUMER SATISFACTION', 'SERVICE QUALITY', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'AFFECTIVE RESPONSES', 'PERCEIVED JUSTICE', 'SWITCHING COSTS', 'META-ANALYSIS', 'TRUST', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'LOYALTY']","['antecedents', 'moderators', 'loyalty']",word of mouth satisfaction customer commitment
"Many consumer price promotions (including new product launches) offer a product for free or for a low, discounted price along with a required purchase. This research demonstrates that consumers' willingness to pay for the product after the promotion is retracted is higher when it was offered for free than when it was offered at a low, discounted price. The underlying reasoning is that the price of the product on promotion is used as a natural anchor for value estimation. However, when the product is offered for free (i.e., zero price), consumers are less likely to consider the value of the product and are influenced by anchors such as the price of the focal purchase. In contrast to some prior findings, a free offer does not devalue the product at all and, at a minimum, devalues the product less than if it were offered for a low, discounted price.","['nanWILLINGNESS-TO-PAY', 'PRICE', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'ANCHORS', 'BRAND']","['price', 'anchors']",price promotions willingness to pay
"According to the conventional view of MNE-host country relations, MNEs faced with political risk condition their strategic responses on each party's relative power positions - or bargaining influence. Drawing insight from network theory, institutional theory, and international relations research, I argue that firm sensitivity to political risk is contingent upon a complementary concept: social influence. Social influence arises through the mutual embeddedness of MNE and host government in a complex global network of nations. To test my hypotheses, I construct a global network of trade relations that I combine with a unique transaction-level dataset from the global petroleum industry. My results demonstrate that social influence, as modeled by home-host structural equivalence, moderates the effects of political risk. Further, my findings provide support for a conceptual and empirical distinction between social influence and the traditional bargaining influence examined in the literature.","['MNE-host country relations', 'social influence', 'bargaining', 'transparency', 'political risk', 'network analysisEXPROPRIATION RISK', 'DETERMINANTS', 'STATE', 'INSTITUTIONS', 'INVESTMENT', 'MODEL', 'POWER', 'TRANSPARENCY', 'EMBEDDEDNESS', 'CENTRALITY']","['mne host country relations', 'mne host country relations', 'mne host country relations', 'mne host country relations', 'social influence', 'social influence', 'bargaining', 'political risk', 'political risk', 'model', 'power', 'embeddedness']",political risk power bargaining influence
"Maintaining robust cooperation in interfirm strategic alliances poses special problems. Such relationships have received growing attention in recent research grounded in game theory, which has suggested that some alliance structures are inherently more likely than others to be associated with high opportunity to cheat, high behavioral uncertainty, and poor stability, longevity, and performance. The present study merged these theoretical insights with the logic of transaction cost economics in a general model of alliance structuring and tested it with data from ill interfirm alliances. Findings generally supported the model and hypotheses, suggesting the need for a greater focus on game theoretic structural dimensions and institutional responses to perceived opportunism in the study of voluntary interfirm cooperation.","['nanJOINT VENTURES', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'DETERMINANTS', 'OPPORTUNISM', 'FUTURE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'SATISFACTION', 'INTEGRATION', 'DEPENDENCE']","['performance', 'opportunism']",performance model

"Teenagers may engage in consumption behaviors that their parents may not approve of as one way of asserting independence. Such behaviors may lead teens to attempt to deceive their parents about purchases. This research examined teens' tendency toward such deception. The authors conceptualize deception as being related to the family communication environment and the shopping context in which it takes place. Some family communication environments may stifle open discussion of products and put-chases, thereby encouraging teen deception. Moreover certain patterns of family communication may socialize teens to focus on standards exogenous to the family that, in turn, lead to a greater propensity to deceive. Susceptibility to normative peer influence, the extent of television viewing, and teen materialism may partially mediate the effects of the family communication environment. Except for television viewing, the authors' predictions are generally supported by the data collected from a sample of high school students.","['adolescents', 'deception', 'family communication environment', 'socialization', 'purchase contextCONSUMER-SOCIALIZATION', 'FAMILY COMMUNICATION', 'ADOLESCENT CONSUMER', 'INTERPERSONAL INFLUENCES', 'TELEVISION', 'CHILDREN', 'SUSCEPTIBILITY', 'DELINQUENCY', 'ORIENTATION', 'BEHAVIORS']","['deception', 'family communication environment', 'family communication environment', 'family communication environment', 'family communication', 'family communication', 'television', 'susceptibility', 'behaviors']",teenagers behaviors deception communication materialism

Based on a cross-sectional sample of more than 700 JVs involving American firms and non-American partners, this study finds that the structure of JVs varies significantly across-sponsor categories. These differences reveal themselves in terms of American firms' differential market performance. Moreover, some JV characteristics consistently influence firms' shareholder value whereas the impact of other characteristics depends upon a particular sponsor category. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

"The rapid development of augmented reality (AR) is reshaping retail frontline operations by enhancing the offline and online customer experience. Drawing on mental imagery theory, this paper develops a conceptual framework to reflect how AR emulates customer's cognitive processes offloading those to the technology. Consequently, the AR-enabled frontline improves decision comfort, motivates positive WOM and facilitates choice of higher value products. The underlying mechanism is a sequential mediation via improved processing fluency and decision comfort. The findings also demonstrate boundary conditions of customers' visual processing styles and product contextuality. Object-visualisers benefit more from AR induced imagery processes, and the effect of processing fluency on customer decision comfort is moderated by product contextuality. The results are verified with repeat studies to control for novelty of AR, and a field study that highlights the impact of AR on customers' choice and spending. We discuss implications for theory and practice of AR-enabled frontline retailing. (C) 2019 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Managing the distribution channel is a key concern to firms operating in the world's largest developing economy. This study examines channel exchange relationships in China using data on department stores' relationship with their tenants. The power-satisfaction-commitment-performance framework was used as a basis for the study. Department stores' contingent use of coercive power was found to have little or no effect on their tenants' economic and social satisfaction, which suggests that coercive power is perceived as 'legitimate' by small and medium-sized retailers in China. Tenants' behavior towards power also reflects a subtle difference in channel member behavior, which reflects the differences between China's collectivistic culture and the individualistic culture in many Western countries. This study adds to the existing knowledge on channel behavior in Chinese cultural setting. In addition, it tests the degree of cross-cultural generalization of established channel constructs. It also provides managerial insights on channel relationship management in China's market. (c) 2005 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"The authors examine how a service firm's longevity may affect consumers' perceptions of risk in conducting business with the firm. Depending on the nature of information available to consumers, a firm's longevity can act in one of two ways to reduce the consumers' perceived risk: (1) Longevity may act as an extrinsic cue of the firm's quality, or (2) availability of a longer track record of an older firm may allow consumers to make more precise prediction of the firm's future quality. The authors develop a set of hypotheses that relate these two effects to consumers' preferences and test them in a series of four experiments. They find that a firm's age can act as an extrinsic cue of the firm's quality. When consumers also have information about firms' intrinsic attributes, the effect of a firm's age as an extrinsic cue is diminished under conditions of high involvement. The experiments also show that consumers prefer firms with longer track records, especially when firms' performance/quality levels are subject to more variability. However, when consumers have high aspiration levels, they prefer firms with shorter track records, even though the consumers perceive these firms as riskier choices.","['services', 'marketing strategy', 'advertising', 'risk', 'consumer behaviorPERCEIVED RISK', 'SERVICE QUALITY', 'MODEL', 'INFORMATION', 'BRAND', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'CUES', 'PREFERENCES', 'WARRANTY', 'PRICE']","['risk', 'information', 'perceptions', 'preferences']",choices
"In a departure from prior studies presuming a beneficial experience effect in foreign direct investment (FDI), the present paper examines the conditions under which FDI experience may actually harm subsequent subsidiaries. We argue that multinational enterprises (MNEs) may draw erroneous inferences and learn incorrectly from their early expansions when new to a dissimilar culture, because their learning abilities are eroded by cultural differences. We posit that the characteristics of an MNE's international expansion, including scope, pace, rhythm, and entry mode, moderate this negative experience effect by influencing the MNE's learning ability in foreign cultures. Using a data set of FDIs by South Korean MNEs between 1990 and 2006, we find a positive relationship between subsidiary mortality and experience when an MNE has a low level of experience in a dissimilar culture. This relationship is weaker if the MNE's prior FDI has been dispersed across different cultures, is stronger if it expanded internationally at a fast pace, and becomes negative once the MNE has accumulated a high level of experience in the host culture. We conclude that, when expanding into dissimilar cultures, MNEs must establish mechanisms to mitigate incorrect learning and reexamine the correctness of inferences drawn from past experience before applying them.

"Based on data from Maxham and Netemeyer [Maxham, J. G. and R. G. Netemeyer (2003). Firms Reap What They Sow: The Effects of Employee Shared Values and Perceived Organizational Justice on Customer Evaluations of Complaint Handling, Journal of Marketing, 67, 46-62], the authors present two field samples to examine predictive validity differences of service employee ratings of their performance versus supervisor ratings of employee performance with respect to customer satisfaction and customer likelihood of spreading positive word-of-mouth (WOM) after a service recovery attempt. The results generally show that supervisor ratings are more strongly positively related to customer satisfaction and WOM than are employee ratings of their own performances. The results also show that both supervisor ratings and employee ratings are related to customer satisfaction and WOM in a curvilinear fashion (as well as linear fashion). Employee extra-role performances (toward customers and the firm) show increasing returns at the higher levels of performance, and employee in-role customer performance generally shows a decreasing return at the higher level of customer in-role performance. These results suggest two managerial implications. First, supervisor ratings of customer service employee performances may be the preferred form of measurement for predicting customer outcomes. Second, maximizing in-role performance inputs may have decreasing returns for customer evaluations in the service recovery context; but maximizing extra-role performance inputs may actually delight customers, i.e., increasing returns for customer evaluations.

"Understanding how private family firms gauge performance is of great interest to family business scholars. Unfortunately, finding comparable data to understand differences in the performance of such firms is challenging. This study draws from the organizational identity literature to show how private family firms communicate different goals in publicly available organizational narratives.

"Boards in early stage high tech firms have an important role to play through their involvement in service tasks. Building on the attention based view of the firm and self-efficacy theory, we investigate the role of top management team (TWIT) and board chair characteristics as antecedents of board service involvement (BSI). Studying a sample of 117 Norwegian early stage high tech firms, we find that TMT diversity positively affects BSI, whereas CEO duality negatively affects BSI. We further find that the industry experience of the board chair positively moderates the relationship between TMT size and BSI whereas CEO duality reinforces the TMT diversity-BSI relationship.

"Being proactive is about making things happen, anticipating and preventing problems, and seizing opportunities. It involves self-initiated efforts to bring about change in the work environment and/or oneself to achieve a different future. The authors develop existing perspectives on this topic by identifying proactivity as a goal-driven process involving both the setting of a proactive goal (proactive goal generation) and striving to achieve that proactive goal (proactive goal striving). The authors identify a range of proactive goals that individuals can pursue in organizations. These vary on two dimensions: the future they aim to bring about (achieving a better personal fit within one's work environment, improving the organization's internal functioning, or enhancing the organization's strategic fit with its environment) and whether the self or situation is being changed. The authors then identify can do, reason to, and energized to motivational states that prompt proactive goal generation and sustain goal striving. Can do motivation arises from perceptions of self-efficacy, control, and (low) cost. Reason to motivation relates to why someone is proactive, including reasons flowing from intrinsic, integrated, and identified motivation. Energized to motivation refers to activated positive affective states that prompt proactive goal processes. The authors suggest more distal antecedents, including individual differences (e.g., personality, values, knowledge and ability) as well as contextual variations in leadership, work design, and interpersonal climate, that influence the proactive motivational states and thereby boost or inhibit proactive goal processes. Finally, the authors summarize priorities for future research.","['proactive', 'proactivity', 'motivation', 'self-regulation', 'initiative', 'work behaviorBREADTH SELF-EFFICACY', 'FEEDBACK-SEEKING', 'CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP', 'IMPRESSION-MANAGEMENT', 'WORK CHARACTERISTICS', 'GOAL ORIENTATION', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'POSITIVE AFFECT', 'BEHAVIOR', 'PERSONALITY']","['proactive', 'proactivity', 'motivation', 'positive affect', 'positive affect', 'personality']",efficacy personality
"In this study, we examine how the relationship between the level of strategic change in the pattern of resource allocation and firm performance differs between firms led by outside CEOs and those led by inside CEOs. Based on longitudinal data air the tenure histories of 193 CEOs who left office between 1993 and 1998, we find that the level of strategic change hers air inverted U-shaped relationship with firm performance. As the level of change increases from slight to moderate, performance increases; as the level of change increases from moderate to great, performance declines. Further, we find that this inverted U-shaped relationship differs between firms led by outside CEOs and those led by inside CEOs. That is, both the positive effect of strategic change on firm performance when the level of change is relatively low and the negative effect of strategic change on firm performance when the level of change is relatively high are more pronounced for outside CEOs than for inside CEOs. Supplementary analyses also suggest that this difference between outside and inside CEOs exists in later years but not in the early years of CEO tenure.

"Dual-earner couples are increasingly prevalent and encounter demands arising from each partner's commitment to various work and life domains. Unfortunately, there has been little theoretical progress in explaining how dual-earner couples navigate work-life shock events, which we define as disruptive, novel, and critical events that require investment of a couple's resources. Drawing from identity and sensemaking theories, we develop a theory of work-life shock events to explain how dual-earner couples perceive and respond to these events. We theorize that partners initially make sense of the event as individuals and then engage in couple-level sensemaking. We argue that each individual's shock intensity perceptions are shaped by the shock event's characteristics and the identity factors of role salience hierarchy and future self. A subsequent couple-level process of sensemaking ensues, influenced by the salience of the originating domain and partner role, as well as relational identity factors. Couple-level shock intensity perceptions result in the couple's decision regarding resource investment in the shock event's originating domain. We discuss implications for future research and for organizations.","['nanDECISION-MAKING POWER', 'FAMILY CONFLICT', 'UNFOLDING MODEL', 'ROLE SALIENCE', 'LINKING WORK', 'IDENTITY', 'CAREER', 'GENDER', 'SELF', 'CROSSOVER']","['role salience', 'role salience', 'identity', 'self']",dual commitment sensemaking
"Sharing experiences with peers through online reviews has amplified the impacts of individual articulations on the reputations of firms across many industries. With employee review sites, current and former employees share their positive and negative experiences with their company, which has become an increasingly important aspect for reputation management and for job seekers' decision-making on where to apply. In the present study, the effects of discrepant reviews (i.e., reviews with a high variance in company evaluations) are examined in the context of employer review sites. In particular, we investigate how review discrepancy, persuasion knowledge activation, and constructive company responses affect job seekers' trust in the company and the resulting application intentions. In our preliminary study, we analyzed a sample of 25,827 published company reviews on the German employee rating site Kununu.de. The results revealed that high levels of discrepant reviews for the same company exist, thus underlining the need for additional studies. In our main study, a 2 (review discrepancy) x 2 (persuasion knowledge activation) x 2 (company response) between-subject-design experiment was conducted with 311 respondents. We find that high levels of discrepancies lead to increased intentions to avoid submitting applications to the focal company and reduced intentions to pursue employment. This study complements the research concerning online reputation by highlighting the relevance of discrepant reviews for job seekers' application intentions.

"This study empirically examines the longitudinal influences of salesperson goal orientations on performance trajectories during a planned change intervention that requires learning to answer two questions. First, what is the functional form of salespeople's performance trajectories during a period of change implementation? Second, why are some salespeople better at adapting to change than others? Polynomial growth models show that the average salesperson performance trajectory displays an initial decline, gradual recovery, and eventual restabilization. Salesperson learning orientation is related positively to larger initial declines, steeper recovery slopes, and higher restabilization levels. In contrast, performance orientation is related positively to smaller initial declines, but shallower recovery slopes and lower restabilization levels. The results suggest that successful implementation of planned change interventions largely depends on identifying and appreciating the heterogeneity of individual traits that share meaning with the change. The study has implications on what sales managers should expect in terms of performance losses and gains during change and how managers can predict which salespeople will reap the largest performance benefits from a change intervention.","['salesperson', 'organizational change', 'adaptation to change', 'goal orientation', 'growth modelingGOAL ORIENTATION', 'LEARNING ORIENTATION', 'SALESPERSON PERFORMANCE', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'MODELS', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'CAPABILITIES', 'PERSONALITY', 'MOTIVATION']","['salesperson', 'goal orientation', 'goal orientation', 'learning orientation', 'learning orientation', 'salesperson performance', 'salesperson performance', 'models', 'implementation']",goal orientations salespeople growth models
"Although there is a vast literature on employee reactions to procedural injustice, little is known about the important issue of why some managers are less procedurally just than others. In this field study we found that a manager's implicit person theory (IPT; i.e., extent of assumption that people can change) predicted employees' perceptions of the procedural justice with which their last performance appraisal was conducted. These procedural justice perceptions in turn predicted employees' organizational citizenship behavior, as partially mediated by their organizational commitment. This research provides an initial empirical basis for a new line of inquiry that extends existing IPT theory into the realm of perceptual, attitudinal, and behavioral responses to people as a function of their IPT. Other contributions to the IPT, performance appraisal, and procedural justice literatures are discussed.","['implicit person theory', 'performance appraisals', 'procedural justiceORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL ESSENTIALISM', 'PERCEIVED FAIRNESS', 'LABOR UNION', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'LEADERSHIP', 'SELF', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'EMPLOYEES', 'DECISIONS']","['implicit person theory', 'implicit person theory', 'implicit person theory', 'perceptions', 'employees']",implicit person theory performance appraisal citizenship behavior organizational commitment
"Rapid technological change can be both a blessing and a curse. For example, investors and firms of all sizes hope to reap the rewards that may arise from the apparent convergence of the computer, telecommunications, and entertainment industries. With the high level of uncertainty inherent to such rapidly changing markets, however, those potentially dazzling returns are counterbalanced by a daunting level of risk. John Mullins and Daniel Sutherland suggest that firms operating in such markets require NPD practices that can mitigate risk, manage uncertainty, and, of course, increase the likelihood of new product success. To gain insight into the NPD practices that can meet those challenges, that conducted in-depth interviews with managers who were directly involved in NPD projects at US WEST, Inc., a large, multinational firm in the telecommunications industry. The study focused our identifying practices their help the firm bring new products into rapidly changing markets quickly, efficiently, and effectively. A key objective of their study was to go beyond the basics-for example, the use of cross-functional teams-to identify specific practices that allow the firm to address the various levels of uncertainty that characterize its markets. They identify three levels of uncertainty that confront firms operating in rapidly changing markets. First, potential customers cannot easily articulate needs that a new technology may fulfill. Consequently NPD managers are uncertain about the market opportunities that a new technology offers. Second, NPD managers are uncertain about how to turn the new technologies into products that meet customer needs. This uncertainty arises, not only from customers' inability, to articulate their needs, but also from managers' difficulties in translating technological advancements into product features and benefits. Finally, senior management faces uncertainty about how much capital to invest in pursuit of rapidly changing markets as well as when to invest. The study identities six practices that help the firm address the uncertainty and risk inherent in its rapidly changing markets. For example, market research in this firm's NPD process focuses more on probing than it does on measuring. Involvement of prospective customers in idea generation and the use of prototypes early in the NPD process help the firm uncover customer needs and market opportunities. Large-scale, quantitative market research focuses primarily on determining market size and price points.","['nanPERFORMANCE', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'INNOVATION', 'SUCCESS', 'IMPACT', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'EXPERIENCE', 'STRATEGY', 'INDUSTRY', 'FAILURE']","['success', 'uncertainty', 'industry']",success
"Retailers who wish to launch new innovations into their markets can be much more effective if they understand the geographic forces which affect consumer adoption of those innovations. A research field which studies this process is spatial diffusion. This paper explores and models the processes and driving forces of spatial diffusion across a market area following the launch of a new loyalty card program by a national retailer. Event history modeling is used to estimate the effects of distance, the impact of the firm's marketing efforts, and the role of previous adopters in influencing the speed and spatial pattern of the adoption process. The results, in addition to yielding new insights into the processes involved in spatial diffusion, support previous findings on the importance of targeting the Innovator adopter group in a new product launch.

"Building on the meta-analytic model suggested by Palmatier et al. Journal of Marketing, 70, 136-153, (2006), this study extends the relationship marketing framework to the domain of online retailing to identify what strategies help build relationships with online customers. Specifically, this meta-analytic study identifies key antecedents and consequences of relationship marketing in online retailing. The study also examines the relationship between the four mediators-trust, commitment, relationship quality, and relationship satisfaction-and the antecedents and consequences of relationship marketing. Similarity and seller expertise were found to have the strongest impact on relational mediators, and word of mouth was the most critical outcome of relationship marketing efforts. The model proffered in this study will motivate hypotheses to be examined by future researchers.

"Servant leadership is positioned as a new field of research for leadership scholars. This review deals with the historical background of servant leadership, its key characteristics, the available measurement tools, and the results of relevant studies that have been conducted so far. An overall conceptual model of servant leadership is presented. It is argued that leaders who combine their motivation to lead with a need to serve display servant leadership. Personal characteristics and culture are positioned alongside the motivational dimension. Servant leadership is demonstrated by empowering and developing people; by expressing humility, authenticity, interpersonal acceptance, and stewardship; and by providing direction. A high-quality dyadic relationship, trust, and fairness are expected to be the most important mediating processes to encourage self-actualization, positive job attitudes, performance, and a stronger organizational focus on sustainability and corporate social responsibility.","['servant leadership', 'review', 'positive organizational behaviorSELF-SACRIFICIAL LEADERSHIP', 'MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'AUTHENTIC LEADERSHIP', 'FOLLOWERS', 'BEHAVIORS', 'ATTITUDES', 'IMPACT', 'TEAMS', 'MODEL', 'TRUST']","['servant leadership', 'servant leadership', 'review', 'attitudes', 'model', 'trust']",servant leadership motivation
"Because co-creation allows customers to help shape or personalize the content of their experience, it can affect customer satisfaction with recovery efforts, as well as offer a more cost-effective alternative to compensation. This article identifies specific situations in which co-creation is and is not useful. Study 1 tests the impact of co-creation in comparison with compensation for enhancing satisfaction with the recovery process and demonstrates that co-creation offers a cost-efficient strategy for companies when customers must deal with severe delays. Study 2 extends these results by showing that the impact extends to repurchase intentions. Study 3 details conditions in which co-creation harms evaluations. Finally, Study 4 explores whether it is necessary for the company to meet the customer's requests when co-creating a recovery, as well as what happens when the company exceeds a customer's requests.

"The concept of developing sustainable consumption practices has been a factor for discussion within academic literature for nearly half a decade. Many have argued the consequences of unmonitored consumption practices within a 'throw-away' society would lead to environmental, social and economic degeneration. With consumption no longer hindered by global boundaries, there is an emergence of a common class of people within society consuming in vast amounts, over great distances from one another, and reaps irreparable environmental damage. The onus of developing sustainable practice is no longer the sole responsibility of economies of affluence and specific segments of our economy but has become the responsibility of all stakeholders. Using a triangulated qualitative approach, the aim of this research is to advance our understanding and definition of sustainability in the key stakeholder group: The young consumers, Y generation. The research will focus on understanding their consumption footprints and their view of the notion of sustainability. Implications for social changes, policy and practice will also be presented.

"Purpose - Inter-firm knowledge sharing and learning constitute one of the main avenues to improve supply chains' performance in today's business environment. This paper aims to examine how effective different governance mechanisms are in promoting knowledge transfer, learning and performance in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach - Following on from the literature in inter-organizational learning, transaction costs economics, business-to-business relational marketing, and supply chain management, a model is presented and tested using structural equations modeling. Data were collected from 219 Colombian apparel manufacturers. Findings - This paper finds that from more influential to less, social mechanisms of governance, hostages and behavioral control favor knowledge sharing, learning and performance in supply chains. Output control exerts a negative influence on learning in supply chains. Research limitations/implications - Governance has a key role in promoting transparency and learning in supply chains. Future research should analyze whether it impacts on the firms' learning intent. Practical implications - Knowledge sharing and learning have a positive influence on the supply chain's performance. Results of the study suggest that the supply chain's competitiveness lies in the adequate governance of the interfirm relationships, i.e. by using trust, hostages and behavioral control to support knowledge exchange. Originality/value - Compared with studies that limit their analysis to the impact of one specific type of governance mechanism, generally trust, the paper for the first time jointly examines the role of several types of governance on knowledge-sharing in supply chains, on learning and on performance. This allows a comparison of the different mechanisms in terms of their safeguarding and coordination role.","['Knowledge management', 'Learning', 'Performance management', 'Governance', 'Textile industryMARKET ORIENTATION', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'POWER REGIMES', 'TRUST', 'OPPORTUNISM', 'MANAGEMENT', 'COMMITMENT', 'MECHANISMS', 'BUYER', 'INTEGRATION']","['learning', 'governance', 'trust', 'management', 'mechanisms']",governance knowledge transfer organizational learning chain management hostages behavioral control impacts
"This study proposes a frontline learning process by which organizations capture new knowledge generated by frontline employees in addressing productivity-quality tradeoffs during customer interactions and transform it into updated knowledge for frontline use. Updated knowledge, in turn, is posited to influence customer satisfaction and financial outcomes (i.e., revenue, efficiency). Empirical testing with multi-source data reveals that: (1) knowledge articulation mediates the transformation of knowledge generated in the frontlines into updated knowledge, (2) updated frontline knowledge positively impacts customer and financial outcomes, and (3) frontline employee workload inhibits the transformational process unless it is at an intermediate level (inverted U-effect), while employee goal convergence bolsters it linearly.","['Frontline learning', 'Service revenue', 'Customer satisfactionHEALTH-CARE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'SERVICE QUALITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'IMPACT', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'ORIENTATION', 'CAPABILITIES', 'INNOVATION']","['frontline learning', 'frontline learning', 'customer satisfaction', 'customer satisfaction', 'impact', 'productivity']",frontline learning customer satisfaction impacts workload
"The present study investigates consumer responses to price-matching guarantees (PMGs) in the Internet environment and contrasts them with their responses in a traditional bricks-and-mortar retail environment. The effect of store reputation on consumer responses to price-matching policies is also investigated in both Internet and bricks-and-mortar retail settings. Two studies using a 2 x 2 x 2 between-subjects full factorial experimental design with two levels of PMG presence (PMG present, PMG absent), two levels of retail environment (Internet, bricks-and-mortar), and two levels of store reputation (no/low reputation, high reputation) were conducted. In study 1 reputation was manipulated using store names, while in study 2 the reputation was manipulated using store characteristics. The findings of two studies suggest that consumer reactions to price-matching guarantees, such as store price perceptions, postpurchase search intentions, and willingness to claim a refund if a lower competitive price is found, differ across the two purchase environments.","['price matching', 'retailing', 'price perceptions', 'searchPERCEPTIONS', 'REFUND', 'BEHAVIOR']","['price matching', 'price matching', 'price perceptions', 'price perceptions', 'refund']",price matching guarantees internet store reputation search

"Research Summary: Corporate philanthropy has long been recognized as an important part of multinational strategy, yet we know relatively little how charitable giving is allocated across countries. Using a sample of 208 U.S.-based corporate foundations from 1993 to 2008, we find that the foundations give more in countries with opaque institutional environments, but they do so through international intermediaries. They also give more when the funding firms have new entries in countries with weak institutions-hence greater needs for the social license to operate-or when their operations require stronger connections with local suppliers or customers. These findings point to the use of corporate philanthropy as part of corporate diplomacy when the local institutions are ineffective and the importance of reaching out to local constituents is high. Managerial Summary: Corporate foundations play an important role in firms' charitable giving across countries. This article analyzes how foundation giving is associated with the funding firm's need to navigate the local business environments. Using a sample of 208 U.S.-based corporate foundations from 1993 to 2008, we find that foundations give more in countries characterized by weak rule of law and high levels of corruption, and when the funding firms have newly established subsidiaries or stronger need to connect with local stakeholders there. However, donations to countries with weak institutions are more likely to go through international intermediaries to avoid potential liabilities. The results are consistent with the view that corporate foundations support corporate diplomacy and help obtain the social license to operate in the host countries.","['corporate foundations', 'corporate philanthropy', 'institutional environment', 'multinational enterprises', 'multinational strategiesSOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PHILANTHROPY', 'CORRUPTION', 'EXPERIENCE', 'COUNTRIES']","['corporate foundations', 'corporate foundations', 'corporate philanthropy', 'corporate philanthropy', 'institutional environment', 'institutional environment', 'philanthropy', 'corruption', 'countries']",corporate philanthropy institutions
"The present research sheds new light on the antecedents and outcomes of bidders' perceived risk. It examines the role of the two-system model in the context of activating the potential to either win or lose an online auction. This study demonstrates that when a bidder's affective system is primed, concern about losing the item is greater and ultimately the bid amount is higher when the bidder expects to lose rather than win. Conversely, when the cognitive system is primed, the anticipated goals of winning the auction - rather than the fear of losing - drive the bidder's actions. In the latter case, the bidder pays a higher amount if the expectancy of winning is primed, as opposed to the expectancy of losing. A field study on eBay and two lab studies confirm this phenomenon.

Unfortunately, in their current review published in this issue, they outlined how little, if any, of their thoughtful guidance was taken to heart. In our perspective, we believe that this signals that the study and use of culture in the international business field has become stuck in a theoretical and methodological rut and more radical thinking is necessary if we are going to advance beyond more of the same'' science that simply reiterates repeatedly that that culture matters without any coherent advancement of the key role that it plays in the international arena.","['culture', 'theory development', 'empirical measurement', 'Decade AwardINTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MICROFOUNDATIONS', 'COCITATION', 'DISTANCE', 'VALUES']",['culture'],consequences
"New ventures are frequently started by entrepreneurial teams rather than lone entrepreneurs. Often, team members have family ties. Yet, there has been relatively little research on new venture and family business teams. The papers in this special issue address this gap by studying team formation and composition, faultlines among team members, generational involvement in teams, the influence of shared organizational experience and functional homogeneity, and the likelihood of couples, biologically related, and unrelated teams achieving first sales. Combined, they suggest that relationships are more important than skill diversity in determining the effectiveness of both family business and new venture teams.","['nanTOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS', 'NONFAMILY EMPLOYEES', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'CONFLICT', 'DYNAMICS', 'HETEROGENEITY', 'ORGANIZATION', 'FAULTLINES', 'COHESION']","['organization', 'faultlines']",
"Why do firms go abroad when technology makes it possible to do business at a distance? We argue that the cost of distance differentially affects investment motivations across industries. We find support for this hypothesis in a study of U.S. inward and outward FDI. Knowledge seeking and efficiency seeking are the two most important explanations for international activity in information-intensive industries, reinforcing the value of intangible resources in this sphere. In less information-intensive industries, market seeking and the search for low-cost export platforms are the dominant motivations for FDI. An important implication for the current debate on offshoring is that inward FDI flows into the United States occur in high-rather than low-paying industries, and are of the knowledge-seeking variety, while outward flows are driven by the search for efficiency and markets.

"Prior research has shown that exerting self-control can lead to increased aggression. In the present research, we find that exerting self-control is associated with angry behavior more broadly. In particular, using a matched-choice paradigm, we find that after exerting self-control people exhibit increased preference for anger-themed content, greater interest in faces exhibiting anger, greater endorsement of anger-framed appeals, and greater irritation to others' attempts to control their behavior. We speculate on the possible mechanisms underlying these effects and discuss the theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of this research.","['nanEGO-DEPLETION', 'UNRESTRAINED EATERS', 'FACIAL EXPRESSION', 'LIMITED RESOURCE', 'EATING BEHAVIOR', 'ANGER', 'JUDGMENT', 'EMOTION', 'SADNESS', 'CHOICE']","['anger', 'choice']",

"Research summary We examine the advancement of women in executive roles in the ranks of the 10 highest executive positions in the Fortune 100 companies in 2001 and 2011. We find that women executives secured top executive positions faster than men, controlling for relevant individual attributes, and that the advantage of women with respect to men grew with the number of years they spent in the organization. The female advantage disappeared once companies had more than one high-ranking female executive. We make use of several tests to assess possible unobserved differences between men and women executives, including the case-control technique from epidemiology. Our results are consistent with institutional pressures accelerating women's advancement to top executive positions, but they also reveal the limited effectiveness of such pressures. Managerial summary Employers interested in increasing the diversity of their executive ranks should pay attention not only to who is in those jobs but also how long it took them to get there. In our study, women in top jobs got there faster not just because they were better but because they moved through previous positions faster and skipped steps in job ladders. This suggests how diversity at the top can be enhanced without having to wait for more diverse cohorts in lower-level jobs to slowly advance. The fact that faster advancement slowed once there were a few women in top jobs suggests that support for advancement was indeed a company choice, unfortunately one driven by public appearances.","['career advancement', 'gender', 'institutionalism', 'promotions', 'top executivesORGANIZATIONAL-STRUCTURE', 'CORPORATE BOARDS', 'SEX-DIFFERENCES', 'GLASS CLIFF', 'WOMEN', 'MANAGEMENT', 'DIVERSITY', 'PROMOTION', 'FEMALE', 'CEO']","['women', 'diversity', 'female']",diversity
"We develop a capabilities-based theory of acquirer target selection, arguing that acquirers will pursue both low capability targets in existing contexts to deploy existing capabilities, and high capability targets in new contexts to acquire new capabilities. These arguments are formalized in an analytical model that jointly considers the benefits and costs of acquisition as a function of target capability level and context. The predictions from this model are tested in the Chinese brewing industry (1998-2007), with results showing that acquirers strongly prefer inferior targets in existing geographic markets, but are relatively more likely to choose superior targets in new markets, especially if they have strong acquisition capabilities. Our study provides insight into the factors driving target selection, and contributes to a capabilities-based understanding of acquisitions.

"Drawing on institutional theory, this study examines the question of how host country institutions affect corporate social responsibility (CSR) adoption by multinational enterprises (MNEs). I propose that CSR encompasses a set of practices that MNEs draw on to signal legitimacy in different kinds of institutional contexts - contexts that vary in how they shape issue salience and stakeholder power in a given issue field. Building on ideas related to field opacity and the managerial implications of CSR, I study why MNEs adopt two distinct types of CSR policies: standards-based CSR in response to contexts marked by issue salience, and rights-based CSR in response to contexts marked by stakeholder power. To test these hypotheses, I use subsidiary and firm-level data from a sample of 540 Western European MNEs in the issue field of labor rights. Results show that MNEs strategically adopt these CSR policies related to their presence in distinct institutional contexts. The study offers implications for how MNEs manage the legitimacy of their global operations and how CSR, as a form of private governance, can emerge as both a substitute and complement to regulatory institutions.","['neoinstitutional theory', 'corporate social responsibility', 'foreign direct investment', 'labor practices', 'MNE-host-country relations', 'logistic regressionCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS', 'HUMAN-RIGHTS', 'EMERGING MARKETS', 'LABOR RIGHTS', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSES', 'INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'STAKEHOLDER PRESSURE']","['corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'labor rights', 'labor rights']",csr firm labor rights private governance

This study develops and supports a framework suggesting that firms with positive changes in customer satisfaction are more attractive to transient institutional investors than to non-transient institutional investors. We also find that the impact of customer satisfaction on transient institutional investor holdings is contingent upon firm intangible asset intensity, product-market demand uncertainty, and financial market volatility. In addition, transient institutional investor holdings at least partially mediate the effects of changes in customer satisfaction on firm abnormal return and idiosyncratic risk. Thus, transient institutional investor investments represent a mechanism through which customer satisfaction affects firm value.","['Customer satisfaction', 'Investor community', 'Institutional investor holding', 'Intangibles', 'Marketing-finance interfaceRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'WORD-OF-MOUTH', 'STOCK RETURNS', 'MARKET', 'EARNINGS', 'INFORMATION', 'OWNERSHIP', 'ANALYST', 'EQUITY', 'IMPACT']","['customer satisfaction', 'customer satisfaction', 'institutional investor holding', 'institutional investor holding', 'institutional investor holding', 'market', 'information', 'impact']",customer satisfaction institutional investors
"Employee stock-ownership plans (ESOPs) offered by multinational enterprises (MNEs) present an attractive investment for employees. Puzzlingly, participation rates are often low, raising the question what drives ESOP participation on a global scale. Grounded in the knowledge-based view of expatriate research, we build on the notion of expatriates as implicit knowledge transferors within MNEs. We hypothesize a positive effect of expatriate ESOP participation on subsidiary-employee ESOP participation, which is even higher when a subsidiary employee's distance toward the program and the firm is greater. Empirical results confirm our hypotheses suggesting that expatriates can be a mechanism to bridge the distance within MNEs.","['Employee stock-ownership plans', 'Expatriates', 'Distance', 'Subsidiaries', 'Knowledge-based viewSTOCK-OWNERSHIP PLANS', 'SHARE OWNERSHIP', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'INTERNATIONAL ASSIGNEES', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP', 'INSTITUTIONAL DISTANCE', 'CONCEPTUAL-MODEL']","['employee stock ownership plans', 'employee stock ownership plans', 'employee stock ownership plans', 'employee stock ownership plans', 'expatriates', 'distance', 'knowledge transfer', 'knowledge transfer']",stock ownership plans multinational enterprises knowledge based view expatriate distance
"Marketers are increasingly allowing consumers to sample sensory-rich experiential products before making purchase decisions. The results of seven experimental studies (two conducted in field settings, three conducted in a laboratory, and two conducted online) demonstrate that the order in which consumers sample products and the level of (dis)similarity between the sensory cues of the products influence choices. In the absence of any moderators, when sampling a sequence of sensory-rich experiential products (e.g., fragrances, chocolates, flavored beverages, music) with similar sensory cues (e.g., smell, taste, color, sound), consumers prefer the first product in the sequence. However, when sampling a sequence of products with dissimilar sensory cues, consumers prefer the last product. These findings (1) contribute to a better understanding of the role of sequential sensory cues on consumer choice formation, (2) have implications for effects related to sensory habituation and sensory trace fading, and (3) help resolve apparent inconsistencies in prior research on order effects in the context of choices for sequentially sampled experiential products.","['sensory cues', 'sequential and order effects', 'sampling', 'sensory habituation and traces', 'retail displaysCONTRAST', 'ORDER', 'DISTRACTIONS', 'ASSIMILATION', 'HABITUATION', 'CONSUMPTION', 'INTERPLAY', 'VARIETY', 'ODORS']","['sensory cues', 'sensory cues', 'sampling', 'order', 'habituation']",experiential products habituation
"Research Summary: In this article, we explore how keynote speeches come into being as a staged genre of strategic communication. In our critical discursive analysis of video data on Apple Inc.'s keynote speeches, we demonstrate how keynote speeches are multimodally accomplished through the embodied enactment of four discursive practices: referencing, relating, demarcating, and mystifying. We show how different bodily movements, which we describe as leveling and leaping gestures, systematically contribute to constructing different conceptions of strategy through the enactment of these discursive practices as a staged genre of strategic communication. Our findings contribute to strategy-as-practice research by extending the nascent but growing literature on genres of strategic communication, the strategist's body in the strategy process, and the use of video-based research methods. Managerial Summary: Firms increasingly rely on keynote speeches to communicate their strategies. As a result, managers invest more and more time and effort into preparing and rehearsing their keynote speeches. But how do managers communicate strategy in these staged performances? Based on an analysis of Apple Inc.'s keynote speeches, we explore the discursive and bodily patterns that characterize this genre. In doing so, we demonstrate that the coordinated use of bodily movements in keynote speeches is consequential for highlighting different aspects of the communicated strategy. This shows that keynote speeches and other types of public speeches cannot simply be scripted, but require managers to engage in bodily rehearsal and training in order to communicate strategies effectively.","['critical discursive analysis', 'genre of strategic communication', 'multimodality', 'strategy as practice', 'video methodsDISCOURSE ANALYSIS', 'POWER', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PRESENTATIONS', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'LEGITIMATION', 'ORGANIZATION', 'CONTEXT', 'WORK']","['critical discursive analysis', 'critical discursive analysis', 'critical discursive analysis', 'genre of strategic communication', 'genre of strategic communication', 'genre of strategic communication', 'genre of strategic communication', 'strategy as practice', 'strategy as practice', 'strategy as practice']",keynote speeches strategic communication video movements practice
"Research summary: We revisit the empirical relationship between multinationality and performance by attempting to replicate the widely cited S-shape relationship reported in Lu and Beamish (2004). Using a longitudinal and comprehensive database on the population of U.S. MNCs from 1989 to 2007, we find no evidence of an S-shaped relationship; nor do we see a moderating effect of intangible assets. Although our results do show a marginally significant U-shaped association between multinationality and performance for a subsample of manufacturing firms, this relationship disappears once we account for the endogeneity of multinationality. Our study contributes to empirical research on the multinationality-performance relationship, highlighting the need for caution in generalizing results across countries and the importance of controlling for the endogeneity of multinationality when assessing its effect on performance. Managerial summary: Our study examines the relationship between a firm's multinationality and its performance. In a much-cited study, Lu and Beamish (2004) found evidence of an S-shaped relationship-with firm performance first decreasing, then increasing, then decreasing again as firms internationalized-in a sample of Japanese firms from 1986 to 1997. We test for the same relationship across all U.S. MNCs from 1989 to 2007, and find no evidence of an S-shaped pattern, or indeed, of any effect of multinationality at an aggregate level. Our study thus suggests that the effect of multinationality may vary with firm capabilities and home country environments, and that managers and academics alike should focus on understanding these specifics, rather than searching for a universal effect of multinationality on performance.

"Multi-leader teams are characterized by multiple leaders exhibiting mutual influence on each other while working towards a common team goal. An unexplored assumption in this literature is that increasing the number of leaders is related to heightened team effectiveness. The authors propose that this notion is oversimplified and suggest a contingency model of multi-leader team effectiveness. The authors suggest that the context determines the effectiveness of a particular multi-leader team configuration, because each formation has unique internal team mechanisms. To investigate this perspective, we review the multi-leader team literature (175 articles) by categorizing the extant theory and research as falling within nine multi-leader configurations along two key dimensions: (1) the proportion of leaders within a team; and (2) the dispersion of leadership through role co-enactment of team leaders. This framework enables a more coherent understanding as to the benefits and the costs of each specific multi-leader team configuration and a clearer evaluation of the contexts in which varying configurations are most effective. Four emerging themes related to configuration-contextualization are explained and theoretical implications for interpreting leadership effectiveness in multi-leader team settings are discussed.","['nanSHARED LEADERSHIP', 'DISTRIBUTED LEADERSHIP', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'CO-LEADERSHIP', 'COLLECTIVISTIC LEADERSHIP', 'CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'SELF-LEADERSHIP', 'MODEL', 'PERFORMANCE']",['model'],team effectiveness
"Since the 1990s, a growing body of research has sought to quantify the relationship between women's representation in leadership positions and organizational financial performance. Commonly known as the business case for women's leadership, the idea is that having more women leaders is good for business. Through meta-analysis (k = 78, n = 117,639 organizations) of the direct effects of women's representation in leadership (as CEOs, on top management teams, and on boards of directors) on financial performance, and tests that proxy theoretical arguments for moderated relationships, we call attention to equivocal findings. Our results suggest women's leadership may affect firm performance in general and sales performance in particular. And women's leadership-overall and, specifically, the presence of a female CEOis more likely to positively relate to firms' financial performance in more gender egalitarian cultures. Yet taking our findings as a whole, we argue that commonly used methods of testing the business case for women leaders may limit our ability as scholars to understand the value that women bring to leadership positions. We do not advocate that the business case be abandoned altogether but, rather, improved and refined. We name exemplary research studies to show how different perspectives on gender, alternative conceptualizations of value, and the specification of underlying mechanisms linking leadership to performance can generate changes in both the dominant ontology and the epistemology underlying this body of research.","['leadership', 'gender', 'meta-analysisCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE EVIDENCE', 'SEX-ROLE STEREOTYPES', 'GENDER DIVERSITY', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'BOARD COMPOSITION', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'DIRECTORS']","['leadership', 'gender', 'financial performance', 'financial performance', 'management', 'directors']",financial performance meta analysis cultures
"This study examines service recovery from an internal, operations-oriented perspective. Specifically, a model grounded in sociotechnical systems (STS) theory is developed and tested to investigate the relationships between service recovery systems, recovery climates, employee abilities and actions, and recovery performance. A sample of 221 general service employees is used to empirically test the proposed model. Results support the STS perspective and suggest that an integrated recovery system is essential in establishing a recovery climate, which in turn enables employee efficacy and reduces avoidance behaviors. Additionally, employee efficacy has a positive effect on performance, while avoidance leads to ineffective failure correction. The results presented herein highlight the need for service practitioners to consider designing and implementing integrated recovery systems in order to enhance the abilities of employees, while heightening the likelihood of failure correction. Furthermore, this study provides an initial step in moving the recovery literature into a more theory-driven direction.","['service recovery', 'operations management', 'sociotechnical systems theory (STS)', 'empirical research', 'structural equation modelingCUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'JOB', 'ORIENTATION', 'ENCOUNTERS', 'DESIGN', 'IMPACT', 'MODEL', 'WORK']","['service recovery', 'service recovery', 'design', 'model']",service recovery model sociotechnical systems employee efficacy
"This research examines the relationship between narcissistic personality characteristics in Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and firms' innovation outcomes. The authors argue that firms led by narcissistic CEOs are likely to exhibit a higher rate of new product introductions and a greater proportion of radical innovations in their new product portfolios, but they are also more likely to encounter product-harm crises. The impact of CEO narcissism on these innovation outcomes is partially mediated by firms' higher competitive aggressiveness. High power of the marketing department in the top management team, however, increases firms' customer orientation, which in turn weakens the relationship between CEO narcissism and product-harm crises. A longitudinal analysis of a sample of 395 publicly listed U.S. firms in the period 2006-2010 provides considerable support for the authors' hypotheses. This research underscores the importance of studying CEOs' personality traits as antecedents of firms' innovation outcomes, highlights the positive and negative impact of CEO narcissism on firms' innovation-related behavior, and delineates the process through which this impact takes place.","['CEO narcissism', 'Competitive aggressiveness', 'Customer orientation', 'Innovation', 'Product-harmcrises', 'Marketing department powerCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'MARKET', 'POWER', 'IMPACT']","['ceo narcissism', 'ceo narcissism', 'competitive aggressiveness', 'competitive aggressiveness', 'customer orientation', 'customer orientation', 'innovation', 'top management', 'top management', 'market', 'power', 'impact']",radical innovations ceo narcissism management
"Much prior work illuminates how fans of a brand can contribute to the value enjoyed by other members of its audience, but little is known about any processes by which fans contribute to the dissipation of that audience. Using longitudinal data on America's Next Top Model, a serial brand, and conceptualizing brands as assemblages of heterogeneous components, this article examines how fans can contribute to the destabilization of a brand's identity and fuel the dissipation of audiences of which they have been members. This work suggests that explanations focusing on satiation, psychology, or semiotics are inadequate to account for dissipation in the audience for serial brands. Moreover, the perspective advanced here highlights how fans can create doppelganger brand images and contribute to the co-destruction of serial brands they have avidly followed.","['nanCONSUMERS', 'EXTENSIONS', 'MEANINGS', 'IDENTITY', 'IMPACT', 'MYTHS']",['identity'],america top model brand doppelganger brand images
"Many firms rely on external organizations to acquire knowledge that is useful for developing creative new products and reducing the time needed to bring these products to market. Cluster theory suggests that this knowledge is often obtained from organizations located in close geographic proximity. Specifically, proximity is assumed to foster heightened face-to-face communication, strengthened relational ties, increased knowledge acquisition, and enhanced new product outcomes. The authors identify the limitations of these assumptions and offer an enriched model of the influence of geographic proximity on new product development, which they test using both a cross-sectional survey of 155 firms in the U.S. optics industry and a longitudinal follow-up survey of 73 of these firms. They find that firms located in close proximity engage in increased face-to-face communication, but this communication has little effect on the acquisition of the types of knowledge that lead to enhanced new product outcomes. In contrast, they find that e-mail communication leads to both enhanced new product creativity and development speed. In addition, they find that relational ties moderate rather than mediate the path connecting geographic proximity and new product outcomes. These findings imply that the new product development outcomes typically ascribed to close geographic proximity may actually be attributed to strong relational ties.","['nanABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'MEDIA RICHNESS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'INFORMATION', 'COOPERATION', 'CLUSTERS', 'FIRM', 'TIES', 'COMMUNICATION', 'IMPROVISATION']","['knowledge', 'firm', 'ties', 'communication']",cluster theory communication ties knowledge

"Although foreign multinational firms from the Triad regions increasingly use mainland China as both a sourcing and a marketing location, no study has directly examined the sourcing strategy - performance linkage. Using resource complementarity and resource dependence theory, we extend the sourcing literature and apply these perspectives to an important transitional economy China. These two theoretical perspectives suggest that product and uncertainty factors moderate the relationship between strategic alliance-based sourcing ( SA sourcing) of major components and market performance. We find that, at low levels of product innovativeness and technological uncertainty, the use of SA sourcing is positively related to market performance. However, the effects of product differentiation and demand uncertainty on the sourcing - performance relationship are insignificant.","['strategic alliance', 'sourcing', 'foreign firms', 'ChinaRESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS', 'INTERFIRM COOPERATION', 'CHANNEL INTEGRATION', 'TRANSITION ECONOMY', 'NETWORKS', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'INNOVATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'JAPANESE']","['strategic alliance', 'strategic alliance', 'sourcing', 'uncertainty']",performance complementarity
"Explanations for field change emphasize the role of purposeful strategic actors, paying little attention to uncoordinated but cohesive social groups, despite their profound impacts on fields ranging from autos and news to politics. Using a mixed methods approach, we study Millennials' driving behaviours, focusing on the role of generation cohorts as field actors. Combining in-depth qualitative analysis with an original nationwide survey (N = 2,225) we find that Millennials exhibit significantly different driving behaviour than earlier generations, driving for roughly 8 per cent fewer trips. These differences are primarily due to their attitudes, not, as commonly presumed, socio-economic factors. Our results contribute to theory on fields and collective actors. First, we identify a new field phenomenon,correlated groups, uncoordinated actors behaving as collective agents due to shared experiences and characteristics. Second, we identify four mechanisms through which correlated groups impact fields:correlated imprinting, cohorts as conduit, cohort myth apathy,andcohort myth creation.","['automotive field', 'correlated groups', 'field actors', 'generation cohort', 'institutional field', 'Millennials', 'technological changeINSTITUTIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS', 'PERSONAL NORMS', 'CAR USE', 'DYNAMICS', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'PRODUCT', 'MARKETS', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'CONFIGURATION']","['correlated groups', 'correlated groups', 'field actors', 'field actors', 'generation cohort', 'generation cohort', 'millennials']",social impacts millennials generation cohorts imprinting
"In contrast to the abundance of evidence on employee reactions to manager unfairness, we know very little about factors that predict whether managers will act fairly or not. This article explores the effect of procedural unfairness that emanates from higher level managers on procedural fairness enactment at lower levels in the organization. We argue that lower level managers can enact both more and less fair procedures in response to higher level unfairness and that this depends on the extent to which lower level managers define the self in terms of their relation with their higher level manager (i.e., relational-interdependent self-construal). We study both the moderating role of self-construal and how it is embedded in the physical environment of the organization. We pay particular attention to how spatial distance between higher and lower management affects self-construal at lower levels and-because of this relationship-the enactment of fair procedures within the organization. We conduct four studies (in two of which we study spatial distance as an antecedent for self-construal) and show that relatively high levels of relational-interdependent self-construal lead to assimilation in terms of procedural fairness enactment, whereas relatively low levels lead to contrast.","['procedural fairness enactment', 'relational-interdependent self-construal', 'spatial distance', 'assimilation vs. contrast', 'higher level management influencesTRICKLE-DOWN MODEL', 'ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE', 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE', 'ABUSIVE SUPERVISION', 'SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION', 'ETHICAL LEADERSHIP', 'FOCUSED MODEL', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'MANAGEMENT']","['procedural fairness enactment', 'procedural fairness enactment', 'procedural fairness enactment', 'relational interdependent self construal', 'relational interdependent self construal', 'relational interdependent self construal', 'relational interdependent self construal', 'spatial distance', 'spatial distance', 'management']",self construal spatial distance
"This paper develops a real options portfolio perspective on foreign affiliate divestments. Affiliates are less likely to be divested in response to adverse environmental change if they represent growth or switch option value to the multinational firm under conditions of macroeconomic uncertainty. However, the affiliate is partially redundant to the option value of the multinational firm's affiliate portfolio if the affiliate shares the manufacturing platform role in the host country with other affiliates, or if macroeconomic conditions of the host country are highly correlated with those of other countries in which the multinational firm operates affiliates. We find strong support for these arguments in tests on a comprehensive sample of 1078 Asian manufacturing affiliates of Japanese electronics multinationals.","['divestment', 'portfolio theory', 'multinational corporations (MNCs) and enterprises (MNEs)', 'real optionsRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'JAPANESE ELECTRONICS FIRMS', 'DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'EXCHANGE-RATES', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'PLATFORM INVESTMENTS', 'UNITED-STATES', 'SURVIVAL', 'ENTRY']",['divestment'],options affiliate divestments
"The quest for a better understanding of how consumers' quality perceptions and satisfaction judgement contribute to ultimate purchase intentions continues to represent one of the key challenges facing service marketers.

This study demonstrates that unobserved potential higher-order factors (and their interactions) in such efforts can lead to problems associated with interpreting regression coefficients as importance weights. A framework is proposed, and empirically validated in a multiindustry study, to assist service marketers in identifying potential higher-order factors and their interactions in their own models of consumer decision-making in service settings. The managerial and research implications of the study are presented and discussed.","['nanMEASURING SERVICE QUALITY', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'CONSUMPTION EMOTION', 'COMPARISON STANDARD', 'MODEL', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'MODERATOR', 'REASSESSMENT', 'STRATEGIES', 'VARIABLES']","['model', 'variables']",perceptions
"This study examines the characteristics that make start-up biotechnology firms attractive alliance partners. We distinguish between firm specific and location-specific characteristics as well as between foreign and domestic corporate partners. We present and test a longitudinal model of alliance development based on data from 64 public biotechnology firms. The results provide evidence that foreign and domestic alliance capital inflows are driven by different factors. Firm-specific factors explain minimal variance in capital inflows from foreign alliance partners; rather, location-specific factors seem to matter more. The reverse is true for domestic alliance partners. Further, our results suggest that firm size moderates the relationship between location-specific factors and capital inflows from foreign alliance partners such that larger firms benefit more when located in technologically munificent environments.

"By investigating gendered shopping styles across countries, the authors explore whether the differences between male and female shopping styles are greater than the differences in shopping styles exhibited by consumers across countries. With a conceptual model, this study tests an extant convergence hypothesis that predicts that men and women should grow more similar in their shopping styles as traditional gender-based divisions in wage and domestic labor disappear. The results of a survey of shopping behavior across I I countries indicate though that men and women are evolutionarily predisposed to different shopping styles. These differences in shopping styles also are greater in countries with higher levels of gender equality. Empathizing, or the ability to tune in to others' thoughts and feelings, mediates shopping styles more for women; systemizing, or the degree to which a person possesses spatial skills, mediates shopping styles more for men. These results suggest that gender-based retail segmentation is more strategically relevant than country-based segmentation. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for international marketing theory and practice.","['shopping styles', 'gender', 'evolutionary psychology', 'international market segmentationINTERNATIONAL MARKET-SEGMENTATION', 'DECISION-MAKING STYLES', 'GAP-PREDICTS-DEGREE', 'SEX-DIFFERENTIATION', 'CONSUMERS', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'PSYCHOLOGY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'CULTURE', 'ACCULTURATION']","['shopping styles', 'shopping styles', 'gender', 'consumers', 'behavior']",shopping styles model women
"Using clickstream panel data from an automobile ad campaign conducted on a mobile platform, we investigate the relevance of mobile advertising, the interrelationships between ad content, information search behavior, and advertising response. Temporally, we compare mobile users' search behavior and advertising response before and during a focal campaign event of an automobile show. Spatially, we examine their search behavior and advertising response in relation to their proximity to the show's location. Estimation results from individual-user random effects binary Logit and Poisson count models show that users' responses to mobile advertising are related to the depth and breadth of search and the ad content. While informative and persuasive ad content exhibits differential non-linear effects on the depth and breadth of search, they have similar effects on advertising response. Interestingly, spatial and temporal proximity of mobile ad campaigns may not lead to increased relevance of mobile campaigns; it depends on the type of ad content and the type of measure used to assess relevance.

"With crowdfunding, an entrepreneur raises external financing from a large audience (the crowd), in which each individual provides a very small amount, instead of soliciting a small group of sophisticated investors. This article compares two forms of crowdfunding: entrepreneurs solicit individuals either to pre-order the product or to advance a fixed amount of money in exchange for a share of future profits (or equity). In either case, we assume that crowdfunders enjoy community benefits that increase their utility. Using a unified model, we show that the entrepreneur prefers pre-ordering if the initial capital requirement is relatively small compared with market size and prefers profit sharing otherwise. Our conclusions have implications for managerial decisions in the early development stage of firms, when the entrepreneur needs to build a community of individuals with whom he or she must interact. We also offer extensions on the impact of quality uncertainty and information asymmetry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"The last decade has fundamentally changed the face of retailing! The genesis has been increased customer fragmentation, enabling technologies such as the internet and increased competition In this era of hypercompetition, retailers need to have a better understanding of the performance of individual stores so they can more accurately plan their merchandise assortments and set more realistic merchandising goals. In this paper, we determine the performance of retail outlets relative to the best practice set of outlets and demonstrate the importance of accommodating both regional and assortment differences. We empirically assess the performance of stores from a major Fortune 500 multinational retailing chain. Multiple inputs and outputs from 59 stores in three regions were used to determine sales goals for two different product categories. The results of three alternative models suggest that incorporating both assortment and regional differences significantly affects both performance and predicted sales volume estimates. Implications and avenues for future research are discussed.","['nanDATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS', 'EFFICIENCY', 'PERFORMANCE']",['performance'],hypercompetition
"Choice is introduced into attitudinal models, which traditionally have focused on nonchoice contexts. Four alternative models integrating the information-processing and attitudinal literatures are developed to represent different possible mental comparison processes leading to choice. It is proposed that consumers may compare beliefs about alternatives, or they may compare expectancy-value components, attitudes, or intentions, in order to choose between alternatives. The conditions under which each of these choice models is likely to be employed are discussed. For example, when facing few alternatives where one or more alternatives are somewhat unfamiliar and where beliefs about alternatives can be naturally g into a small number of salient dimensions, consumers are most likely to compare expectancy-value components across alternatives in order to make a choice. In a preliminary test of the proposed framework, the four alternative choice models are tested for a context that fits these specific conditions. A comparative analysis indicates that the Expectancy Comparison Model, which is conceptually appropriate for these conditions, also has the best fit with the data.","['nanINFORMATION INTEGRATION PERSPECTIVE', 'REASONED ACTION', 'CONSUMER CHOICE', 'NONCOMPARABLE ALTERNATIVES', 'BEHAVIORAL-INTENTIONS', 'FISHBEIN', 'PRODUCT', 'COMMON', 'FIT']",['fit'],contexts choice
"There is wide consensus that the brand experience literature (BEL) suffers from a deficit in conceptual works. This study argues that, for brand experience research to overcome its conceptual insipidity, it must re-examine the core of its intellectual structure to rediscover what 'an experience provided by brands' truly implies. The purpose of this paper is to reconceptualize and present a future research framework for research into the concept of brand experience, by identifying both the core and peripheral sources of knowledge of the concept and its association with brand meaning. Through a bibliometric process covering 136 articles published between 2002 and 2018, resulting in a database of 2698 citations, this brand experience conceptual paper fills a critical research gap by providing the first full-scale bibliometric study to date of the BEL, using a combination of high citation and co-citation metrics. Based on this conceptual reorientation, a matrix for future development is presented, enabling the reader to visualize the scope and breadth of potential brand experience research horizons in areas relating to customer experience, consumer-brand relationship, online brand experience and sensory brand experience. The four approaches listed in the matrix - firm-based, social constructionist, virtuality and embodiment - provide a roadmap for future brand experience research undertakings to explore the rich potential of experience evoked by brands.","['nanVALUE CO-CREATION', 'CONSUMPTION EXPERIENCE', 'CONSUMER CULTURE', 'EQUITY', 'PRICE', 'ROLES', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'ENGAGEMENT', 'FRAMEWORK', 'IMPACT']",['framework'],brand experience framework meaning consumer online brand experience
"Working from the perspective of the resource-based view of strategy, this paper addresses whether academics, consultants, and other sources of general managerial prescriptions can affect firms' long-run rent streams. The answer is affirmative. To demonstrate this, I discuss the use of motivational techniques as a well-understood and common managerial choice that may affect a firm's chance of generating rents. This paper interprets extant Empirical research on goal setting and discusses the conceptualization of temporal rent patterns. I build upon an empirical finding in goal-setting research to compare the temporal patterns of rents for managerial choices embedded in path-dependent vs. path-independent processes.

"The widespread availability of online word of mouth (WOM) enables modern consumers to assess not only the opinions of others about products and services, but also the extent to which those opinions are consistent or dispersive. Despite long-standing calls for greater understanding of mixed opinions, existing evidence is inconclusive regarding effects of WOM dispersion, and theoretical accounts have relied primarily on the notion of reference dependence. Extending prior work, this research proposes an attribution-based account, in which consumer interpretation of WOM dispersion depends on the extent to which tastes in a product domain are perceived to be dissimilar, so that dispersion can be attributed to inconsistency in reviewer preferences rather than the product itself. Across four experimental studies, participants presented with online rating distributions were more tolerant of dispersion in taste-dissimilar product domains than taste-similar product domains, and the difference was driven by underlying attributions. Together, these findings expand current understanding of WOM, social distributions, and risk perception, by revealing distinct pathways through which consumers respond to differences of opinion. In addition, they suggest the opportunity to proactively influence the manner in which dispersion is perceived, highlighting its positive connotations while diminishing its association with risk.","['nanCONSUMER REVIEWS', 'PRODUCT', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'IMPACT', 'OTHERS', 'SALES', 'DYNAMICS', 'RATINGS', 'CONVERSATIONS', 'DISTRIBUTIONS']","['product', 'others', 'distributions']",word of mouth dependence attributions risk perception
"This paper analyzes the theory of entrepreneurial incentives in the work of Israel Kirzner. It argues that there is a logical problem with the notion of profit opportunities as exogenous causal agents: Without additional assumptions, the existence of opportunities alone does not sufficiently explain the alertness of entrepreneurs. The paper considers both stronger and weaker versions of this problem. It also questions the relation between entrepreneurial incentives and the tendency toward entrepreneurial success. Finally, it provides some commentary on the relevance of entrepreneurial incentives for an overall theory of the entrepreneur, and identifies several potential solutions to the problems discussed.","['nanDISCOVERY', 'CREATION', 'SEARCH', 'OPPORTUNITIES', 'KNOWLEDGE']",['opportunities'],
"The globalization of American business has reactivated a long-standing debate over international exportability of American management theory and practice. This controversy prompted an investigation into factors binding foreign employees to an American multinational enterprise and the consistency of those effects across the firm's culturally diverse subsidiaries. In a survey, 1,859 managers from 15 European and Canadian affiliates of a U.S. multinational firm described their organizational commitment and bases for that commitment-namely, job scope, role clarity, extrinsic rewards, and participative management. Applying structural equations modeling, we determined whether or not commitment sources similarly developed company attachment across offshore operations. The findings disclosed that these antecedents strongly predicted commitment but displayed no meaningful cultural moderation.

"A series of experiments illustrates a learning process that enhances brand equity at the expense of quality-determining attributes. When the relationship between brand name and product quality is learned prior to the relationship between product attributes and quality, inhibition of the latter may occur.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focuss on customer driven supply chains and what this means for the management of freight transport, a key process in the supply chain as it acts as a physical link between customers and suppliers. It aims to assess whether some of the new collaborative models for transport management are delivering better optimised solutions. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a multi-dimensional methodological approach, which includes empirical, model building, opinion and archival evidence. Much of the thinking and findings in this paper have been derived from a series of quasi-delphi discussion sessions with logistics industry experts from three sectors, steel, grocery and construction and experienced academics in the fields of logistics and supply chain management. Findings - The paper sets out to argue that new innovative solutions are emerging for better transport optimisation, that exploit the competitive power of collaboration, both vertically with supply chain partners and horizontally with other logistics service providers (LSPs). Research limitations/implications - The research was largely focused on the road freight transport industry in the UK and Europe. However, it is felt that similar thinking can be deployed in other settings for alternative transport modes and other geographical regions. From an academic perspective the paper contributes to the notion that supply chain management as well as focussing on vertical coordination and process integration also needs to incorporate the potential considerable power of horizontal collaboration. Originality/value - In particular it is original in that it highlights how important it is to combine vertical collaboration with horizontal collaboration if better optimised transport solutions are to be achieved. This is of considerable value and interest both to practitioner and academic communities.","['transport management', 'horizontal integration', 'supply chain managementSUPPLY CHAIN', 'INVENTORY']","['transport management', 'transport management']",transport models collaboration uk integration
"Value creation through customer-to-customer exchange occurs when the perceived benefits of a company's offering are increased as a result of customers' interaction with one another. C2C exchange exists in a wide variety of service environments, both online and face-to-face. Drawing on the motivation, opportunity, and ability (MOA) framework, this research presents and tests a theoretical model that examines antecedents and outcomes of C2C exchange in the context of face-to-face networking behaviors at professional association meetings. Data were obtained from a survey of conference attendees, and the hypotheses were tested using moderated regression and path analysis. The results show a three-way interaction effect among the MOA factors, that the MOA model does predict the level of C2C exchange, and that C2C exchange does enhance service value perceptions and customer loyalty intentions.","['customer-to-customer', 'C2C', 'exchange', 'value', 'services marketing', 'associations', 'members', 'MOA', 'motivation', 'opportunity', 'ability', 'loyalty', 'know-how', 'interaction effectINFORMATION', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'COMMITMENT']","['customer to customer', 'customer to customer', 'customer to customer', 'c2c', 'exchange', 'value', 'moa', 'motivation', 'opportunity', 'ability', 'loyalty']",customer to customer exchange motivation opportunity framework behaviors
"How rigorous have our data-collection procedures been in international business research? We report the results of a comprehensive content analysis of scholarly work published in four leading international business journals over the past decade. The focus is data-collection procedures used by researchers in mail surveys. The intent is to be self-critical and formulate strategies for enhancing the rigor and success of data-collection procedures in survey-based research. Our findings confirm that international business scholars could significantly improve surveys' response rates by following more rigorous and well-established methodological practices already established in the social science literature. We also find that, while some continents tend to be oversampled, a large portion of the world remains underrepresented in international business research. The results point to interesting trends in cross-cultural data-collection procedures. Given that primary research will always drive new knowledge creation, scholars are strongly advised to practice best-available procedures for data collection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"This paper reports the findings of a 12-nation study designed to test empirically the relationships between societal cultural values, individual social beliefs, and the perceived effectiveness of different influence strategies. The relationships between three types of broad influence strategy (persuasive, assertive, and relationship based) and four dimensions of individual beliefs (cynicism, fate control, reward for application, and religiosity) were examined. Three of Project GLOBE's cultural values (in-group collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and future orientation) were selected to investigate their direct effects on the rated effectiveness of influence strategies, and their possible interaction with dimensions of individual beliefs. Results showed that different dimensions of individual social beliefs predict the perceived effectiveness of the three types of influence strategy, and that cultural values can moderate the strength of the relationship between these dimensions of individual social beliefs and the perceived effectiveness of influence strategies.","['social beliefs', 'cultural values', 'influence strategiesINFLUENCE TACTICS', 'UNITED-STATES', 'WORK VALUES', 'LEADERSHIP', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'ATTITUDES']","['social beliefs', 'social beliefs', 'cultural values', 'cultural values']",values influence strategies religiosity

"Researchers have explored in depth how social movement actors strive to pass laws to change organizations exogenously or to demand that they make commitments or policy changes. But ensuring that organizations implement such commitments or policies is challenging. Insider activists may be influential for implementation processes, and I explore how they can increase that influence. I contend that insider activists influence such processes by offering their organizations implementation resources, such as free and ready-to-use content and model programs that reflect changes the activists want to see. To develop this argument, I explore how, starting in the mid-2000s, LGBT activists developed resources to ensure that diversity policies were increasingly relevant for sexual minorities in France. Many diversity policies at the time expressed commitment to gender, disability, age . . . Activists contended that nothing was done for the minorities who were not named-those left in the ellipsis (. . .) of diversity. Using web archives and interviews, I show that LGBT rights activists increased their influence on French organizations by developing implementation resources that corporations could readily use to flesh out their diversity commitments and implement diversity programs to promote the inclusion of LGBT employees. I demonstrate how insider activists used these implementation resources to denounce organizations' superficial commitments or employees' homophobic practices, thereby compelling organizations to change.","['diversity', 'organization theory', 'social movements', 'implementationCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'PRIVATE POLITICS', 'CEO IDEOLOGY', 'IDENTITY', 'MOVEMENT', 'MODEL', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DISCLOSURE', 'TARGETS', 'ISSUES']","['diversity', 'movement', 'model']",

"Research is lacking on the role of international entrepreneurship when the focus is on management's efforts in external organization and firm level dissemination of knowledge from partners after a foreign market entry. The theoretical framework fills this gap and analyses the relationship between entrepreneurial competence and two relational capabilities of partnership knowledge exchange and partnership management. It further investigates their influence on firms' performance at the initial and subsequent export expansion stages using a sample of 100 firms from ICT industry. The results indicate a positive relationship between entrepreneurial competence and the relational capabilities. However, relational capability of partnership knowledge exchange is only found to influence the initial export expansion stage. The overall theoretical model provides more support for the effects of entrepreneurial competence at the subsequent export expansion stage. For managerial purposes, the results demonstrate that different capabilities are needed at different stages of export expansion and that capabilities do not always provide competitive advantage.

"Research summary: We provide evidence that founder chief executive officers (CEOs) of large S&P 1500 companies are more overconfident than their nonfounder counterparts (professional CEOs). We measure overconfidence via tone of CEO tweets, tone of CEO statements during earnings conference calls, management earnings forecasts, and CEO option-exercise behavior. Compared with professional CEOs, founder CEOs use more optimistic language on Twitter and during earnings conference calls. In addition, founder CEOs are more likely to issue earnings forecasts that are too high; they are also more likely to perceive their firms to be undervalued, as implied by their option-exercise behavior. We provide evidence that, to date, investors appear unaware of this overconfidence bias among founders. Managerial summary: This article helps to explain why firms managed by founder chief executive officers (CEOs) behave differently from those managed by professional CEOs. We study a sample of S&P 1500 firms and find strong evidence that founder CEOs are more overconfident than professional CEOs. To date, investors appear unaware of this overconfidence bias among founders.

"The management literature suggests that setting strategic goals facilitates the identification of appropriate business strategies and focuses management attention and available resources on their accomplishment, enabling subsequent goal realization. Yet the literature also indicates that firms often find it difficult to realize their strategic goals and may find it even more challenging to do so when operating in foreign markets. However, little is known empirically about the extent to which strategic goals enable desired strategic positions to be achieved and factors that may affect this relationship. We examine this important issue using primary data from a sample of exporting manufacturers. Results support the existence of previously theorized strategic goal-realized strategic position gaps and show that these negatively impact performance. Thus, simply setting strategic goals does not necessarily aid in accomplishing the desired outcomes, and any failure to do so is costly. Drawing on organization theory, we find that internal capabilities and knowledge, and external market factors play important roles in minimizing such strategic goal-realized strategic position gaps. Specifically, we show that businesses with stronger architectural capabilities, those with higher levels of internationalization, and those operating in less dynamic market environments are better able to realize their intended strategic objectives and thereby enjoy superior performance.","['Strategic goals', 'Architectural capabilities', 'Internationalization', 'PerformanceINTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES', 'SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'MANAGEMENT CONTROL-SYSTEMS', 'MARKET-ORIENTED BEHAVIOR', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'FIRM CAPABILITIES', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-EFFECTIVENESS', 'TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES']","['strategic goals', 'strategic goals', 'architectural capabilities', 'architectural capabilities', 'internationalization']",capabilities
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the understanding and behaviour of construction companies in relation to supply chain management (SCM) and how those relationships can impact the adoption of the SCM concept. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopted a descriptive study method based on a cross-section survey. A literature review and focus group interviews were used to design the survey questionnaire. The focus group interviews were also used to discuss the results of the survey and draw conclusions. Findings - The results show that the global awareness level of SCM and the relationships level among the entities in the Portuguese construction industry are low, which is in alignment with previous research work. These results also show that SCM in the construction industry is a complex task due to the fact that the relationships between the entities are different, and also often contractors and subcontractors change roles from project-to-project. Research limitations/implications - The limited number of valid responses in the research, particularly when considering categories based on the size of the contractors, can be considered a major limitation of this research, which might have reduced the quality of the statistic tests performed. Practical implications - Construction companies should foster a proper understanding of the language and core concepts underpinning SCM practices and should pay particular attention to a systemic and network perspective, avoiding the traditional focus on the management of dyadic relationships. Accordingly, care must be taken to avoid the simple and direct transfer of the SCM concept to the construction sector. Originality/value - This paper provides contributions to understanding the awareness of SCM within the construction industry and to the field of SCM, confirming that it is the specifics, and not the context, of the construction sector that are not well-adapted to the assumptions underpinning SCM and related concepts.","['Construction industry', 'Survey', 'Empirical study', 'Supply chain managementSUCCESS FACTORS', 'PROJECTS', 'THINKING']","['construction industry', 'construction industry', 'survey']",supply chain management portuguese construction industry

"Social commerce platforms have gained prominence in e-commerce, as social media has become an integral part of users' online activities. Therefore, firms have been either developing or utilizing social commerce platforms to increase user engagement by adding social shopping facility onto their electronic commerce platforms. However, managing user engagement and user interaction becomes complex when e-commerce platforms are transformed into social commerce platforms. In this study, we operationalize four distinct stages of the social commerce platform, namely, social identification, social interaction, social shopping, and transaction based on salience theory. Using clickstream data, we empirically measure user engagement in these four states by modeling users' incidence and time spent. Drawing from the PageRank algorithm, we capture the importance of ranking and distance on user engagement. The model also accounts for the effects of situational variables such as weekend; holiday; time of day; and user characteristics, such as gender and social media setting. Our results suggest that ranking and distance have significant effects on users' incidence as well as time spent on social commerce platforms.

"Extending extant literature on geographic scope that has primarily focused on its role in value creation, I investigate the value appropriation aspect of geographic scope of knowledge acquisition. I maintain that isolating mechanisms created via geographic scope of knowledge acquisition can help firms prevent competitors from accessing their innovative knowledge and, by doing so, can help firms capture a larger proportion of economic returns from innovation, thus helping them enjoy better financial performance.

"Complementing and extending prior studies on the value of existing work relationships, this study examines whether we can predict the value of brand-new ties before people ever meet. We examine this question by developing three sets of hypotheses reflecting the three main perspectives in the social networks literature: the resource (actor), dyadic (tie), and structural (network) perspective. To test our hypotheses, we asked executives to reach out for advice from someone they had never met and to complete a survey of their various thoughts about the other person both before and after making a connection. We find support for all three perspectives after a connection has been made; however, before tie formation, we find evidence only for the structural perspective. Our results suggest that the lack of reliable information about strangers obscures which brand-new ties will turn out to be more valuable but that surrounding network structures remain a reliable predictor of value, even for brand-new ties.","['social networks', 'social capital', 'new ties', 'tie formation', 'strangers', 'knowledge transfer', 'advice seekingSAMPLE SELECTION BIAS', 'SOCIAL NETWORKS', 'WEAK TIES', 'PERCEIVED TRUSTWORTHINESS', 'OCCUPATIONAL-STATUS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'TRUST', 'HELP', 'RESOURCES', 'STRENGTH']","['social networks', 'social networks', 'new ties', 'new ties', 'tie formation', 'tie formation', 'strangers', 'social networks', 'social networks']",networks
"Academics as well as managers have long been interested in the role of satisfaction with complaint handling (SATCOM) in shaping customers' attitudes and repurchasing decisions. This interest has generated a widespread belief that SATCOM is driven by the perception that the complaint handling process is just. To test how SATCOM is modulated by distributive, interactional, or procedural justice, we performed a meta-analysis of 60 independent studies of the antecedents and consequences of SATCOM. Results indicate that SATCOM is affected most by distributive justice, then by interactional justice, and only weakly by procedural justice. We also find that SATCOM mediates the effects of justice dimensions on word-of-mouth. However, contrary to common belief, SATCOM does not mediate the effects of justice dimensions on overall satisfaction and return intent. We draw on our results to suggest several avenues for further research.","['Satisfaction with complaint handling', 'Meta-analysis', 'Service recovery', 'Service failure', 'Justice theoryWORD-OF-MOUTH', 'ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'PERCEIVED JUSTICE', 'RECOVERY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'RESPONSES', 'FAILURE', 'LOYALTY']","['satisfaction with complaint handling', 'satisfaction with complaint handling', 'satisfaction with complaint handling', 'satisfaction with complaint handling', 'meta analysis', 'meta analysis']",satisfaction complaint handling procedural justice meta analysis
"This article examines the determinants of success in self-employment, with a focus on the effects of the time spent caring for children. Many public policies are designed to encourage self-employment, especially among women. In addition, it has been argued that one of the reasons individuals, and women in particular, choose self-employment over wage and salary sector employment is to spend more time with their children. The effect of time spent with children on the probability of continuing in self-employment has not been studied in previous work, however. This study analyzes spells of self-employment among workers in eight European nations. Using data from the European Community Household Panel survey for 1994-1999, we estimate the effect of time spent caring for children on the duration of self-employment, controlling for other factors that affect self-employment success rates. The estimates indicate that caring for children significantly reduces the duration of self-employment ventures, for both males and females, and in most countries studied. The results suggest that policy makers need to consider child care policies in conjunction with self-employment policies.","['nanTIME', 'WOMEN', 'MEN', 'ENTREPRENEURS', 'HOUSEWORK', 'SURVIVAL', 'DYNAMICS', 'CREATION', 'PARENTS', 'GENDER']","['women', 'men']",self employment caring
"Product development teams become increasingly dispersed because innovative project tasks require the input of specialized knowledge at multiple locations. Prior analyses indicate that as team member dispersion increases teams find it more difficult to perform high-quality teamwork. Moreover, the literature has largely assumed that the performance effect of teamwork in innovative projects would be driven by the nature of the project task and that this would be true regardless of the degree to which team members were co-located. The present study argues, however, that teamwork affects team performance more strongly as team member dispersion increases. Two main reasons for this are discussed: (1) High-quality teamwork can leverage the increased knowledge potential of dispersed teams; and (2) team leaders in more dispersed teams have little possibility to compensate low-quality teamwork through hands-on leadership. Responses from 575 managers, team leaders, and team members of 145 new product development (NPD) projects in the software industry were used to analyze the moderating effect of team member proximity on the relationship between teamwork quality and team performance. Using regression analysis, support is found for the initial hypothesis that team member dispersion moderates the relationship between teamwork quality and team performance, that is, that increasing team member dispersion increases the positive impact of teamwork quality on team performance. As such, the present analysis advances understanding of dispersed teams, showing that teamwork quality not only is more difficult to achieve but also is more critical to team performance as team dispersion increases. Furthermore, low-proximity teams can reach higher levels of effectiveness and efficiency than co-located ones if they manage to achieve high levels of teamwork over distance. Thus, team dispersion may well be an opportunity and should not just be regarded as a liability to be overcome or avoided. This research recognizes that the vast majority of teams are neither perfectly co-located nor perfectly virtual. There are many shades of gray between these two extremes, and various individual, team, task, and contextual characteristics may have an effect on how decreases-however small-in geographical proximity affect the process and performance of teams. Future research is encouraged to address such factors at different levels of analysis aimed at providing managers with recommendations for dispersed teamwork.","['nanCOMPUTER-MEDIATED INTERACTION', 'GLOBAL VIRTUAL TEAMS', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'INNOVATIVE PROJECTS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'COMMUNICATION', 'REQUIREMENTS', 'COORDINATION']","['product development', 'product development', 'innovative projects', 'innovative projects', 'performance', 'knowledge']",knowledge
"The growth and proliferation of global systems and transnational cultures have generated larger and more diverse types of cosmopolitans, all of whom span conventional social boundaries. Understanding this diversity is increasingly important because cosmopolitans often bridge across a wide range of transnational and global networks within and across global organizations. Drawing on multiple disciplines, we conceptualize cosmopolitanism as an embodied disposition characterized by high levels of cultural transcendence and openness that are manifested in and enacted along varied trajectories of cultural embeddedness in one's own culture and cultural engagement with the cultural Other. We then propose an analytical framework for the influence of cosmopolitan disposition on transcultural brokerage processes, specifically, on bridging structural and cultural holes. Finally, we present a typology of cosmopolitan brokers and their corresponding practices and activities as they engage in transcultural brokerage. By recognizing the diversity of cosmopolitans and their respective dispositions, we significantly expand the pool of global talent beyond the traditional focus on expatriates, and we challenge the conventional wisdom on who counts as talent in an interconnected world.","['cosmopolitanism', 'transcultural brokerage', 'global talent', 'structural holes', 'cultural holesKNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'SOCIAL-STRUCTURE', 'LOCATING COSMOPOLITANISM', 'INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS', 'TALENT MANAGEMENT', 'RELATIONAL VIEW', 'GLOBAL TALENT', 'NETWORKS', 'WORK', 'ORGANIZATIONS']","['cosmopolitanism', 'transcultural brokerage', 'transcultural brokerage', 'global talent', 'global talent', 'global talent', 'global talent', 'networks', 'work', 'organizations']",cosmopolitans diversity cultural
"This research introduces brand prominence, a construct reflecting the conspicuousness of a brand's mark or logo on a product. The authors propose a taxonomy that assigns consumers to one of four groups according to their wealth and need for status, and they demonstrate how each group's preference for conspicuously or inconspicuously branded luxury goods corresponds predictably with their desire to associate or dissociate with members of their own and other groups. Wealthy consumers low in need for status want to associate with their own kind and pay a premium for quiet goods only they can recognize. Wealthy consumers high in need for status use loud luxury goods to signal to the less affluent that they are not one of them. Those who are high in need for status but cannot afford true luxury use loud counterfeits to emulate those they recognize to be wealthy. Field experiments along with analysis of market data (including counterfeits) support the proposed model of status signaling using brand prominence.","['luxury', 'status', 'conspicuous consumption', 'brand prominence', 'branding', 'reference groups', 'associative/dissociative motives', 'counterfeit goodsSELF', 'POSSESSIONS', 'INCLUSION']","['luxury', 'status', 'brand prominence', 'brand prominence']",prominence luxury
"The topic of power has not featured strongly in debates about organizational learning, a point that is illustrated in a discussion of influential studies of teamworking. Despite the insights that such studies have provided into the nature of expertise and collaboration they have tended not to explore the relevance of issues of hierarchy, politics and institutionalized power relations. The paper addresses the problem by exploring the links between power, expertise and organizational learning Power is analysed both as the medium for, and the product of, collective activity. The approach emphasizes how skills and imaginations are intertwined with social, technical and institutional structures. While studies of teamworking have concentrated on situations where imaginations and structures are tightly linked, unexpected developments may occur when these relations are loosened. Such situations occur when the needs of the moment overshadow normal routines and relationships and there is no single overview or centre of control. It is suggested that organizational learning can be conceptualized as the movement between familiar and emergent activities and between established and emergent social relations. Events in a two-year action research project are used to illustrate the approach and explore episodes of decentred collaboration.","['nanKNOWLEDGE', 'WORK']",['work'],collaboration

"In several industries, new products are very similar in functional features but compete on their unique design. Firms like Alessi, Apple, Bang & Olufsen, Dyson, or Kartell all follow a design-driven innovation approach and use their products' visual appearance as the main mean for differentiation. In spite of this, design newness is never discussed among the dimensions of product innovativeness. Instead, conceptualizations of product innovativeness mostly focus on a product's technical newness or the changes it implies for the innovating firm or for the market it enters. This paper seeks to build an argument for why design newness should be considered as a dimension of product innovativeness. In addition to providing conceptual rationale, empirical evidence is offered on the influence of design newness on sales performance across a product's life cycle. To be able to put the findings into perspective, the performance effects of design newness are compared with those of technical newness. As several products exemplify that design newness and technical newness can go hand in hand, not only direct performance effects but also interaction effects between both newness dimensions are investigated. The arguments are tested on a sample of 157 new cars launched between 1978 and 2006 in Germany. The automobile industry is selected because of the strategic role of both technical and design aspects in product innovation. Putting a focus on this industry also has the advantage that historical information on car specifics and objective sales data over time are accessible. The results emphasize that both design and technical newness are important drivers of car sales. However, the effects differ widely across the product life cycle. While design newness has a positive impact right after the introduction and persists in strength over time, technical newness drives sales with a lagged effect and decreases toward the end of the life cycle. The test of a combined influence of design newness and technical newness on sales performance produces no significant results. These results open interesting avenues for future research on product innovativeness in general and design newness in particular. For management practice, the findings emphasize the importance of overall product innovativeness, clarify the different performance effects of design and technical newness across the product life cycle, and show the value of creating a unique visual product appearance to positively trigger product diffusion.","['nanINDUSTRIAL-DESIGN', 'PREDICTORS', 'IMPACT', 'FIRM', 'CATEGORIZATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'TECHNOLOGIES', 'JUDGMENTS', 'SELECTION', 'TYPOLOGY']","['impact', 'firm']",firms performance
"For providers of electronic services, quality is a major driving force on the route to long-term success. Comprehensive measurement of quality, in turn, is the key to effective quality management. Marketing academia has just started to attend to quality measurement in the context of electronic services. A review of existing literature on the subject reveals that important research gaps exist, both conceptually and methodologically. Building on extant research and findings from a qualitative study, the authors develop a broadly applicable, hierarchical quality model for electronic services, which includes three dimensions and nine subdimensions. The proposed model is rigorously tested by means of a large aggregated sample drawn from the customer bases of three different electronic services. The authors find support for the conceptualization and discuss important findings of the study as well as implications for managerial practice and research.","['electronic services', 'Internet', 'quality measurement', 'empirical studyCONSUMER PERCEPTIONS', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'SCALE DEVELOPMENT', 'SELF-SERVICE', 'PARADIGM', 'INTERNET']","['electronic services', 'electronic services', 'quality measurement', 'quality measurement']",services quality model

"Purpose - The paper shows how sustainable value chain analysis (SVCA) can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify misalignment between resource allocation and consumer preferences, using a case study of the Oxford Landing wine chain, from South Australia to the UK. Design/methodology/approach - The study incorporates a combination of value chain analysis (VCA) and life cycle analysis (LCA) in a single methodology to determine which activities, at each stage in the supply chain, create value (in the eyes of consumers) and the contribution of these activities to greenhouse gas emissions. Findings - The case study demonstrates the value of comparing the consumer value associated with a particular activity with the emissions associated with that activity, as this draws the attention of managers, at each stage of the supply chain, to the potential trade-offs that exist and the danger of focusing on either one (adding value or reducing emissions) in isolation. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of the research methodology is that the study focuses on a single product (Oxford Landing) and a single chain to a single country (UK). Thus, it is difficult to generalise from the results of this single case study to the (South Australian) wine industry in general, without further information from other wineries and consumer perceptions of their brands in different parts of the world. Practical implications - The case study highlights the importance of taking a holistic view when considering the sustainability of a product, process or chain trade-offs between environmental benefits and consumer perceptions of value can have significant commercial implications. It also illustrates the potential for SVCA to be used as a guide for the allocation of research and development expenditure (public and private) in pursuit of sustainable competitive advantage. Originality/value - The study is the first to combine LCA with VCA in a context that allows researchers, practitioners and policymakers to identify areas for improvement, in what they do and how they do it.","['Sustainability', 'Value chain analysis', 'Life cycle analysis', 'South Australian wine', 'Sustainable development', 'Environmental management', 'United KingdomCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'CUSTOMER VALUE', 'INTEGRATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE']","['sustainability', 'value chain analysis', 'value chain analysis', 'value chain analysis', 'life cycle analysis', 'life cycle analysis', 'life cycle analysis', 'south australian wine', 'south australian wine', 'south australian wine']",value chain analysis case study landing australia value chain analysis research sustainability
"The marketing channel literature has paid limited attention to institutional environments that constrain buyer-supplier exchanges, though such institutions are fundamental determinants of transaction costs, and thus of the occurrence of opportunism in the buyer-supplier dyads. Drawing on transaction cost economics and institutional theory, this study uncovers the critical influence of formal and informal institutions (i.e., legal effectiveness and networking expenditure) on the use of governance in deterring opportunism, as well as the moderating role of government support on the efficacy of governance mechanism. The findings from a buyer-supplier dyadic survey and 2secondary datasets reveal that legal effectiveness mitigates opportunism through increased use of both contractual and relational governance; in contrast, networking expenditure reduces opportunism through relational governance, yet increases opportunism via lowering contractual governance. In addition, contractual governance is more efficient in constraining opportunism when government support is high, whereas relational governance deters opportunism more when government support is low. These findings offer important implications for academic research and managerial practice.","['Institutional theory', 'Legal effectiveness', 'Networking expenditure', 'Government support', 'Opportunism', 'Buyer-supplier exchanges', 'Contractual governance', 'Relational governance', 'ChinaMARKETING CHANNELS', 'EMERGING MARKETS', 'SELLER RELATIONSHIPS', 'FOREIGN FIRMS', 'CHINA', 'PERFORMANCE', 'BUSINESS', 'TRUST', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'ENVIRONMENT']","['institutional theory', 'institutional theory', 'legal effectiveness', 'legal effectiveness', 'networking expenditure', 'networking expenditure', 'government support', 'government support', 'opportunism', 'buyer supplier exchanges', 'buyer supplier exchanges', 'buyer supplier exchanges', 'contractual governance', 'contractual governance', 'relational governance', 'relational governance', 'environment']",legal effectiveness networking

"Service interactions run a gamut from an instrumental self-focus to full social appreciation. Observing another customer's incivility toward a frontline employee can emphasize social concerns as guiding principles for the observer's own service interaction. Five studies test these dynamics; the results reveal that an incivility incident leads observers to prioritize social over market concerns. This reprioritization becomes manifest in a subsequent service interaction through increased feelings of warmth toward the employee who experienced incivility. In turn, feelings of warmth prompt observers to provide emotional support to the affected employee. Yet such prosocial inclinations are less likely when an employee is held responsible for or reciprocates incivility. Finally, this article also examines the effects of different employee reaction strategies on observers' inferences about the employee and the service firm, showing that observers are most positively disposed toward the employee and the firm when the former reacts to incivility with a polite reprimand. Together, the results suggest that, contrary to past theorizing, observing customers may contribute to employee well-being, contingent on appropriate employee responses. Notably, the commonly prescribed polite, submissive employee reaction that requires emotional labor may not be the most desirable reactionneither for the employee nor for the firm.","['customer incivility', 'third-party observers', 'employee reaction', 'market versus social mind set', 'consumer misbehaviorEMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION', 'MECHANICAL TURK', 'EMPLOYEE', 'WORK', 'IMPACT', 'ENCOUNTERS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'AGGRESSION', 'BURNOUT', 'SUPPORT']","['employee reaction', 'employee reaction', 'employee', 'support']",service self incivility
"As employees are among firms' most important resources and labor markets are facing serious labor shortages, firm-level collective turnover is one of the most important challenges facing organizations. Context-emergent turnover theory provides a theoretical framework for the performance implications of collective turnover and argues that context, and in particular, firm size, plays a crucial role in the collective turnover-performance relationship. Yet, the moderating role of firm size remains undertheorized, empirically understudied, and thus, unclear. Based on the resource-based view of the firm, we develop a theoretical framework for two competing perspectives (a negative and a positive one) on the role of firm size and put forward the firm's knowledge intensity as a crucial additional moderator. The main premise is that whereas firm size determines what resources firms have to successfully cope with turnover, knowledge intensity determines the resources firms need to do so. We propose a three-way interaction, suggesting that firm size reinforces the harmful effect of turnover in highly knowledge-intensive firms and buffers it in firms with low levels of knowledge intensity. Using a unique multi-industry and longitudinal administrative data set of 6,913 Belgian firms (2012-2016), we find support for these assumptions. This study highlights the importance of the context in which firms have to deal with turnover, and it spurs researchers to go beyond studying turnover in narrow study contexts, to take into account the interplay among different but intertwined organizational contingencies, and to acknowledge both the quantitative (how many employees leave) and qualitative components (who leaves) of turnover.","['collective turnover', 'context-emergent turnover theory', 'firm size', 'knowledge intensity', 'firm performanceHUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT', 'PERCEIVED ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT', 'EMPLOYEE TURNOVER', 'VOLUNTARY TURNOVER', 'WORK PRACTICES', 'LABOR-MARKETS', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'LEVEL', 'RATES', 'UNIT']","['collective turnover', 'collective turnover', 'context emergent turnover theory', 'context emergent turnover theory', 'context emergent turnover theory', 'context emergent turnover theory', 'firm size', 'firm size', 'knowledge intensity', 'knowledge intensity', 'labor markets', 'labor markets', 'level']",collective turnover firm size knowledge intensity industry
"Although marketing researchers have emphasized the interactive nature of service encounters, there has been scant research regarding how dyadic behaviors in a service encounter are interrelated. The authors recognize two distinct forms of dyadic interdependency: process interdependency, in which each party's enactment of behavior influences the other's enactment of behavior, and outcome interdependency, in which the impact of each party's behavior on service outcome depends on the other party's behavior. Using the interpersonal circumplex model and its related concept of complementarity, the authors examine both forms of dyadic interdependency by directly observing provider client interpersonal behaviors in a natural frontline service setting over an extended period. The findings on process interdependency indicate that dyadic behaviors elicit or inhibit each other largely in a complementary manner. The findings on outcome interdependency show that, in general, complementary interactions between the provider and client enhance the client's satisfaction, whereas anticomplementary interactions dampen the client's satisfaction.","['frontline service encounters', 'dyadic interdependency', 'interpersonal complementarityINTERPERSONAL COMPLEMENTARITY', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'QUALITY', 'COMMUNICATION', 'TRANSACTIONS', 'SATISFACTION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EXPERIENCE', 'HOSTILITY']","['dyadic interdependency', 'dyadic interdependency', 'behavior', 'satisfaction']",interdependency circumplex model
"The proliferation of new touchpoints empowers today's customers to design their own journey from search to purchase. To address this new complexity, we segment customers by their use of specific touchpoints in the customer journey, investigate the association of several covariates with segment membership, consider the rise of mobile devices as potential game changers of existing segments, and explore how the relationships among product satisfaction, journey satisfaction, customer inspiration, and customer loyalty differ across segments. Based on anticipated utility theory and using latent class analyses on large-scale data from two samples of 2,443 and 2,649 journeys, we identify five time-consistent segments-store-focused shoppers, pragmatic online shoppers, extensive online shoppers, multiple touchpoint shoppers, and online-to-offline shoppers-that differ considerably in their touchpoint and mobile device usage, their segment-specific covariates, and their search and purchase patterns. The five segments remain unchanged in the two data sets even though the usage of mobile devices has increased substantially. Furthermore, we find that the relationships between various loyalty antecedents and customer loyalty differ between the segments. The insights from this paper help retailers develop segment-specific customer journey strategies.

"Co-development with customers attracts considerable interest as a means to improve companies' product innovativeness and performance. Forward-thinking companies integrate co-development within their business models, but many remain uncertain about which levers best foster its implementation. This study therefore takes a top-down perspective on ways to stimulate co-development with customers. Relying on boundary theory and its wider contextualization in relation to resource dependence theory, the authors argue that an innovation-oriented strategy, combined with transformational and transactional leadership, represents senior management levers for driving general openness and providing strategic directions for innovation, which then helps bridge the boundary with customers and facilitate the co-development of new products. Data from 135 managers and 415 subordinates reveal that some senior management levers can foster co-development. Specifically, the results of the hierarchical regression analyses confirm the hypothesized positive interaction effect of innovation-oriented strategy and transformational leadership, whereas the combination of innovation-oriented strategy and transactional leadership is not beneficial. The strength of innovation-oriented strategy as an important senior management lever differs for goods and services, which is not the case for the other two levers. Finally, this study provides a more fine-grained perspective on the new product frequency outcomes of co-development, by relying on organizational learning theory. Most research is restricted to linear relationships, but the current investigation unveils an inverted U-shaped relationship between co-development and companies' new product frequency. Hence, companies can profit from co-development at lower and medium levels, but the common notion of the more, the better does not apply to an unlimited degree for co-development.","['nanPRODUCT PROGRAM INNOVATIVENESS', 'BOUNDARY SPANNING ROLES', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'INFORMATION OVERLOAD', 'SERVICE DEVELOPMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'SUPPLIER', 'IMPACT']","['transformational leadership', 'transformational leadership', 'performance', 'management']",co performance co development organizational learning
"Research on entrepreneurial failure has primarily addressed two issues: the causes and potential consequences of business failure for entrepreneurs. However, few studies are devoted to rethinking the concept of entrepreneurial failure as a multiform phenomenon that involves various configurations. This article extends the understanding of entrepreneurial failure by examining the different configurations that can occur and the associated profiles of failing entrepreneurs. To that end, two major approaches to configuration-theoretically derived typology and empirically grounded taxonomy have been used to offer a more nuanced view of entrepreneurial failure. This study's findings provide a starting point for a stronger theoretical grounding of research that goes beyond the traditional interpretation of entrepreneurial failure and opens new avenues of research opportunities to explore and compare the different configurations that have emerged and identify the possible dynamism and trajectories among these configurations.

"Although prior research generally holds that role clarity is affected by both individual characteristics and organizational contexts, current conceptual or empirical models do not reflect the multilevel nature of these antecedents. A more complete understanding of how role clarity emanates from different organizational levels is necessary to help prevent poor job performance and other harmful consequences of ambiguous role expectations. To address this, I begin this research by investigating the effects of internal work locus of control, general self-efficacy, and leader-member exchange on role clarity. With respect to the cross-level effects, I focus on the roles of a manager's control style and the organization's strategy-making pattern. Analyses of a multi-industry, multilevel dataset collected from 724 employees and 124 managers in 25 organizations in Finland suggest that all of the individual-level independent variables and a deliberate strategy-making pattern improve role clarity. However, a deliberate strategy-making pattern negatively moderates the relationship between general self-efficacy and role clarity. Finally, even though an outcome-based control system causes role ambiguity among employees in most functional areas, it may be an effective driver of role clarity among employees in sales jobs.","['control beliefs', 'leader-member exchange', 'managerial control systems', 'personnel management', 'role clarity', 'strategy-makingLEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'LAISSEZ-FAIRE LEADERSHIP', 'SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY', 'SELF-EFFICACY', 'ROLE AMBIGUITY', 'ROLE-CONFLICT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'GOOD CITIZENS', 'ROLE STRESS']","['leader member exchange', 'leader member exchange', 'leader member exchange', 'role clarity', 'role clarity', 'self efficacy', 'self efficacy', 'role ambiguity', 'role ambiguity', 'job performance', 'job performance']",models multilevel consequences
"This study examines why retail price promotion strategies vary across retail sectors and across firms within sectors. Using hierarchical linear modeling and a sample of 38 firms from 11 retail sectors, the authors investigate how two sector-level characteristics, related to product assortment perishability and heterogeneity, and three firm-level characteristics, related to retailer differentiation, number of stores, and average store size, influence price promotion decisions. The results indicate that assortment heterogeneity moderates the positive influence of perishability on price promotion activity; scale and scope also have significant effects. These results offer fresh insight into the ongoing debate surrounding stable versus promotional pricing, suggesting that the benefits of a particular strategy are driven largely by a complex interaction between sector-level characteristics as well as firm-level cost advantages.

"This study proposes an e-service resource bundle (E-SRB) as an antecedent of electronic service channel (e-channel) success in small retail service providers. The E-SRB indicates a collection of three resources: e-market acuity, e-IT competence, and e-service agility. Given the interdependence of these three resources in delivering quality e-services, the authors hypothesize about their complementarity and its positive effect on performance. The results of this structural equation modeling using survey data show support for the proposed hypotheses, demonstrating that the E-SRB positively influences e-channel performance. The performance impact is not limited to perceived financial performance but extends to self-reported dollar-based sales and profits. These results have theoretical implications when it comes to linking e-service quality to financial performance. They also carry managerial implications for small-scale e-retailing, where limited resources can seriously impede the full use of the e-channel.

"Three experiments investigate how the interval between target items of information in an audio context influences recall under background conditions of music and silence. In experiment 1, when a goal-directed learning task encouraged allocation of resources to the message, recall increased linearly for both background conditions as the interval increased. However, under the incidental learning task used in experiment 2, increasing the interval from two to three seconds had a deleterious impact on recall, but only in the background silence condition. Experiment 3 suggested that this was due to a surplus of cognitive resources in the background silence condition producing interfering extracommunication thought. Results also support the theory presented that background music borrows resources from the processing of message information in an incidental learning task. Although music impairs processing of brand information and reduces recall at shorter intervals, relative to silence, it increases the interval preceding the onset of excess resources, delaying interfering thought.","['nanINTERFERENCE', 'INFORMATION', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'REPETITION', 'MUSIC', 'BRAND']","['information', 'music', 'brand']",music
"We propose a mediation model to explain the relationship between CEO humility and firm performance. Building on upper echelons, power, and paradox theories, we hypothesize that when a more humble CEO leads a firm, its top management team (TMT) is more likely to collaborate, share information, jointly make decisions, and possess a shared vision. The firm will also tend to have lower pay disparity between the CEO and the TMT. The humble CEO and TMT, in turn, will be more likely to adopt an ambidextrous strategic orientation, which will be associated with stronger firm performance. We tested the model by using both survey and archival data that were collected at multiple time points from 105 small-to-medium-sized firms in the computer software and hardware industry in the United States. Findings largely support our theoretical assertions, suggesting that CEO humility has important implications for firm processes and outcomes.","['CEO humility', 'firm performance', 'organizational ambidexterity', 'pay disparity', 'top management team integrationTEAM BEHAVIORAL INTEGRATION', 'HIGH-VELOCITY ENVIRONMENTS', 'CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY', 'TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MODEL']","['ceo humility', 'ceo humility', 'firm performance', 'firm performance', 'pay disparity', 'pay disparity', 'upper echelons', 'upper echelons', 'performance', 'management', 'model']",humility top management
"Anthropomorphizing a brand (i.e., imbuing a brand with humanlike features) serves as an important brand positioning strategy for marketing managers. This research identifies a key brand anthropomorphization strategy-positioning a brand as either oriented to interact with consumers or not. Managers generally rely on this brand interaction strategy to enhance consumer brand engagement regardless of the social context. However, given that consumers often experience brands in a social context, this research demonstrates that social crowdedness moderates the positive impact of interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands on consumer brand preferences. Specifically, the authors show that consumers' inferences of an anthropomorphized brand's intentionality to interact with them in a socially crowded context trigger greater social withdrawal, thereby resulting in lower preferences for the brand. The authors further demonstrate that the core negative effect of social crowdedness is contingent on the type of crowding (goal-related vs. goal-unrelated). In particular, a goal-related crowding decreases social withdrawal reactions, which, in turn, leads to greater preferences for interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands relative to brands with other positioning strategies. In contrast, the effect of social crowdedness on consumer preferences for interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands remains negative in goal-unrelated crowded settings.","['social crowdedness', 'brand anthropomorphization', 'interaction-oriented brands', 'social withdrawalCONSEQUENCES', 'WITHDRAWAL', 'CONSUMERS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'DENSITY', 'ATTITUDES', 'RESPONSES', 'SETTINGS', 'PRODUCT', 'PRIVACY']","['social crowdedness', 'social crowdedness', 'brand anthropomorphization', 'brand anthropomorphization', 'withdrawal', 'consumers', 'settings']",strategy consumers engagement
"The importance of strategic behavior in organizations has long been recognized. However, so far the literature has primarily focused on leaders' strategic behavior, largely ignoring followers' strategic behavior. In this paper, we take a follower trait perspective on strategic follower behavior, specifically focusing on how followers' dark triad traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) influence their strategic behavior. We argue that dark triad-related strategic follower behavior is likely to have negative effects for fellow organizational members and the organization as a whole. We also present red flag behaviors that may signal followers' tendencies to engage in shady strategic behaviors, then put forward factors that may mitigate or increase the occurrence of shady strategic behaviors by followers scoring high on dark triad traits, focusing especially on follower attributes and specifics of the organizational context. Finally, we discuss if and how followers' dark triad traits could benefit the organization and highlight emerging issues in research on strategic follower behavior.","['nanWORK BEHAVIOR', 'NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY', 'EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE', 'ETHICAL LEADERSHIP', 'MACHIAVELLIANISM', 'POWER', 'TRAITS', 'MODEL', 'SIDE', 'ORGANIZATIONS']","['machiavellianism', 'traits', 'organizations']",strategic behavior dark triad narcissism machiavellianism psychopathy
"Whereas the majority of research on board diversity explores the direct relationship between racial and gender diversity and firm performance, this paper investigates mediators that explain how board diversity is related to firm performance. Grounded in signalling theory and the behavioural theory of the firm, we suggest that this relationship operates through two mediators: firm reputation and innovation. In a sample of Fortune 500 firms, we find a positive relationship between board racial diversity and both firm reputation and innovation. We find that reputation and innovation both partially mediate the relationship between board racial diversity and firm performance. In addition, we find a positive relationship between board gender diversity and innovation.","['nanR-AND-D', 'CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP', 'NETWORK STRUCTURE', 'CEO DUALITY', 'DIRECTORS', 'REPUTATION', 'WOMEN']",['reputation'],diversity gender firm performance reputation
"The rapport between employees and customers represents a particularly salient issue in retail businesses characterized by significant interpersonal interactions. Although rapport relates significantly to customer satisfaction, loyalty, and word-of-mouth communication, the behaviors employees use to develop rapport receive minimal attention in marketing and management literature. Using research on rapport-building behaviors identified in other literature as a basis for investigation, this study investigates the extent to which such behaviors are relevant in commercial settings. With the critical incident technique, the authors identify rapport-building behaviors commonly used by retail employees in 388 service encounters. Analysis of 824 rapport-building behaviors described in these encounters confirms three categories suggested by previous research - uncommonly attentive, common grounding, and courteous behavior - and identifies two additional categories that have not been linked to rapport in retail settings, namely, connecting and information sharing behavior. The authors conclude with a discussion of managerial and research implications. (C) 2008 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"In this article, the authors explore the antecedents of currency choice in export transactions by U.S., Swedish, and Finnish firms. Using a framework adapted from exporting literature and negotiation theory, the authors examine relationships between the transaction currency and three sets of constructs, predicated in negotiation and bargaining literature, as well as performance measures. Results indicate a strong relationship between currency choice and process-related and firm characteristic measures. However, situational constraint factors do not exert much influence on transaction currency. The logistic regression model confirms these results with 83% correct classification. The authors demonstrate that the use of foreign currencies is related positively to export volume and transaction value but inversely affects export profit margin.","['nanMARKET ORIENTATION', 'NEGOTIATION STRATEGIES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CHANNELS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'FIRMS']","['performance', 'firms']",negotiation performance

"This paper explores whether and how social activists' challenges affect politicians' willingness to associate with targeted firms. We study the effect of public protest on corporate political activity using a unique database that allows us to analyze empirically the impact of social movement boycotts on three proxies for associations with political stakeholders: the proportion of campaign contributions that are rejected, the number of times a firm is invited to give testimony in congressional hearings, and the number of government procurement contracts awarded to a firm. We show that boycotts lead to significant increases in the proportion of refunded contributions, as well as decreases in invited congressional appearances and awarded government contracts. These results highlight the importance of considering how a firm's sociopolitical environment shapes the receptivity of critical non-market stakeholders. We supplement this analysis by drawing from social movement theory to extrapolate and test three key mechanisms that moderate the extent to which activists' challenges effectively disrupt corporate political activity: the media attention a boycott attracts, the political salience of the contested issue, and the status of the targeted firm.","['social movement boycotts', 'political economy', 'organizational image', 'corporate political activityLOCAL NEWSPAPER COVERAGE', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'REPUTATION', 'MOVEMENTS', 'POLICY', 'MOBILIZATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'GOVERNMENT', 'STRATEGY', 'AMERICAN']","['social movement boycotts', 'social movement boycotts', 'social movement boycotts', 'government']",activists firms impact
"Recent research emphasizes that corporate governance becomes critical during economic crises, when the incentives for expropriation of minority shareholders increase. Using the high-profile Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 and a sample of 566 firms from eight East Asian countries over 1996-1999, we examine the link between family control and agency costs evident in the cost of equity financing for firms. We find that, before the crisis, family control is unrelated to firms' equity financing costs, whereas, following the crisis, family control is related to a higher cost of equity. This suggests that the crisis made investors aware of the potential entrenchment of controlling families, prompting them to require a higher-equity premium from family firms. Our results are robust to various models of the cost of equity capital, additional firm-and country-level governance traits, and additional alternative explanations, including the presence of other types of large shareholders and potential survivorship bias. Our study contributes to our understanding of the corporate governance of family-controlled firms, especially during economic crises.

"Portfolio management is the set of activities that allows a firm to select, develop, and commercialize a pipeline of new products aligned with the firm's strategy that will enable it to continue to grow profitably over the long term. To appropriately manage the firm's new product portfolio, decisions must be made about which projects to fund, to what levels, at what point in time. Previous research has investigated portfolio management decisions as individually discrete decisions. Significant streams of research have investigated both project selection and project termination decisions. This research project shows, however, that portfolio decision making may be better understood if it is considered as an integrated system of processes that considers these decisions simultaneously, along with other decisions such as those to continue a project with reduced funding. Using in-depth data from four diverse case studies, we use a grounded theory approach to develop a general model of how firms make new product portfolio decisions. According to the findings from these cases, effective portfolio decision-making processes produce a portfolio mindset, focus effort on the right projects, and allow agile decision making across the portfolio's set of projects. Effective portfolio decision making is the result of the interaction between three types of decision-making processes that managers use in making decisions: evidence-, power-, and opinion-based. Being able to use each of these types of processes to make decisions depends upon having the data inputs that they require. Three domain-based decision input-generating processes (i.e., cross-functional collaboration, practices of critical thinking, and practices of market immersion) are associated with making evidence-based portfolio decisions. In addition, organizational politics produces the inputs that are associated with power-based portfolio decision making, while managerial intuition is associated with opinion-based portfolio decision making. Firm cultural factors, including trust, collective ambition, and leadership style, are associated with how these evidence-, power- and opinion-based processes are combined into an overall portfolio decision making process, and whether the firm's processes are more rational and objectively made, or more politically and intuitively made. The article presents propositions for how the decision-making processes interact in their associations with decision-making effectiveness.","['nanR-AND-D', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'NPD PRACTICES', 'DEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS', 'LEARNING ORIENTATION', 'INNOVATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'BENCHMARKING', 'MINTZBERG,HENRY']",['management'],portfolio management
"Market basket analysis (MBA), also known as association rule mining or affinity analysis, is a data-mining technique that originated in the field of marketing and more recently has been used effectively in other fields, such as bioinformatics, nuclear science, pharmacoepidemiology, immunology, and geophysics. The goal of MBA is to identify relationships (i.e., association rules) between groups of products, items, or categories. We describe MBA and explain that it allows for inductive theorizing; can address contingency (i.e., moderated) relationships; does not rely on assumptions such as linearity, normality, and residual equal variance, which are often violated when using general linear model-based techniques; allows for the use of data often considered unusable and messy in management research (e.g., data not collected specifically for research purposes); can help build dynamic theories (i.e., theories that consider the role of time explicitly); is suited to examine relationships across levels of analysis; and is practitioner friendly. We explain how the adoption of MBA is likely to help bridge the much-lamented micro-macro and science-practice divides. We also illustrate that use of MBA can lead to insights in substantive management domains, such as human resource management (e.g., employee benefits), organizational behavior (e.g., dysfunctional employee behavior), entrepreneurship (e.g., entrepreneurs' identities), and strategic management (e.g., corporate social responsibility). We hope our article will serve as a catalyst for the adoption of MBA as a novel methodological approach in management research.","['research design', 'methodology', 'data analysisMONTE-CARLO', 'ASSOCIATION', 'MICROFOUNDATIONS', 'HYPOTHESES', 'ALGORITHMS', 'REGRESSION', 'VARIABLES', 'BEHAVIOR', 'CHOICES', 'MODELS']","['association', 'behavior']",basket analysis research
"Among the many items online retailers sell, some stand out as best sellers and are often sold at considerable discounts. Best seller discounting can encourage customer traffic and the purchase of a basket of other products in the same transaction. Although most studies treat retailers as symmetric, the cross-selling potential is generally asymmetric across retailers, since some online retailers have more products to sell. In addition, the cross-selling effect works both ways customers intending to buy a best seller may buy other items in their shopping basket, while other customers intending to buy a basket may buy a best seller while visiting the retailer. The authors model the pricing implications of this rich variety of asymmetric cross-selling, with both best sellers and typical baskets acting as traffic generators and cross-sold products. The common wisdom that loss leader pricing leads to neither a significant increase in store traffic nor an increase in profits does not apply in an asymmetric case where one retailer has more products to cross-sell. The cross-selling potential of products even far down the best seller list is demonstrated. Empirical analyses provide support for key findings of the theoretical model using book pricing and sales rank data from multiple online retailers.

"This article contributes to the literature on board effectiveness by being perhaps the first to systematically examine how the nature of outside directors' prior experience, and resulting expertise, will influence the performance of a focal firm's strategic initiatives. Our theoretical model is grounded in the psychological literature on expertise and its role in group decision making effectiveness. We focus on outside director expertise in acquisition decision making, and its implications for the performance of the acquisitions Our conceptual framework indicates that directors will develop expertise in making particular kinds of acquisition decisions (e.g., related or unrelated acquisitions or acquisitions in specific industries or product markets) through their past experiences at other firms with decisions about those specific types of acquisitions. and we predict that this experience and expertise will have positive effects on the performance of a focal firm's acquisitions. Me extend our theoretical model to consider the conditions under which relevant director experience will prove most beneficial. Our model predicts that outside director acquisition expertise will deliver the greatest benefits when the focal firm's board is independent from management. We find empirical support for all of our hypotheses. lit considering how and when director experience and resulting expertise may influence the performance of corporate acquisitions, our theory and results help to highlight a potential second main focus for research on the long-standing question of what factors render boards of directors effective.

"When people experience threats to important aspects of their self-concept (e.g., power, intelligence, sociability), they often compensate by consuming products that symbolize success, mastery, or competence on the threatened self-domain (within-domain compensatory consumption). Our research examines whether such compensatory consumption is effective in repairing the self-concept. Across seven experiments, we show that whether compensatory consumption is effective depends on the extent to which the connection between the compensatory products and the threatened domains is made explicit. When the connections are made explicit (e.g., through product names and marketing slogans), self-repair is impeded, but when the connections are only implicit (product is inherently symbolic of self-threat domain), self-repair can be successful. We further show that these differential effects of product connection explicitness are mediated by rumination: explicit connections induce rumination about the self-threat, which undermines self-repair, whereas implicit connections cause no rumination, facilitating self-repair. Our research provides a reconciliation of conflicting findings on self-repair in previous research, and also shows that despite the differences in efficacy, consumers compensate regardless of whether product connections are implicit or explicit, which has implications for consumer well-being.","['self-concept', 'identity', 'compensatory consumption', 'materialism', 'self-threat', 'self-discrepancySOCIAL EXCLUSION', 'CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION', 'CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR', 'MATERIALISM', 'POWER', 'PEOPLE', 'ESTEEM', 'PERILS']","['self concept', 'self concept', 'compensatory consumption', 'compensatory consumption', 'self threat', 'self threat', 'power', 'people']",self concept explicitness rumination rumination well being
"Research SummaryThis research addresses firms' use of external knowledge sources to develop patented inventions and explores the validity of patent citations as an indicator of interfirm knowledge flows. By comparing patent citations with primary data reported by the inventors, we uncover systematic measurement errors in patent citations and show that they depend on the firms' patent strategies (e.g., to reduce the risk of imitation or litigation), the source of knowledge employed (e.g., competitors, users), the technology of the underlying invention, and the institutional characteristics of the patent system. Our findings about the role of these factors in external knowledge sourcing and citing propensity highlight the importance of firms' strategic behavior and offer novel insights for the use of patent citations as an indicator of knowledge flows. Managerial SummaryFirms' open innovation strategies rely on the sourcing of knowledge from other organizations. Tracing these knowledge flows is difficult, such that the empirical research on this matter typically uses citations that patents make to prior art in order to track them. However, patent citations might be added also for reasons other than the actual transfer of knowledge. We use primary information from a large survey of inventors to assess the accuracy of patent citations to measure knowledge flows, and we find evidence of measurement errors that depend on the applicants' patent strategies, the type of knowledge sources used, the filing jurisdiction, and the technology of the underlying invention. We offer insights to evaluate the settings in which patent citations are a reliable measure of knowledge flows.","['external search strategy', 'knowledge flows', 'measurement error', 'patent citations', 'patent strategyPRIOR ART', 'INNOVATION', 'SEARCH', 'SPILLOVERS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'INVENTORS', 'MOBILITY', 'OPENNESS', 'PARADOX', 'IMPACT']","['knowledge flows', 'knowledge flows', 'measurement error', 'measurement error', 'patent citations', 'patent citations', 'innovation', 'search', 'inventors']",patent citations sourcing open innovation
"Although past studies have paid considerable attention to firms' reputations, few have investigated the actions that firms take following a reputation-damaging event. We identify firms involved in financial earnings restatements and examine whether naming a successor CEO with specific qualifies serves to signal the seriousness of a firm's efforts to restore its reputation. Using theories of market signaling, we argue that attributes of successor CEOs significantly influence the reactions of key external constituencies. In particular, firms with more severe restatement tend to name successors who have prior CEO or turnaround experience and a more elite education. The naming of such successors results in more positive reactions from the stock market, financial analysts, and mass media. We argue that these attributes send messages to stakeholders and the broader public about the CEO's credibility and the firm's efforts.","['nanTOP MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL REPUTATION', 'CERTIFICATION CONTESTS', 'EARNINGS RESTATEMENTS', 'EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MARKET', 'MEDIA', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DISMISSAL']","['earnings restatements', 'earnings restatements', 'market', 'media']",reputations earnings restatements

We use the case method to identify the international adaptation behaviours of six new ventures and managers' explanations regarding those adaptations. We infer two different profiles of managerial goal orientation. The goal orientation associated with proving one's competence is common across managers, but firms only pursue international adaptation if their managers also hold a learning goal orientation. In contrast, if managers have the goal orientation associated with avoiding failure, firm-level adaptation is not apparent.","['International entrepreneurship', 'Internationalization', 'Adaptation', 'Goal orientation theory', 'International new ventureENTREPRENEURIAL FIRMS', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'GLOBAL MINDSET', 'OPPORTUNITY-RECOGNITION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH', 'STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS', 'MANAGERIAL COGNITION', 'RETHINKING RESEARCH', 'UPPSALA MODEL', 'PERFORMANCE']","['adaptation', 'goal orientation theory', 'goal orientation theory', 'goal orientation theory']",international ventures
"We address a grand economic challenge faced by women in rural India. We consider the interplay of women's social networks (ties to family, to community, and to men in power), information and communication technology (ICT) use, and time in relating to the initiation and success of women's entrepreneurial ventures. Results from a seven-year field quasi-experiment in 20 rural villages in India support the model. Ties to family and community positively, and to men in power negatively, relate to ICT use, entrepreneurial activity, and entrepreneurial profit. ICT intervention also strongly impacts entrepreneurship, with 160 new businesses in the 10 intervention villages compared to 40 in the controls. Results also demonstrate the dynamic interplay of social networks and ICT use. For ties to family and community, the amplification effect is such that the highest levels of entrepreneurial activity and success are observed among women with high centrality and ICT use-effects that increase over time. For ties to men in power, ICT use is associated with increased entrepreneurial activity only when these ties are low, but these interactive temporary temporal patterns do not emerge for profit. We address implications for the grand challenges of empowering women in less developed countries.","['nanSOCIAL NETWORKS', 'DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES', 'INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY', 'DIGITAL INEQUALITY', 'GENDER', 'FAMILY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SUPPORT', 'SUCCESS', 'ORGANIZATIONS']","['family', 'support', 'success']",social networks ties men in power technology ict time entrepreneurial ventures field quasi experiment entrepreneurship
"Research summary: Reorganization has been proposed as a key dynamic capability. This study compares the performance outcomes of two forms of reorganization, differing in their pervasiveness: organizational restructuring and organizational reconfiguration. Our dynamic panel data analysis of large U.S. corporations between 1985 and 2004 finds contrasting performance outcomes for these two forms of reorganization: in general, the more pervasive restructuring is associated with positive performance outcomes, while the more limited reconfiguration is associated with negative performance outcomes. However, outcomes vary by environment. Consistent with dynamic capabilities theory, we find evidence that in dynamic environments reconfiguration outcomes turn positive, while restructuring outcomes turn negative. We discuss implications for dynamic capabilities theory and managerial policy.Managerial summary: Firms need to reorganize in order to adapt to change. This study compares the financial performance consequences of two forms of reorganization: organizational restructurings and organizational reconfigurations. Restructurings involve fundamental change in organizational principles and are typically irregular; reconfigurations involve incremental change and are frequent. Examining a set of large U.S. corporations, we find these two forms of reorganization have contrasting financial consequences, depending on context. In the general case, fundamental restructurings have positive consequences, while incremental reconfigurations have negative consequences. However, this general result reverses in specifically dynamic environments, where reconfigurations are positive financially, while restructurings are negative. We conclude that the relative frequency of reconfigurations helps adaptation in dynamic environments. Managers should choose forms of reorganization according to the rate of environmental change.

"Although research has examined the social media-shareholder value link, the role of consumer mindset metrics in this relationship remains unexplored. To this end, drawing on the elaboration likelihood model and accessibility/diagnosticity perspective, the authors hypothesize varying effects of owned and earned social media (OSM and ESM) on brand awareness, purchase intent, and customer satisfaction and link these consumer mindset metrics to shareholder value (abnormal returns and idiosyncratic risk). Analyzing daily data for 45 brands in 21 sectors using vector autoregression models, they find that brand fan following improves all three mindset metrics. ESM engagement volume affects brand awareness and purchase intent but not customer satisfaction, while ESM positive and negative valence have the largest effects on customer satisfaction. OSMincreases brand awareness and customer satisfaction but not purchase intent, highlighting a nonlinear effect of OSM. Interestingly, OSM is more likely to increase purchase intent for high involvement utilitarian brands and for brands with higher reputation, implying that running a socially responsible business lends more credibility to OSM. Finally, purchase intent and customer satisfaction positively affect shareholder value.","['marketing-finance interface', 'owned social media', 'earned social media', 'consumer decision journey', 'shareholder valueWORD-OF-MOUTH', 'USER-GENERATED CONTENT', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'BRAND EQUITY', 'IMPACT', 'ONLINE', 'INFORMATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PERSISTENCE']","['earned social media', 'earned social media', 'earned social media', 'customer satisfaction', 'customer satisfaction', 'online']",media shareholder value social media brand awareness customer satisfaction abnormal returns risk engagement
"The authors' research in Hungary during the period of transition to a market economy provides an opportunity to examine the evolving relationships between consumer product knowledge and its antecedents, including advertising, personal search, interpersonal sources, and brand experience. Their findings, based on survey data collected in Budapest in 1992 and 1998, indicate that the market information variables explain more variance in consumer knowledge later rather than earlier in the transition. Advertising is an important predictor of consumer knowledge later but not earlier in the transition, personal search is important at both times, and interpersonal sources are not important in either time period; brand experience is negatively related to knowledge earlier in the transition and positively related later in the transition. This study allows one to begin to understand the boundary conditions associated with studies conducted in developed economies. Managerial implications for firms investing in transitional economies are presented.","['product knowledge', 'information search', 'advertising', 'transitional economies', 'HungaryPRODUCT CATEGORIES', 'OPINION LEADERSHIP', 'EXTERNAL SEARCH', 'CHOICE', 'EXPERIENCE', 'DIMENSIONS', 'FRAMEWORK', 'LOYALTY', 'THINK', 'MODEL']","['product knowledge', 'product knowledge', 'advertising', 'transitional economies', 'transitional economies', 'experience']",advertising
"This meta-analysis combines 369 correlations on the effects of humor in advertising and thus quantifies, updates, and expands previous literature reviews on the effects of humor in advertising. In line with previous reviews, the meta-analytic correlations demonstrate that humor in advertising significantly enhances A(AD), attention, and positive affect. Contrary to the assumptions of previous reviews, there is no evidence that humor impacts positive or negative cognitions, and liking of the advertiser. The meta-analytic findings clarify some ambiguous prior conclusions: humor significantly reduces source credibility, enhances positive affect, A(BR) and purchase intention. The decline from lower order to higher order communication effects is particularly strong, with the effect size of the impact of humor on A(AD) being twice as large as the effect size for A(BR). This impact of humor in advertising has been rather stable over the past decades. A moderator analysis reveals, however, that the findings of academic humor research are somewhat biased. As for the underlying theory, the positive and linear relationship between the funniness of the ad and brand attitudes supports an affective mechanism underlying the impact of humor in advertising.","['Humor in advertising', 'Meta-analysis', 'GeneralizationPROGRAM CONTEXT', 'META-ANALYSIS', 'IMPACT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'RESPONSES', 'ATTITUDE', 'MODEL', 'AD', 'ADVERTISEMENTS', 'ANTECEDENTS']","['humor in advertising', 'humor in advertising', 'humor in advertising', 'meta analysis', 'meta analysis', 'meta analysis', 'meta analysis', 'impact', 'attitude', 'ad']",meta analysis credibility purchase intention
"For more than a decade, researchers have explored the benefits of eliminating organizational boundaries between participants in the new product development (NPD) process. In turn, companies have revamped their NPD processes and organizational structures to deploy cross-functional teams. These efforts toward interfunctional integration have produced a more responsive NPD process, but they don't represent the endgame in the quest for more effective NPD. What's next after the interfunctional walls come down? Pointing out that many high-tech firms have already taken such steps as integrating customers and suppliers into the NPD process, Avan Jassawalla and Hemant Sashittal suggest that such firms need to go beyond integration and start thinking in terms of collaboration. Using information from a study of 10 high-tech industrial firms, they identify factors that seem to increase cross-functional collaboration in NPD, and they develop a conceptual framework that relates those factors to the level of cross-functional collaboration achieved in the NPD process. Compared to integration, collaboration is described as a more complex, higher intensity cross-functional linkage. in addition to high levels of integration, their definition of cross-functional collaboration includes the sense of an equal stake in NPD outcomes, the absence of hidden agendas, and a willingness on the part of participants to understand and accept differences while remaining focused on the organization's common objectives. Collaboration also involves synergy-that is, the NPD outcomes exceed the sum of the capabilities of the individual participants in the NPD process. Their framework suggests that structural mechanisms such as cross-functional reams can provide significant increases in NPD-related interfunctional integration. However; high levels of integration do not necessarily equate to high levels of collaboration. Characteristics of the organization and the participants also affect the level of collaboration. For example, achieving a high level of collaboration depends art participants who contribute an openness to change, a willingness to cooperate, and a high level of trust. Their framework also points to key organizational factors that affect the level of collaboration-for example, the priority that senior management gives to NPD and the level of autonomy afforded to participants in the NPD process.","['nanR-AND-D', 'CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COOPERATION', 'D-MARKETING INTERFACE', 'DEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS', 'INNOVATION', 'INTEGRATION', 'COMMUNICATION', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MECHANISMS']","['integration', 'mechanisms']",development framework

There has also been an active establishment of innovative business models to tap into the general demand for high-speed Internet access by creating wireless broadband networks based on clusters of WLANs. This paper outlines the key factors driving Wi-Fi growth and describes competing technologies. Using mini-cases, it explores the strategies of four organizations involved in developing wireless broadband networks (Boingo, Joltage Networks, Sputnik, and NYC Wireless). Although operating in the same market, these organizations offer significantly different access methodologies and services.

"Because stock markets in emerging economies are relatively new, under-regulated, and often segmented, investors' responses to public announcements firms in these economies may differ from responses in developed economies' stock markets. We draw on the institutional and corporate governance literatures to explain investor reactions to announcements of international strategic alliances (ISAs) between foreign and emerging-market firms. We argue that emerging economies' stock markets positively value ISAs; however, information leakages due to weak regulatory environments siphon off the good news before the ISA announcement date. The level of state ownership of publicly traded firms and the nationality of foreign partners both affect the size and timing of market reactions.","['information leakages', 'insider trading', 'international strategic alliance', 'stock market', 'state ownership', 'event study', 'China', 'emerging-market firm', 'emerging marketsEVENT', 'INFORMATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'INSTITUTIONS', 'INVESTMENT', 'SELECTION', 'RETURNS', 'COSTS', 'FIRM']","['information leakages', 'information leakages', 'international strategic alliance', 'international strategic alliance', 'international strategic alliance', 'stock market', 'stock market', 'state ownership', 'state ownership', 'emerging market firm', 'emerging market firm', 'emerging market firm', 'information', 'ownership', 'firm']",corporate governance international strategic alliances

"We analyze whether firms prefer collocating with incumbent firms when choosing among markets to enter, highlighting the role of resource-seeking as a motivation for collocation. We propose that entrants will locate near others possessing resources that can spill over, but will avoid locations where existing firms will exploit spillovers without contributing. To test these propositions, we analyze the location decisions of 570 new hotels in Texas between 1992 and 2000. We find that hotels are attracted to markets with branded upscale hotels. Further, we find that owners of upscale hotels avoid markets with hotels without similar resources.

"Relatively few studies of entrepreneurs have examined the evolution of business ventures over a long period of time. This paper summarizes the fate of 250 technology-based companies founded in Northern California during the 1960s. The three outcomes studied are failure, merger, and continued operation. In addition, interviews with a dozenfounders of firms that survived the entire 20-year period shed light on the founders' own interpretations of why they succeeded. By 1988, 50% of the firms in the sampk had failed, 32% had merged or been acquired, and 18% had survived as independent businesses. There was a steady and occasionally sharp erosion in the number of survivors throughout the period. A striking finding was thatfully 78% of the surviving firms in 1988 still had one or more of the original founders in place. Among the factors predicting failure were product/market problems such as product timing difficulties, problems of product design, or inappropriate distribution channels; financial difficulties such as initial undercapitalization or problems with the venture capital relationship; and managerial/key employee problems such as imbalance in the management team or succumbing to the trappings of success. The firms in the data base which were subsequently merged or acquired exhibited a number of macro and micro characteristics. From a macro point of view, the merger/acquisition rates seem to have been lower than the national rate in the late 1960s, higher in the later 1970s, and similar in the 1980s. From a micro point of view, discernible patterns existed among acquired firms, such as size and year since founding. Interviews with surviving founders suggested that relations between founders, banking and credit problems, attempted takeovers, and international expansion were among the key crises that had to be overcome hy the surviving firms. Of particular interest was the diversity of motives for founding the business reported by the survivors. In addition to the desire to achieve wealth or to be independent, we heard mentioned loyalty to a product or technology (which would otherwise disappear) and commitment to satisfying a customer group. Also noted were founders who indicated that their career as an entrepreneur came about primarily by accident. Five themes emerging from the interviews were characterized by the surviving founders as business lessons learned: (1) know yourself, (2) love your product, (3) honor your customer, (4) treat your people well, and (5) keep your integrity. The interviews, in conjunction with the data on surviving firms, are useful in expanding our understan&ng of the type of person that starts a business and why some start-ups succeed over the long term. Particularly noteworthy is the number of firms who survived without ever growing larger. Theories of long-term entrepreneurial success may need to take risk aversion into account.","['nanFIRMS', 'SUCCESS', 'BUSINESS']","['success', 'business']",companies
"Examples of violations or betrayals of trust in organizations abound. Despite growing concern in organizations, relatively little theory exists regarding the dynamics of trust violations from the perpetrator's (rather than the victim's) perspective. We adopt the betrayer's perspective in this article and, drawing from multiple literatures, offer a conceptualization of betrayal, differentiating it from deviant and antisocial behaviors in organizations. Next, we propose a:typology of betrayal before focusing on the most common form: opportunistic betrayal. We then develop ct model of its antecedents and moderators and highlight the intrapersonal-; interpersonal-, and organization-level characteristics of the model's components. We end by discussing implications for theory, research, and practice.","['nanETHICAL DECISION-MAKING', 'MODEL', 'WORKPLACE', 'BEHAVIOR']","['model', 'behavior']",organizations antisocial behaviors
"Purpose - The paper seeks to discuss and develop SCM as a scientific discipline using different theories from non-logistics areas to explain interorganizational phenomena. it also attempts to establish a frame of reference that allows us to mitigate the gap between the current SCM research and practice and the theoretical explanations of how to structure and manage supply chains. Design/methodology/approach - The paper introduces three different perspectives that together will contribute to a broader understanding of SCM in practice: an economic perspective; a socio-economic perspective; and a strategic perspective. The theoretical framework is applied to two important research topics within SCM: third party logistics (TPL); and new product development (NPD). Findings - There is no such thing as a unified theory of SCM. Depending on the concrete situation, one can choose one theory as the dominant explanatory theory, and then complement it with one or several of the other theoretical perspectives. Research limitations/implications - The way the four theories complement one another is explored on a conceptual basis, but further research into this direction may explore more deeply how these alleged complementarities occur in practice, and how managers mould their decisions by these ideas. Practical implications - The four theories can provide normative support to important management decisions in supply chains, such as outsourcing, safeguards against opportunism, and alignment of incentives. Originality/value - The main contribution is that one cannot rely on one theoretical explanation when analyzing phenomena in SCM. It is neccessary to consider several theories and how they may complement one another in order to provide a more comprehensive view of SCM.","['supply chain management', 'product developmentRESOURCE-BASED-VIEW', 'TRANSACTION COST', 'MASS CUSTOMIZATION', 'PRODUCT', 'INTEGRATION', 'MODULARITY', 'LOGISTICS', 'FRAMEWORK', 'STRATEGY', 'FIRM']","['product', 'logistics', 'framework']",development management
"Perceptual discrimination is fundamental to rational choice in many product categories yet rarely examined in consumer research. The present research investigates discrimination as it pertains to consumers' ability to identify differences - or the lack thereof - among gustatory stimuli. Three experiments reveal systematic bias resulting from the presence of common visual and verbal product cues. Particularly noteworthy is the finding that the amount of bias induced by a subtle, nonevaluative cue can far exceed the bias induced by overt and well-established evaluative cues. In addition, the effects these cues have on perceptual discrimination diverge from the effects they have on preference.","['nanPRODUCT EXPERIENCE', 'JUDGMENTS', 'VOLUME', 'DISCRIMINATION', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'FLAVOR', 'BIAS']","['discrimination', 'bias']",cues
"This paper examines how value is created in horizontal mergers and acquisitions. More specifically, it examines the impact of post-acquisition asset divestiture and resource redeployment on the long-term performance of horizontal acquisitions. The data come from a detailed survey of acquiring firm managers and cover 253 horizontal mergers and acquisitions that were initiated by European and U.S. firms in manufacturing industries for the period 1988-1992. This study incorporates insights from the cost efficiency and resource-based theories to propose a model of the effects of asset divestiture and resource redeployment on long-term acquisition performance. Overall, our results show that both asset divestiture and resource redeployment cart contribute to acquisition performance, with, however, a significant risk of damaging acquisition performance when the divested assets and redeployed resources are those of the target.

"This study investigates the impact of entrepreneurial teams' external networks on their ventures' performance. We first argue that ventures whose entrepreneurial teams span many structural holes in their external advice networks experience higher performance. We then propose that network ties are not uniform in their effect, but rather are contingent on two distinct features of entrepreneurial teams: (i) their strategic consensus-extent of agreement on key goals and strategies within the team-and (ii) internal cohesion-extent of interpersonal friendships within the team. Finally, we propose that team demographics and team networks complement (rather than substitute) each other. Data from Indian software ventures provide support for these arguments. We extend entrepreneurship research by highlighting how venture teams' internal processes and external networks jointly shape performance outcomes. We also add to the literature on team networks by drawing attention to the role of strategic consensus as a distinct pathway through which teams can leverage their external networks.","['entrepreneurship', 'networks', 'teams', 'India', 'software industryTOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS', 'SOCIAL NETWORKS', 'DEMOGRAPHY', 'DIVERSITY', 'FIRM', 'GROWTH', 'COMPREHENSIVENESS', 'ORGANIZATION', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'RESOURCES']","['entrepreneurship', 'networks', 'teams', 'india']",ties
"Negative online product reviews generated by current users can influence potential adopters' new product evaluation and set up diffusion barriers. Integrating the social functions of emotion theory with the innovation diffusion context, this research proposes that the emotional intensity expressed in angry online reviews influences potential adopters' new product evaluation through two competitive routes (i.e., in an opposite direction): perceived problem seriousness in the review and perceived rationality of the reviewer, thus establishing two simultaneous mediations in the conceptual framework. Furthermore, this research suggests that the two mediations are moderated by product innovativeness. This investigation was completed in three experiments with consumers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Study 1 manipulated anger intensity in two levels expressed in a single negative review, using a smartphone as the reviewed new product. Study 2 employed a multi-review setting, including negative, neutral, and positive reviews, using an E-reader as the reviewed new product. The multi-review setting was also adopted in Study 3, where three levels of anger were manipulated. Three studies adopted an incrementally versus really new product version to manipulate innovativeness. Combined findings of the three studies support the proposed dual mediation processes. In addition, results show that the mediation effect of problem seriousness in the review is stronger for a really new product than an incrementally new product. This research extends the underpinning of innovation diffusion literature and provides managerial implications for new product launch management. First, it identifies that anger intensity expressed in a new product review socially influences a potential adopter's concurrent appraisals of the reviewed product and the reviewer. The two appraisal routes mediate the impact of anger intensity on new product evaluation in opposite directions. Second, the research explores and identifies which mediation route is more influential on new product evaluation when product innovativeness varies.","['nanWORD-OF-MOUTH', 'ONLINE CONSUMER REVIEWS', 'SERVICE ENCOUNTERS', 'SOURCE CREDIBILITY', 'INNOVATION', 'COMMUNICATION', 'DIFFUSION', 'IMPACT', 'SALES', 'METAANALYSIS']","['innovation', 'diffusion', 'impact']",product reviews new evaluation diffusion seriousness innovativeness mechanical turk mturk anger
"In this study, we attempt to understand how household budget allocations across various expenditure categories change when the economy is in recession or expansion. The common assumption is that a household's tastes would not change as a function of economic conditions and therefore any adjustments in expenditure patterns during economic contractions/expansions would simply be due to changes in the consumption budget. Standard economic models translate these budgetary effects into lateral movements along a set of fixed Engel curves, which relate category expenditure shares to total expenditures. We propose and test a conceptual framework based on the notion of relative consumption, which prescribes that, for any given total consumption budget, expenditure shares for positional goods/services will decrease during a recession, while shares for nonpositional goods/services will increase (i.e., shifting the entire Engel curve upward or downward, depending on the nature of the expenditure category and the economic conditions).","['nanFAMILY-LIFE CYCLE', 'CONSUMER EXPENDITURES', 'POSITIONAL CONCERNS', 'WORKING WIVES', 'CONSUMPTION', 'SERVICES', 'DECISIONS', 'RECESSION', 'PRODUCT', 'DEMAND']","['consumption', 'services', 'recession']",recession models curves services
"Firms increasingly rely on suppliers to perform tasks in new product development (NPD). Research has only recently begun to focus on the processes to manage this supplier development responsibility, and has hardly investigated how firms collect and analyze information regarding the cost and performance of alternative supplier offerings. Our study addresses this gap, through a field survey among 144 paired samples of project leaders and cost analysts involved in the same NPD projects. On the basis of literature and qualitative research, we conceptualize a substantive model. We first use a substantive validity assessment to vet the measures for the proposed constructs. We then test the substantive model with structural equation modeling using a multiple-sample analysis. The results strongly show that monetary quantification of differences and detail gathering play significant roles in successfully leveraging supplier development responsibility. The findings support the hypothesis that the extent of development responsibility that suppliers have leads the development team to a more focused monetary quantification of the differences in alternative supplier offerings. Monetary quantification of differences has a significant, positive effect on the extent of supporting-detail gathering and on the development speed of the project, whereas supporting-detail gathering has a significant, positive effect on the product advantage of the new product as well as development speed. These findings are robust across the two functional perspectives. Our study complements the literature on interfirm control and monitoring by demonstrating the effects of selective and focused output controls.","['nanPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'FIT INDEXES', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS', 'SOURCING DECISIONS', 'BLACK-BOX', 'INTEGRATION', 'DESIGN', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT']",['performance'],firms performance

"Conflict is created when business format franchisors penetrate existing markets with new outlets that increase system-wide sales, but negatively affect the sales and profits of existing franchisees. Territorial exclusivity contracts are used to manage channel conflict in such situations. We present a model to value territorial exclusivity from the perspective of both the franchisor and the franchisee. We show that under certain circumstances there is positive value to the franchisor by including the exclusivity clause in the contract and to the franchisee by purchasing this exclusivity. When this happens, the likelihood of franchisor-franchisee encroachment-related conflict is reduced. (c) 2008 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Through an inductive study of six corporate venture capital programs, we unravel how new organizational units resolve competing forces from two different institutional environments. The data suggest that the organizational structure of units that enter a new environment depends on whether they focus their isomorphism internally toward the parent (endoisomorphism) or externally toward the industry (exoisomorphism). The focus of isomorphism depends on whom the units seek legitimacy with and on the professionalization of their top management teams.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore servitization in the context of the service supply chain, particularly the effects of the relationship between the subsystem supplier and the end user on the supplier's as well as on the supply chain's ability to provide industrial services. In addition, it aims to present a solution to overcome the challenges of lack of this relationship. Design/methodology/approach - A case study incorporating an explorative design science approach identifies a theoretically novel and practically relevant problem in the field of service supply chain management. The study combines empirical data collection; systematic conceptualization of means and ends; evaluation of proposed solutions in iterative- and action-oriented cycles; and theoretical explanation of the observed phenomena and outcomes. Findings - By establishing a triadic operational model with an integrator and end user, the subsystem supplier can servitize within a supply chain in which the end user relationship is controlled by the integrator. This enables the combining of critical service provision capabilities: supplier's maintenance-related capabilities and integrator's end user access. Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed to determine the importance of managing the transition to subsystem suppliers in different types of industrial service supply chains. Because these observations and proposals are based on a single case study, the authors cannot draw conclusions as to how they apply to manufacturers in different problem situations. Practical implications - The paper presents a decision-making procedure that describes how a subsystem supplier opting for cooperation in the service supply chain can formulate a coherent set of triadic operational models with intermediaries and end users.

"A considerable amount of literature deals with the influence of institutions on entrepreneurship. But for all that, little is known about the interplay between institutions and personal determinants of entrepreneurship. In this paper, the empirical evidence that older people in transition economies have low engagement in entrepreneurial activity is the starting point for analyzing how institutions moderate the relationship between individual characteristics and entrepreneurial choice. The results show that the socioeconomic heritage of being exposed to socialism deters entrepreneurship, an effect that is more pronounced for (high)-impact entrepreneurship. Detailed analyses reveal that the effect is driven by devaluation of socialist work experience and the influence of socialism on mindset. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"The retailing of information media either in a pure digital form or bundled with the conventional form has become increasingly common in product categories such as books, newspapers, music, etc. A general problem with these media is that much of the content that they offer is common to both conventional and digital formats. This makes the media inherently substitutes, and limits the attractiveness to consumers of acquiring both formats. However, the electronic and print formats often have advantages over one another in specific usage situations. For example, a print book may be most suitable for casual reading, while an electronic version might be most suitable for locating specific passages. In this paper we investigate whether increased awareness of advantages that different forms may have over one another in different usage situations can increase demand for buying both items simultaneously. We do this through an experimental manipulation where participants are provided either with communications that emphasize using the different forms in different situations, or using the different forms in the same situations. Employing book and newspaper subscription categories, we find that the different usage situation manipulation does significantly increase intent to purchase both print and electronic forms as long as the second item is discounted. In addition, we provide evidence that communicating different usage situations and pricing the forms differentially are likely to be effective strategies in selling information product form bundles.

"In the People's Republic of China (PRC), consumers have recently shown a tendency to shift away from foreign products in preference for local offerings. Some commentators have speculated that this new market phenomenon is a result of government intervention, consumer ethnocentrism, and improvement in the quality of local products. In this study, the authors offer an alternative reason, which pertains to the fading symbolic value of foreign products in the PRC market. To provide support for their argument, Zhou and Hui present the results of a study of Chinese consumption behaviors involving a foreign, inconspicuous product item (Canadian pork sausage). By using such a privately consumed item, the authors attempt to demonstrate that symbolic benefits (such as modernity, prestige, and associations with foreign lifestyles) constitute one of the primary motivating forces of PRC consumers' purchases of products of nonlocal origin, including products that may not be commonly regarded as conspicuous. The results challenge the conventional wisdom that improvement in the qualify of local products is the main cause of the decreasing competitiveness of foreign products in the PRC. The authors also discuss implications for global marketers with respect to market adaptation and positioning strategies in the PRC.","['nanEXECUTIVE INSIGHTS', 'BRAND', 'STRATEGIES', 'PURCHASE', 'SEGMENTS', 'ORIGIN', 'MARKET']","['strategies', 'purchase', 'origin', 'market']",ethnocentrism

"While prominent corporate portfolio analysis tools such as the BCG GrowthShare Matrix took centre stage in the field of strategic management from the 1960s to the mid-1980s, this review of the literature shows that they have since then largely disappeared from the academic agenda, despite their practical relevance and widespread application. There may be two independent reasons for this apparent scholarly disdain: corporate portfolio analysis tools (a) may have been recognized as unsuitable owing to inherent flaws or superior alternative concepts or (b) may have become obsolete because of proof that corporate diversification is inferior to market diversification. Thus, this assessment is based on an extensive review of the most relevant academic literature on corporate portfolio analysis tools and on the constitutive diversificationperformance link published in leading management journals over the past five decades. The review reveals that research to date has not produced advanced tools based on an objective criticism of the original matrices, nor has corporate diversification as a precondition for corporate portfolio analysis proved to be inferior to market-based co-ordination mechanisms. Thus, this literature review constitutes a call for further academic research in the field of corporate portfolio analysis tools as well as corporate diversification.","['nanPRODUCT PORTFOLIO', 'DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY', 'BUSINESS DIVERSIFICATION', 'GLOBAL DIVERSIFICATION', 'SHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'AGENCY COSTS', 'TOBIN-Q', 'FIRM', 'PERFORMANCE', 'OWNERSHIP']",['performance'],corporate portfolio analysis tools
"Research summary: We contribute to the corporate political activity (CPA) literature by showing that investors value companies that host visits of high-ranking government officials (President and Premier). We argue that investors may value host official visits for two reasons: (1) the signal received about possibility of firm accessing government-controlled resources via promotion or protection; and (2) the certification effect from such high-powered visitors elevating the firm's reputation and legitimacy. Results from an event study analysis of 84 high-ranking government official visits in China from 2003 to 2011 indicate that investors responded positively to host firms as reflected by stock market performance. Furthermore, the greatest positive reactions accrued to firms experiencing weaker prior period financial performance and to firms that are privately compared to state-controlled. Managerial summary: Do visits by high-ranking government officials influence firm stock market performance? Studying a sample of Chinese public firms that hosted 84 visits by the Chinese President and the Premier from 2003 to 2011, we find that investors reacted positively to such visits compared with a group of non-host firms from the same industry and with similar financial performance and size. In addition, firms with weaker prior financial performance and private firms benefit the most from hosting such visits. Our findings imply that hosting visits of high-ranking government officials can signal future government-controlled resource inflows and boost host firms' reputation and legitimacy.

"Recent research has documented how exchanges between buyers and sellers are frequently embedded in social relationships. An unresolved question, however, is the extent to which such relationships protect incumbent suppliers from new competitors and their marketing programs. The authors develop a conceptual framework of how relationship and marketing variables influence choice of supplier and test the framework empirically in the context of business-to-business services. The results show that interpersonal relationships between buyers and suppliers serve as a switching barrier but are considerably less important than both firm-level switching costs and marketing variables. Moreover, unlike switching costs, interpersonal relationships do not play the frequently mentioned role of a buffer against price and product competition. Finally, the authors show that buyers and suppliers hold systematically different views of the determinants of switching.","['nanCONSUMER TRADE-OFFS', 'VERTICAL INTEGRATION', 'SWITCHING BEHAVIOR', 'PRODUCT QUALITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'DISSOLUTION', 'SERVICES', 'DETERMINANTS', 'INDUSTRY', 'SYSTEMS']","['services', 'determinants']",

"This paper argues that supply chain management sourcing strategies are unlikely to be implemented successfully by many organisations because of a lack of internal buy-in and non-conducive external power regime structures. Furthermore, the paper contends that many of those arguing the case for win-win outcomes from buyer and supplier relationship management fail to properly define or conceptualise what the concept of mutuality means. The paper contends that mutuality and the search for value capture (profitability) are not fully commensurable in business relationships, but that, since ''win-win is not an absolute but a variable concept, business relationships can be aligned even when unequal exchange and tension exists between buyers and suppliers. The paper also demonstrates that under some circumstances win-lose can be a preferable outcome than win-win for buyers and suppliers managing business relationships.","['buyer-seller relationships', 'sourcing', 'business-to-business marketingnan']",['sourcing'],supply chain management mutuality
"In a qualitative study of 19 family businesses, we examine the dynamics of successor teams, using insights from the family dynamics and succession literature and teams and conflict theory in family business.

"In this paper, we revisit the entrepreneurship and poverty relationship under a eudaimonic perspective that brings together conversion factors, and future prosperity expectations. Based on an fsQCA of changes in life circumstances of 166 farm households in rural Kenya, we explore how different combinations of conversion factors enable distinct forms of entrepreneuring in the pursuit of prosperity. Results show that strong entrepreneurship-enabled future prosperity expectations result from three combinations of enabling conversion factors shaping up three varieties of entrepreneurial endeavors: family-frugal, individual-market, and family-inwards, which show a much more diverse and counterintuitive reality. Our research contributes to literature by revealing and theorizing on a split picture portraying the many ways in which farmers, acting as everyday entrepreneurs, exploit real opportunities in seemingly identical impoverished communities. It also reveals a central disconnect between entrepreneurship, life-satisfaction and financial improvements when assessed against expectations of future prosperity. In doing so, this paper responds to calls for a better understanding of the processes whereby entrepreneurship can distinctively improve current and future life circumstances, and the many ways in which this may happen.","['Poverty alleviation, future prosperity, expectations, conversion factors, fsQCA', 'Human development', 'Farming entrepreneurship', 'Resource-constrained contexts', 'KenyaCONTEXT', 'FAMILY', 'FUTURE', 'COMPLEXITY', 'INNOVATION', 'FRAMEWORK', 'HAPPINESS', 'BUSINESS', 'BASE', 'HOPE']","['family', 'future', 'base']",entrepreneurship poverty conversion
"Despite the increasing importance of financial and social remittances to developing countries, their impact on home-country venture-investing environments has been largely overlooked. I develop a framework grounded in transaction costs economics and social knowledge theories to investigate relationships between remittances and home-country (1) capital availability, (2) new business creation, and (3) economic internationalization. My framework also accounts for individual and collective immigrant attributes that may moderate the impact of remittances on these alternative indicators of the venture investment environment. Analyses of immigrant remittances to 61 developing countries from 2002-2007 indicate that they increase general and more narrowly defined venture capital availability as well as broader openness to international trade. Remittances also increase new business start-up rates when the developing country's public sector is sufficiently small. Positive venture-funding effects of remittances are magnified when coming from immigrants living in highly concentrated communities, but are diminished when coming from highly educated immigrants. Overall, results suggest that developing-country immigrants of varying backgrounds play an important role in venture funding, founding and integration with the world economy.

"The authors offer their personal interpretations as participant-observers together with a data-based analysis of the evolution of the services marketing literature. Bibliographic analysis of more than 1000 English-language, general services marketing publications spanning four decades provides the empirical base for the paper. Using an evolutionary metaphor as the framework, the authors trace the literature through three stages: Crawling Out (1953-79); Scurrying About (1980-85); and Walking Erect (1986-present). The discussion of the three stages shows how the literature has evolved from the early services-marketing-is-different debate to the maturation of specific topics (e.g., service quality, service encounters) and the legitimization of the services marketing literature by major marketing journals. A classification and summary of the publishing outlets where the literature has appeared is presented.

"We examine how leadership transition affects firm performance in emerging economies. Building upon the social embeddedness and neo-institutional perspectives, we argue for the importance of alignment between successor origin and social context for firm performance. We suggest that as a baseline outside successors enhance firm profitability because of the large-scale and rapid changes in emerging markets. However, this outsider premium is reduced in firms embedded in family and business group relationships, where family and inside successors can better access network resources. But the outsider premium is amplified in firms embedded in a mature market-based logic, such as high tech or foreign invested firms, because the perceived legitimacy of outsiders facilitates resource acquisition. Our arguments are supported through the analysis of Taiwanese listed firms between 1996 and 2005.

"Purpose - This paper seeks to present a comprehensive overview of the supply chain as an autopoietic system. The new autopoietic approach suggests a transition from traditional cognitivist epistemology to the theory of learning as a creational matter, and this type of thinking can potentially shed light on the role of knowledge creation as a part of supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is structured as follows: the first section describes the theoretical background of the concept of knowledge management in the supply chain. After that, the paper examines the general systems theory and the role of an autopoietic system within it. Then the paper addresses autopoietic epistemology. In particular, the notions of knowledge, learning, and knowledge flows are described so that the focus is on the context of the supply chain and supply chain management at operational level. Findings - The supplier's, customer's, and-firm's own organization and parts of the organization have autonomy-system memories, which ultimately formulate how the intended development ideas are in fact realized and how they are adopted by the organization. Supply chain managers should take into account the fact that the routines and norms of the node are part of the system that are not controlled from outside. Instead, the system can modify its objectives internally as part of its autonomous operation, which should be taken into consideration in the knowledge sharing process. Originality/value - The description of a supply chain as an autopoietic knowledge system is a new way to examine knowledge sharing in a supply chain.","['Supply chain', 'Knowledge creation', 'Autopoietic epistemology', 'Autopoietic system', 'System thinkingPROJECT-BASED COMPANIES', 'SOCIAL-SYSTEMS']","['supply chain', 'supply chain', 'knowledge creation', 'knowledge creation', 'autopoietic epistemology', 'autopoietic epistemology', 'autopoietic system', 'autopoietic system']",supply chain management
"This paper combines organizational ecology and neoinstitutional theory to explain the process of diversification, specifically, how the structure of markets affects rates of market entry. I extend the density-dependence model of competition and legitimation, which has been used to study organizational founding and failure, to the process of organizational change through entry into new markets. I argue that the number of organizations operating in a particular market will have an inverted-U-shaped relationship with the rate of entry into that market. I also examine propositions, drawn from neoinstitutional theory, that organizations will follow similar and successful organizations into new markets. I assess the link between entry into new markets and (1) the number of organizations operating in those markets similar to a potential entrant and (2) the number of successful organizations in those markets. I also explore whether these two mimetic processes act in concert by examining whether successful potential entrants to a market are influenced by the presence of other successful organizations. I test these hypotheses on a population of savings and loan associations. I find that these firms imitate large and profitable organizations, but I find only limited evidence of imitation of similarly sized organizations, as large organizations copy the actions of other large organizations.","['nanDENSITY DEPENDENCE', 'BREWING INDUSTRY', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'EVOLUTION', 'DYNAMICS', 'MODEL']","['organizations', 'model']",entry
"Place attachment is one's strong emotional bond with a specific location. While there are numerous studies on the topic, the literature pays little attention to commercial settings. This is because they are seen as too insipid to rouse attachment. Consumer research, however, suggests otherwise. To address this disparity, the authors investigate how people develop, experience, and act on place attachment in commercial settings. Findings from consumer in-depth interviews and self-reports conducted in France reveal that place attachment develops through perceptions of familiarity, authenticity, and security and evolves into experiences of homeyness. Consumers find these encounters of homeyness extraordinary and respond by engaging in volunteering, over-reciprocation, and ambassadorship toward the place. The authors further theorize these findings through a gift economy perspective and identify a tripartite exchange between the consumer, the proprietor of the place, and selected people from the consumer's social network.","['nanSOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGY', 'CONSUMPTION', 'MARKET', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'EXPERIENCE', 'COMMUNITY', 'SENSE', 'RISK']","['perceptions', 'experience']",place attachment place homeyness volunteering gift economy
"We examine the consequences of alliance portfolio configuration by focusing on contingencies that affect the impact of alliance portfolio size on innovation and financial performance. While increasing alliance portfolio size is expected to positively impact innovation and financial performance, we propose that, at high levels of innovation of the focal firm, increasing alliance portfolio size dampens financial performance. We also propose that firm boundaries moderate the impact of alliance portfolio size on innovation and financial performance differently. Specifically, vertically integrated firms benefit less (more) than their vertically specialized counterparts in leveraging higher innovation (financial) performance with increasing alliance portfolio size. Our analysis suggests that both vertical scope and innovation levels of the firm play an important role in understanding how alliance portfolios impact performance.

"Organizational decline prompts leaders to downsize, reducing the size of the workforce in an attempt to cut costs. This paper discusses some of the dangers of downsizing in which organizations experience an unanticipated and unwanted loss of core competencies. An alternative to downsizing is offered, showing how organizations can 'de-develop' by slowly and deliberately moving to a lower order of organized complexity, retaining essential core competencies and supporting functions. To produce a 'soft-landing' that preserves core competencies, a new identity is forged and connections to the new identity are uncovered. The connections point out what must be preserved, such as a crucial channel for key products, for the new identity to survive and flourish. The de-developed organization preserves customers, products, markets, channels, revenue sources, alliances, skilled people, ways to organize, and/or image crucial to the new strategic identity before letting go of the remaining customers, products, etc. The paper identifies conditions under which de-development can be desirable and suggests a 'devolutionary' process that points out some of the key moves needed to reduce organized complexity and realize a soft landing.","['nanMANAGEMENT', 'DECLINE', 'FRAMEWORK', 'SURVIVAL', 'VISION']",['decline'],soft landing
"We examine how legal creditor rights are related to debt financing and corporate investment over the business cycle. Using firm-level data from 40 countries, we find that creditor rights are associated with greater debt financing and investment during economic downturns, but creditor rights have a significantly smaller effect during expansions. The beneficial effects of creditor rights during recessions are stronger for firms that are more likely to have severe shareholder-bondholder agency problems. We also find that during recessions (relative to expansions) strong creditor rights are associated with a smaller decline in net capital flows. Our findings are consistent with credit market frictions increasing during recessions, and with stronger creditor rights decreasing the negative effects of these frictions. Overall, the results suggest that better creditor protection laws help moderate the decline in debt financing and investment during recessions.","['business cycles', 'creditor rights', 'agency costs', 'debt financing', 'investmentAGENCY COSTS', 'NET WORTH', 'DETERMINANTS', 'BANKRUPTCY', 'FIRM', 'OPPORTUNITIES', 'INSTITUTIONS', 'CONTRACTS', 'RIGHTS']","['creditor rights', 'creditor rights', 'debt financing', 'debt financing', 'firm', 'rights']",creditor rights expansions
"There is no worse time to be interrupted than right now. Being close to attaining a goal to complete a focal task increases the attractiveness of that task compared to an interrupting task (study 1), makes people less willing to take on some otherwise attractive interruption than if they were farther away from completion (studies 2, 3, and 4), and causes them to perceive that in that moment they have little spare time (studies 3 and 4). Consumers immersed in goal pursuit are affected by local progress on an individual subgoal that supports an overarching goal even if this has no effect on the timing of attaining the overarching goal. Observers do not appreciate the motivating power of proximity to completing subgoals, and this leads them to mispredict the behavior of others (study 5).","['nanGRADIENT HYPOTHESIS', 'PROGRESS', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'EXPERIENCES', 'PERCEPTION', 'PROMOTIONS', 'PURSUIT', 'IMPACT']","['progress', 'pursuit']",time pursuit behavior 5

The latter are sub-grouped into six categories of regression, ANOVA/MANOVA, structural equation modeling (SEM), analytical modeling, qualitative analysis, and other. Patterns of the usage of these approaches and techniques are tracked over the years and across content areas.

Through triangulating theories from the diverse fields of information systems research, uses and gratification research, and domestication research, the authors put forth an integrated model that explains intention to use mobile services. The model proposes four overall influences on usage intention: motivational influences, attitudinal influences, normative pressure, and perceived control. The authors study the type of interactivity and process characteristics associated with the service that moderate the effects on the relationship between the proposed antecedents and usage intention. The results from empirical studies of four mobile services show strong support for the effects of motivational influences, attitudinal influences, normative pressure, and perceived control on consumers' intentions to use mobile services. Some of the effects are moderated by process characteristics (goal-directed vs. experiential services) that are associated with the service.","['mobile services', 'technology acceptance', 'adoption', 'structural equation modelingTECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL', 'INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY', 'INTRINSIC MOTIVATION', 'PERCEIVED USEFULNESS', 'CAUSAL RELATIONS', 'SELF-SERVICE', 'COMMERCE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'USAGE', 'EASE']","['mobile services', 'mobile services', 'usage']",mobile services gratification

This is becoming problematic as the global marketplace develops. The authors argue that to meet the theoretical and methodological challenges of global branding, international marketing scholars will need to revise some key premises and foundations. Branding research in the future will need to be contextually and historically grounded, polycentric in orientation, and acutely attuned to the symbolic significance of brands of all types.

"Traditionally, firms in the pharmaceutical industry have depended on their internal research and development (R&D) capabilities to maintain a productive new product pipeline. During the past two decades, however, the industry's pipeline productivity has decreased compromising the industry's ability to meet shareholder expectations. As a strategy to invigorate pipeline productivity, and impact financial performance, pharmaceutical firms have increased utilization of strategic technical alliances. Earlier research shows that the degree of financial impact resulting from strategic technical alliances varies in terms of partnership type and differences between client and partner firms. This research studies strategic technical alliances between pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms from 1985 to 2012. Event study methodology is used to determine the relationship between stock market response to alliance announcements, measured as cumulative abnormal returns, and factors representing the absorptive capacity of the pharmaceutical firms in the sample. Then, variables indicating the development stage of the drugs included in the alliances are added to assess the effect of project risk on the market response. The study finds that, in general, the stock market responds in a positive manner to strategic technical alliances in the pharmaceutical industry reflecting the market's immediate response, and expectations of future firm value, resulting from the alliance. The degree of the market's response varies in terms of the client firms' absorptive capacity with new product introductions being the strongest driver. The market responds similarly to alliances across different drug development stages, however, a stronger response is observed in preclinical and extension stages.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'PHARMACEUTICAL ALLIANCES', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'CREATE VALUE', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'INNOVATION', 'INDUSTRY', 'ACQUISITION']","['absorptive capacity', 'absorptive capacity', 'technology', 'industry']",alliances
"Using the impact of the Soviet Union's collapse on the performance of theoretical mathematicians as a natural experiment, we attempt to resolve the controversy in prior research on whether specialists or generalists have superior creative performance. While many have highlighted generalists' advantage due to access to a wider set of knowledge components, others have underlined the benefits that specialists can derive from their deep expertise. We argue that this disagreement might be partly driven by the fact that the pace of change in a knowledge domain shapes the relative return from being a specialist or a generalist. We show that generalist scientists performed best when the pace of change was slower and their ability to draw from diverse knowledge domains was an advantage in the field, but specialists gained advantage when the pace of change increased and their deeper expertise allowed them to use new knowledge created at the knowledge frontier. We discuss and test the roles of cognitive mechanisms and of competition for scarce resources. Specifically, we show that specialists became more desirable collaborators when the pace of change was faster, but when the pace of change was slower, generalists were more sought after as collaborators. Overall, our results highlight trade-offs associated with specialization for creative performance.","['knowledge specialization and creativity', 'change and creativity', 'knowledge frontier', 'Soviet collapse and productivity of mathematiciansSOCIAL NETWORKS', 'INNOVATION', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'INVENTORS', 'COLLABORATION', 'BREAKTHROUGHS', 'INSTITUTIONS', 'EXPERIENCE', 'DISCOVERY']","['knowledge frontier', 'knowledge frontier']",
"Research Summary: Non-profit organizations in emerging markets frequently have to manage relations with governments and for-profit firms. We advance a multistakeholder perspective and develop propositions about how the political ties of charities influence their success in raising funds from corporate donors. Evidence from 2,054 Chinese charities during 2005-2012 shows that organizational political ties, established through formal affiliation with the government, aid fundraising from corporate donors, whereas personal political ties, formed through personal political services of senior leaders of charities, have no such effect. The positive effect of government affiliation is relevant for both foreign and domestic donors, but stronger for domestic ones. These results highlight the differential impact and contingent value of political embeddedness for charities' ability to acquire resources from for-profit business, contributing to both stakeholder theory and the political embeddedness perspective. Managerial Summary: Non-profit organizations have to maintain productive relations with multiple stakeholders, including government and business. We focus on Chinese charities that seek to raise funds to fulfill their mission. We identify how their political relations influence the behavior of corporate donors. Evidence from 2,054 charities from 2005 to 2012 shows that political ties formed through organizational affiliation with a political body help charities attract corporate donors that seek legitimacy. In contrast, ties formed through personal connections with politicians have less influence on donors who perceive a high risk of connected insiders engaging in activities of dubious legality. The value of political ties is more pronounced for domestic corporate donors.","['charities', 'corporate donations', 'emerging markets', 'political ties', 'stakeholdersEMERGING ECONOMIES EVIDENCE', 'POLITICAL EMBEDDEDNESS', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY', 'SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'STAKEHOLDER THEORY', 'MANAGERIAL TIES', 'CONNECTIONS', 'TRANSITION', 'DIRECTORS']","['charities', 'emerging markets', 'emerging markets', 'political ties', 'political ties', 'political embeddedness', 'political embeddedness', 'stakeholder theory', 'stakeholder theory', 'connections']",political ties political embeddedness stakeholder theory
"Accurate sales projections are of vital importance to the profitability and long-term survival of high-tech companies. This is especially true in the growth stage of product innovation, because major investments and marketing decisions are made in this phase. By examining recent empirical studies focusing on consumer behavior in high-technology markets, several factors are identified that can affect individual buying decisions and aggregate sales, namely, interpersonal communication, democratization of innovation, direct and indirect network effects, forward-looking behavior, and consumer heterogeneity. Against this background the diffusion-modeling and the utility-based approach are reviewed in terms of their basic conception and their applicability to the markets concerned. Based on this investigation a sales forecasting model for high-tech products, specifically in the growth stage, is developed. The model has a utility-theoretic background and a logistic structure. Since data are scarce in this early stage of the product life cycle two versions of the new approach are discussed, an extended version considering forward-looking behavior and a more parsimonious (myopic'') one. The performance of the new model is demonstrated using real sales data on the CD player, the DVD player/recorder, and the digital camera market. The empirical comparisons include alternative specifications of the Bass diffusion model as well as a proportional hazard model and consist of two steps. First, the models are checked as to whether they are able to represent the sales data at all. It is shown that both versions of the proposed model are at least equivalent, if not superior, to the models used as benchmarks in terms of fit. In the next step, the models are applied to predict future sales in the three markets. The resulting forecasts show that the proposed model performs significantly better than its benchmarks. Its parsimony enables reliable predictions, even in cases, where only short time series are available for parameter estimation. The model is able to anticipate decreasing diffusion rates as they occur at the end of the growth stage and, thus, helps to avoid overoptimistic sales forecasts, which may cause severe economic damages. The new approach is easy to calibrate and can be applied without specialized econometric expertise.","['nanPRODUCT DIFFUSION-MODELS', 'NETWORK EXTERNALITIES', 'CONSUMER DURABLES', 'GROWTH', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'ADOPTION', 'COMPETITION']",['growth'],product innovation
"Interactivity is a key feature of Web sites. This article identifies the determinants that enhance user perceptions of interactivity in a communication scenario in which consumers send instant messages to an e-store. Two conceptualizations of interactivity-telepresence theory and interactivity theory-predict that different antecedents (e.g., the number of clicks, response time, message type) are important. The results of Experiment 1 indicate that message type (i.e., how personal a particular message is) is the strongest predictor of interactivity perceptions. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the effects of message type on perceived interactivity and Web site effectiveness are greater when consumers are complaining than when they are inquiring about services. The results of Experiment 2 show that as the level of message personalization increases, interactivity perceptions and site effectiveness are enhanced (linear relationship). The authors discuss the implications of the findings for theory and practice and provide directions for measuring and manipulating interactivity in further research.","['interactivity', 'perceived interactivity', 'telepresence theory', 'Internet shopping', 'Web site designINTERNET', 'COMMUNICATION', 'PERCEPTION', 'FRAMEWORK', 'QUALITY', 'MODEL', 'TIME']","['interactivity', 'perceived interactivity', 'perceived interactivity', 'telepresence theory', 'telepresence theory', 'communication', 'perception', 'time']",interactivity telepresence theory antecedents
"This study attempts to increase the understanding of how offshoring influences the introduction of new products and services. Focusing on the offshoring of those business functions that provide direct knowledge inputs for innovation (i.e., production, R&D, and engineering), we propose that offshoring has an inverted U-shaped influence on firm innovativeness. Additionally, we provide an upper echelon contingency perspective by considering the moderating role of two top management team (TMT) attributes (i.e., informational diversity and shared vision). Using a cross-industry sample with lagged data, we find that offshoring has an inverted U-shaped influence on firm innovativeness and that this relationship is steeper in firms with high TMT informational diversity and in firms with low TMT shared vision.

"We investigate the conditions under which messages that prompt low and high levels of fear are likely to be effective. Our premise is that when a low level of fear is ineffective, it is because there is insufficient elaboration of the harmful consequences of engaging in the destructive behavior. By contrast, when appeals arousing high levels of fear are ineffective, it is because too much elaboration on the harmful consequences interferes with processing of the recommended change in behavior. We find support for these expectations in the context of a communication advocating that people stop smoking. The elaboration-enhancing interventions used, self-reference and imagery processing, increased the persuasiveness of a low-fear appeal by prompting elaboration on the harmful consequences of smoking, whereas the use of two elaboration-suppressing interventions, reference to others and objective processing, increased the persuasiveness of a high-fear appeal by decreasing the extent to which consumers deny harmful consequences.","['nanSELF-REFERENCE', 'INFORMATION', 'IMAGERY']",['imagery'],self reference

"Why might firms be regarded as astutely managed at one point, yet subsequently lose their positions of industry leadership when faced with technological change? We present a model, grounded in a study of the world disk drive industry, that charts the process through which the demands of a firm's customers shape the allocation of resources in technological innovation-a model that links theories of resource dependence and resource allocation. We show that established firms led the industry in developing technologies of every sort-even radical ones-whenever the technologies addressed existing customers' needs. The same firms failed to develop simpler technologies that initially were only useful in emerging markets, because impetus coalesces behind, and resources are allocated to, programs targeting powerful customers. Projects targeted at technologies for which no customers yet exist languish for lack of impetus and resources. Because the rate of technical progress can exceed the performance demanded in a market, technologies which initially can only be used in emerging markets later can invade mainstream ones, carrying entrant firms to victory over established companies.","['innovation', 'resource allocation', 'strategy change', 'technological change', 'failureESTABLISHED FIRMS']","['innovation', 'resource allocation', 'resource allocation', 'technological change', 'technological change']",industry

"The competitive nature of knowledge transfer and the process of organizational learning between partners constitute a fundamental challenge for both academics and practitioners alike. By focusing on one type of competency - marketing know-how - this research examines the role of knowledge ambiguity pertaining to the process of knowledge transfer in international strategic alliances. Based on a cross-sectional sample of 151 multinationals and a structural equation methodology, this study empirically investigates the antecedents of knowledge ambiguity: tacitness, asset specificity, complexity, experience, partner protectiveness, cultural distance, and organizational distance. Further, the strength of the relationships between these theoretical constructs and ambiguity is examined in light of the possible moderating effects of collaborative experience, firm size, and the duration of the alliance entered. Consistently, tacitness emerges as the most significant determinant of knowledge transferability Moreover, the effects of cultural distance, asset specificity, and prior experience are moderated respectively by the firm's level of collaborative experience, the duration of the alliance, and the firm's size.","['nanJOINT-VENTURES', 'UNITED-STATES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FIRM', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'COMPETENCE', 'JAPANESE', 'CAPABILITIES', 'COOPERATION', 'COMPETITION']",['firm'],knowledge transfer knowledge strategic alliances
"There is a growing belief among some that employee empowerment provides the most appropriate basis for designing and implementing new organizations. However, from a structural perspective, empowerment represents a moral hazard dilemma for managers; with the possibility of: control loss and decreased organizational outcome. While there are several mechanisms for tempering the potential downside of empowerment, we focus on two: organizational constitutions and the development of trusting relationships. We present six specific propositions relating to organizational constitution and trust as controls for tempering the potential downside of empowerment.","['nanMODEL', 'OWNERSHIP', 'POWER', 'COSTS']",['power'],trusting

To this end, the paper mobilizes the work of Boltanski and Thevenot on orders of worth to analyse the consequences for a professional body of a shift in institutional logics towards more accountability. The feeling of injustice experienced - and voiced - by some members of the largest British institute of auditors, the ICAEW, after it set up and operated a quality monitoring unit, serves to illustrate how change can turn awry when equity in a community of peers is threatened, and how institutional work can remedy such a situation by restoring a sense of worth in the community.","['audit profession', 'Boltanski', 'institutional work', 'quality control', 'Thevenot', 'United KingdomINSTITUTIONAL CHANGE', 'CHANGING NATURE', 'LOGICS', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'ACCOUNTANCY', 'FIELDS', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'BODIES', 'RISK']","['boltanski', 'institutional work', 'institutional work', 'thevenot', 'logics']",institutional work monitoring
"This study investigates relationships between experience and education aspects of manager qualifications and performance measures in a sample of 103 Portfolio Companies (PC) of German Venture Capital Firms (VCF). In addition, we consider whether lower PC performance induces higher PC manager turnover and if VCF actively influences such PC manager turnover. Bivariate and multivariate analyses confirmed that PC manager qualifications correlate significantly with PC performance. Specifically, characteristics of PC manager experience in marketing/sales, planning/strategy functional areas, as well as in terms of industry experience, were identified as critical success factors. Our findings have substantial implications for VCF management practice: Although deficits in PC manager qualifications were addressed previously both in English and the German language academic literature, to date management practices did not recognize the relevance of such such qualifications for investment success and the need to ir influence PC manager qualifications systematically through tailored selection and development procedures for PC managers. Had the need to compensate for gaps in PC manager qualifications been given adequate priority, our sample would neither contain a high variance for qualification variables nor significant correlations between multiple aspects of PC manager qualifications and success. Therefore, our findings suggest that (German) VCF should in due diligence put more emphasis on (1) PC managers' business functional experience and, useless the PC is active in an entirely new market, (2) a high proportion of managers with experience in the relevant industry. Beyond due diligence VCF may have to actively realign or replace top managers of PCs in cases where success is substantially below expectations. It is highly likely that there is roam for pur ther improvement in this area in particular in constructing incentives against living dead cases, where PCs develop substantially below expectations, but do not fail completely.

The authors propose an incongruity hypothesis, suggesting that source certainty effects depend on perceived source expertise. In three experiments, consumers receive persuasive messages from sources of varying expertise and certainty. Across studies, low expertise sources violate expectancies, stimulate involvement, and promote persuasion when they express certainty, whereas high expertise sources violate expectancies, stimulate involvement, and promote persuasion when they express uncertainty. Thus, nonexpert (expert) sources can gain interest and influence by expressing certainty (uncertainty).","['nanSOURCE CREDIBILITY', 'ATTITUDE CERTAINTY', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'CONFIDENCE', 'DETERMINANT', 'INFORMATION', 'TRUSTWORTHINESS', 'ASSIMILATION', 'ATTRIBUTIONS', 'EXPERTISE']",['expertise'],incongruity expertise expertise involvement
"Existing research has shown that positive family experiences can affect work positively. In this article, however, we consider how family may enhance work even when family experiences are not explicitly positive. We draw on boundary theory and cognitive psychology's current concerns theory to evaluate how employees' family structures and associated after-work activities affect their work absorption. A survey of business school alumni (Study 1) revealed that single, childless workers reported lower absorption than workers with other family structures. Further, a daily diary study of university employees (Study 2) showed that employees' planned after-work activities explained the relationship between family structure and work absorption. Specifically, single, childless workers anticipated fewer domestic after-work activities, resulting in lower work absorption. Due to similarities between domestic responsibilities and work tasks-for example, their obligatory and goal-directed nature-anticipating domestic responsibilities after work reinforces, rather than distracts from, the work mindset, thus keeping employees more immersed psychologically in their work. This finding suggests that having a spouse and/or children can affect employees' work absorption positively through the anticipation of domestic duties after work. Thus, our study contributes to a more comprehensive view of how employees' work and nonwork lives are connected.","['nanOFF-JOB ACTIVITIES', 'DUAL-EARNER COUPLES', 'MULTILEVEL SEM', 'GENDER-DIFFERENCES', 'LEISURE-TIME', 'RECOVERY', 'ENGAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EXPERIENCE', 'CONFLICT']",['experience'],work absorption
"To fully understand influence as it relates to the workplace, scholars must continue to identify and measure constructs for classifying influence behavior. This study serves to promote Scholl's restrictive versus promotive control distinction and examine the relationships between such methods of influence and several work outcomes (i.e., leader-member exchange theory, commitment, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions). Data were obtained from state government employees (N = 105) located in the southeastern United States, and all hypotheses were assessed via hierarchical moderated multiple regression. Although restrictive and promotive control were related to each of the work outcomes, several relationships were moderated by employee locus of control.

"As organizational buying systems grow more complex and sophisticated, suppliers increasingly rely on buyer advocacy: an individual buyer's efforts to influence his/her colleagues such that the supplier's standing is improved. Drawing from cognitive response theory, the authors hypothesize an inverted U-shaped relationship between a buyer's advocacy for a supplier and the customer's purchases from that supplier. They theorize that this effect is moderated by the advocate's industry experience and customer-supplier relationship characteristics. An analysis of multisource data from a B2B service provider (Study 1) supports the predicted inverted U-shaped relationship, while a unique dataset from a large industrial supplier (Study 2) provides broad support for the hypothesized moderators. Finally, a randomized experiment (Study 3) replicates key findings and corroborates the theorized cognitive response mechanisms. Findings contribute to the limited literature on buyer advocacy within the organizational buying domain and offer practical implications for suppliers and buyers.","['Buyer advocacy', 'Organizational buying', 'Cognitive response theory', 'Relationship marketingSOURCE CREDIBILITY', 'INFLUENCE STRATEGIES', 'CUSTOMER', 'SALESPERSON', 'RESISTANCE', 'MODEL', 'SPECIFICATION', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE']","['buyer advocacy', 'buyer advocacy', 'organizational buying', 'organizational buying', 'cognitive response theory', 'cognitive response theory', 'cognitive response theory', 'customer']",systems buyer advocacy cognitive response theory
"This research investigates the influence of retail chain-level activities (e.g., district supervisor directives and policies) and store manager behaviors on the sale of physical products versus services. Using data gathered within a U.S.-based retail automotive parts chain, the authors discover that to sell services, especially in competitive environments, store managers should focus on sales planning and transformative leadership behaviors, which accentuate both the long-term planning horizon and the effects of managerial actions. In less competitive environments though, a more transactional approach (e.g., selling orientation) can be effective for selling services. Alternatively, to sell products, store managers' selling effort appears to be the most important driver of success, and a transformative leadership approach may be detrimental when the retailer faces a high level of direct competition. In total, the findings suggest that corporate chain activities, such as the level and clarity of store managers' goals and supervisor monitoring, influence store manager behaviors, which in turn affect the sale of physical products and services.

"We analyze how communications networks and social institutions influenced the growth of the antislavery movement in the U. S. from 1790 to 1840. Communications networks fueled by print media transmitted news about the movement to the public and so helped mobilize a broad base of support. Among social institutions, churches were especially supportive because their emphasis on morality and community was conducive to antislavery activism. Our analysis focuses on the founding of antislavery societies, the formal organizations that underpinned this movement, and makes three contributions to our understanding of social movement organizations in general and antislavery societies in particular. First, we show that the impact of mass media was strong as far back as the early nineteenth century and that the growth of magazines spurred antislavery society formation. Second, we demonstrate that theology, specifically an orientation toward this world or heaven, determined whether religious resources were available to antislavery organizations. This-worldly religions supported abolition organizing, while other-worldly religions undermined it. Third, we resolve an important causal ambiguity in debates about antislavery by showing that the development of the media was the cause, not merely a consequence of or companion to growth of antislavery organizations.","['nanINSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES', 'SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS', 'MEDIA', 'DIFFUSION', 'CULTURE', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'EVOLUTION', 'NETWORKS', 'VIOLENCE', 'ORIGINS']","['media', 'organizations', 'networks']",

Results suggest that outside directors, large institutional investors, and accountants limit such concealment, but small institutional investors and outside directors who are shareholders prompt it. Low disclosure is associated with subsequent selling of stock by top officers and outside directors. This result supports the claim that concealment by officers and its toleration by outside directors may be intentional.","['nanCORPORATE-CONTROL', 'TOP-MANAGEMENT', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'MANAGERIAL CONTROL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'MARKET', 'ATTRIBUTIONS', 'DIRECTORS', 'DECISIONS']",['directors'],directors disclosure
"Using representative samples of U.S. and Japanese retail service firms, this study explores whether one particular type of organizational culture is the best with respect to business outcomes (performance and customer satisfaction) or whether the optimum culture depends on the national context in which the firm is embedded. The findings suggest that there is a significant interaction effect of organizational culture with national culture on outcomes. Specifically, the relationships between the importance placed on the cultural values of stability, people orientation, and detail orientation and outcomes are significantly greater for Japanese than for U.S. service retailers. On the other hand, the relationships between the values of aggressiveness, innovation, and outcome orientation and outcomes are greater for U.S. retailers. Further, the findings show that firms whose cultures match those of their home countries exhibit lower levels of outcomes when they operate in other countries with different cultural values. Implications are given for how service retailers might be designed and managed for purposes of improving business outcomes.","['National culture', 'Organizational culture', 'Business performance', 'Customer satisfactionUNITED-STATES', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'CORPORATE CULTURE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'VALUES', 'INNOVATIVENESS', 'EQUIVALENCE', 'RESPONSES']","['national culture', 'national culture', 'organizational culture', 'organizational culture', 'customer satisfaction', 'customer satisfaction', 'performance', 'values']",japanese culture satisfaction values orientation values innovation
"We examined the consequences of regulatory focus on exposure to two types of comparative advertising frames-a maximal claim (brand A is superior to brand B) and a minimal claim(brand A is equivalent or similar to brand B)-in three experiments. In experiment 1, we manipulated these frames, basing the sponsor brand's claim on comparison with an existing brand. In experiment 2, we operationalized the frames using a comparison featuring a sponsor brand targeting an established standard (Food and Drug Administration guidelines). A third experiment provided convergent evidence for the process underlying these effects. Consistent with theoretical reasoning, we found that promotion-focused individuals were more persuaded by maximal comparisons while prevention-focused individuals were either equally persuaded by the two frames or more persuaded by minimal frames. For prevention-focused individuals, maximal frames represented either a no loss or a deviation from the norm. The no loss representation led to maximal and minimal frames being equally persuasive. The deviation from the norm representation led to greater negative elaboration on maximal frames, making them less persuasive than minimal frames. For promotion-focused people, a maximal frame simply represented a gain over a minimal frame, and hence it induced more favorable elaboration and greater persuasion.","['nanCULTURAL VARIATIONS', 'PREVENTION', 'PROMOTION', 'PREFERENCE', 'DECISION']","['prevention', 'promotion']",advertising promotion prevention

Using data on 206 Chinese pharmaceutical firms over the period of 2000 to 2007, we found that firm financial performance (a proxy for firm resources) increased the likelihood of privatization. In addition to firm resources, we investigated how a heterogeneous body of decision makers within the governmental hierarchy influences the likelihood of firms' privatization. We found that provincial governmental owners' willingness to privatize firms increased when they had higher fiscal power. The results of this study also indicated a negative moderating influence of provincial fiscal power: Higher fiscal power of provincial governmental owners weakened the relationship between firm financial performance and the likelihood of privatization.","['privatization', 'China', 'state capitalism', 'governmental power', 'firm resourcesFOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STATE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'CAPABILITIES', 'MARKET', 'INSTITUTIONS', 'COMPETITION', 'DEPENDENCE']","['privatization', 'performance', 'state']",firms privatization state owned enterprises financial performance

"The type of activity in which entrepreneurs engage is likely to influence the potential contribution of entrepreneurship to economic growth and prosperity. Yet the entrepreneurship literature has focused largely on identifying the determinants of the level, rather than the type, of entrepreneurial activity. In this paper we hypothesize that a country's institutional environment will influence the allocation of entrepreneurial effort, and in particular will influence the extent to which entrepreneurial effort is directed toward high-growth activities. We test our hypotheses using data on 40 countries over the period 2002-2004. We find that the allocation of entrepreneurial effort toward high-growth activities is positively related to a country's financial and educational activities targeted at entrepreneurship, and is negatively related to a country's level of corruption. Our study is the first to provide empirical evidence that institutional characteristics significantly influence the allocation of entrepreneurial effort, and it is therefore the first to identify an empirically important channel through which a nation's institutions may contribute to economic growth.","['allocation', 'entrepreneurship', 'institutions', 'national business systemsECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT', 'INVESTOR PROTECTION', 'PROPERTY-RIGHTS', 'SELF-EMPLOYMENT', 'INNOVATION', 'GROWTH', 'FIRMS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'OWNERSHIP', 'COUNTRIES']","['allocation', 'entrepreneurship', 'institutions', 'growth', 'determinants', 'countries']",entrepreneurship determinants effort corruption

In 'relationship based strategy' entrepreneurial vision towards strengthening relationship is the basis for growth planning.

"This paper models the joint impact of two determinants of profitable resource advantages: the accuracy of managers' expectations about the future value of a resource, and the severity of agency problems that cause managers' interests to diverge from those of shareholders. While the impact of each of these factors on resource-investment decisions has been considered in isolation, their joint interaction effect has never been examined. The model generates the following set of testable hypotheses: Managers of firms with agency problems will, on average, tend to under-invest (relative to what shareholders would ideally like them to do) in resources of uncertain value. This under-investment will be most severe for those resources where managers' information indicates a low expected value (i.e., risky bets), and will actually be reversed (i.e., over-investment) for those resources where managers' information indicates a high expected value (i.e., safe bets). Two levers can be used to reduce the degree of this under-investment: reducing the severity of the agency problems, or improving the accuracy of managers' expectations. Based on their interaction effect, these two levers are shown to be complementary in the sense that they work better together at reducing under-investment than either one does in isolation. Therefore, future research on the genesis of competitive advantage should examine agency and governance issues along with, not apart from resource-based issues.

"This research was set in the People's Republic of China. As former socialist China moves from central planning toward a more market-driven economy, improved knowledge about the new environment and firm decisions within such an environment has significant implications. For organizational re searchers, such a transition represents a genuine shift of paradigm, and thus offers a unique opportunity to rest existing organizational theories and develop new ones. For multinational businesses seeking business opportunities, they have to compete or cooperate with these Chinese firms, whether state-owned or privately owned. Motivated by a deep curiosity in, using the language of Williamson (1996), ''What is going on there  behind the bamboo curtain,  and underpinned by a strong conviction that organizational researchers have much to gain as well as to offer by focusing on transitional economies, I undertook this study to examine characteristics of a regulatory environment and the impact on innovation and risk-taking among Chinese managers and entrepreneurs. I collected original primary data that represents managers from large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and entrepreneurs from small privately-owned enterprises (POEs) through personal interviews and a survey. Significant differences were found between managers and entrepreneurs in their reported environmental characteristics, strategic orientations, size, and firm performance, indicating that managers are not as innovative and are less willing to make risky decisions than entrepreneurs. Being smaller and faster than SOEs, entrepreneurial firms have adopted some strategies that distinguish them from their larger and more established competitors. Speed stealth, and sound execution allow entrepreneurs To harvest first-mover advantages and thus increase their chances for survival in a turbulent environment.

"Cloud computing has opened a new era in e-commerce. As the growth and complexity of public and private clouds increases, novel solutions are needed, enabling vendors to effectively manage the cloud-based distribution of their services. To this end, this paper presents a novel semantic framework with the main aim to support providers in the overall cloud-based service provision process, in terms of service ownership, licensing, and usage monitoring. The base of our framework is an ontological schema that models service business rules definition and license agreements registration, as well as service usage monitoring, with a special focus on web service and software applications cloud-based distribution. Our proposed ontology supports complex distribution schemas, related to multiple vendor-based service distribution, as well as personalized discount schemas, facilitating the deployment of marketing strategies during cloud-based service provision. On top of this ontological schema, we have further developed service and provider reputation and trust inference mechanisms, which operate on the basis of both service usage statistics and subjective end user feedback. Taking a step forward from the state of the art, our mechanisms also provide personalized discount suggestions, further facilitating providers in defining marketing strategies. Apart from supporting providers, our mechanisms also facilitate users in service and provider selection. In order to examine the application of our framework in practice, we have developed a user interface that provides basic features of our framework, within the context of a real cloud, oriented toward personalized cloud service provision; our framework has been integrated in the Cloud4All Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII).","['Cloud service provision', 'digital product management', 'global public inclusive infrastructure', 'property rights', 'reputation', 'semantic framework', 'trustELECTRONIC COMMERCE', 'ONTOLOGY', 'TRUST', 'SYSTEMS', 'SCIENCE']","['cloud service provision', 'cloud service provision', 'cloud service provision', 'global public inclusive infrastructure', 'global public inclusive infrastructure', 'global public inclusive infrastructure', 'global public inclusive infrastructure', 'reputation', 'semantic framework', 'semantic framework', 'ontology', 'trust']",cloud clouds semantic framework reputation trust
"This study focuses on the political and institutional influences that lead organizational decision makers to avoid terminating unsuccessful investments, even when there is competition and they have the experience and incentives to maximize profits. I examine multilevel influences on sequential investment decisions in the U. S. venture capital industry through a qualitative study of the investment process and a quantitative examination of venture capital investments between 1989 and 2004. Results show that venture capital firms become less likely to terminate investments as they participate in more rounds of financing, despite evidence that expected returns are declining over rounds. Intraorganizational politics, as well as coercive and normative pressures from co-investors and limited partners, may influence the decisions to continue or terminate investments, regardless of the expected returns. The findings suggest that organizational safeguards designed to mitigate individual biases may give rise to political and institutional influences, which may in turn undermine the effectiveness of the decision process.","['nanREAL OPTIONS', 'ESCALATING COMMITMENT', 'SUNK COSTS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PRACTICES', 'DE-ESCALATION', 'CHOSEN COURSE', 'MARKET', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INVESTMENT', 'NETWORKS']",['investment'],venture capital industry decision process

Through several examples we point to contributions that poststructuralist perspectives have brought to the field.

"Research summary: Many boards view their chairs as valuable resources. We predict that whether a board adopts such a view depends on the board chair's human and social capital. Data from S&P 500 firms suggest that while a board chair's human capital increases the probability that the board views him or her as a resource, social capital has no overall effect. In a post-hoc investigation, however, we find the board chair's independence to be an important boundary condition for the effect of social capital. With this exploratory research, we aim to spur research devoted specifically to board chairs. Such research will become increasingly important over time as firms continue to separate their CEO and board chair positions.Managerial summary: The purpose of this research was to determine the factors that lead a board of directors to view its chair as a valuable resource. We expected that board chairs with high human and social capital would be more likely to be viewed as a resource by their colleagues. Surprisingly, only human capital exhibited such an effect overall. Social capital increases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is independent, but actually decreases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is either the current or former CEO. These results suggest that boards generally value human capital in their chairs, but view social capital through a somewhat more complex lens. We explore the possible implications of these findings in the article.

"Purpose First, the paper aims to explore the ability of the actor sitting on the structural hole to achieve the additional rent, which is modeled as the outcome of joint effect between the relational performances of two dyads (supplier-buyer and buyer-customer) within the triadic supply chains. Second, the paper seeks to empirically compare the value of additional rent among different structural hole states of triadic supply chains. Design/methodology/approach Building upon the theoretical tenets of social capital theory, complemented by the underpinnings of relational view, this research uses survey data gathered from the triadic supply chains in Europe. To conduct necessary processing, the multivariate statistical analyses have been performed. Findings The findings suggest that the rent is actually yielded by the actors bridging the structural hole in the triadic supply chain; however, its value, as evidenced in the study, is diverse regarding the specific structural hole state. More specifically, the highest value of rent is generated by the buyer establishing cooperative posture of both dyads in the triadic supply chains. The value of rent close to zero is revealed in the triadic supply chains with negative relational posture of both dyads. Interestingly, the lowest level of rent produced by the buyer from bridging the structural hole is reported with the triadic supply chains in which one dyad demonstrates a more cooperative relational posture, whereas the other one indicates an adversarial relational posture. Not only does this result suggest that there is no rent, but it even goes further to indicate a negative return (or loss) derived by the manufacturer in this group of triadic supply chains. Research limitations/implications The study is limited to the relational posture, either strong or weak; therefore, it would be worthwhile to examine a wider spectrum of behaviors, based on the adversarial relationships, deprived of mutual trust, when both actors in a dyad act opportunistically and antagonistically. Moreover, regarding the research method used, the case study is usually deemed to be more appropriate to deeply grasp the complex issues of social behavior. Finally, caution should also be exercised while generalizing the results obtained from the research. Practical implications For practicing supply chain managers, this study points that that it is likely that both actors collaborating with the buyer (the supplier and the customer) also enjoy additional benefits offered by the rent. Importantly for managers, regardless of the effort made by the focal actor, the careless attitude and independence of suppliers and customers may make it hard or even impossible for the buyer to establish triads that include relationships of high quality. Social implications In terms of social implications, this study brings to the fore that not only are the buyers driven by self-interest but they may be also guided by ethical and social rules when interacting with suppliers and customers in their triads. This research evidenced that the buyer in the triadic supply chain can act as the moderator that tends to simultaneously establish a strong relational posture to two other actors in such a way that the joint effect of relational performance generated by both dyads significantly contributes to the higher level of buyer's individual performance. Originality/value The study investigates whether and how establishing relational posture of two dyads in the triadic supply chains can affect the additional rent for the buyer derived from bridging the structural hole.","['Customer relations', 'Customers', 'Supplier relationships', 'Supplier-manufacturer relationships', 'Rent', 'Triadic supply chain', 'Structural holeCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'INVENTORY MANAGEMENT', 'CLUSTER-ANALYSIS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INTEGRATION', 'NETWORKS', 'BUYER', 'CAPABILITIES', 'IMPACT', 'POWER']","['customers', 'rent', 'triadic supply chain', 'triadic supply chain', 'triadic supply chain', 'performance', 'buyer']",structural hole

"Purpose - To expand beyond existing research on the integration of supply chain and new product development that has a limited focused on the need to pre-inform supply chain before product launch, the need for new product development to consider the impact of product design on supply chain operations and research has focused on ensuring product availability at the product launch. Design/methodology/approach - This research note suggests avenues forward and areas for practice and research to progress. Findings - The existing and limited focus on involving supply chain in new product development overlooks several central issues and opportunities that companies are beginning to explore and that can be supported by research. In particular the opportunity to focus on leveraging supply chain in new product development, for greater market impact and revenue growth. Practical implications - Addressing the path forward, beyond limited approaches requires greater alignment between new product development and supply chain, it requires a focus that goes beyond just ensuring product availability and it requires alignment much further upstream in the new product development process. Examples of early progress in companies are provided. Originality/value - In addition to summarizing existing research, new avenues for research and practice are offered that can tremendously improve alignment and the contribution of supply chain on new product development, for the good of the company as a whole. Specific research areas are suggest to enable research to support the realization of the path forward in this area.","['product development', 'supply chain managementDESIGN', 'DECISIONS']","['product development', 'product development']",design
"This research examines when and how ambient scents (i.e., scents that are present in the environment and do not emanate from a specific product) affect product evaluations. Consistent with theory in environmental psychology, the author predicts that such ambient scents can elicit emotional responses that can influence subsequent judgments, but only when specific conditions are met. Three factors are hypothesized to moderate the effects of pleasant ambient scents on evaluations: (1) the congruence of the scent with the product, (2) the salience of the scent, and (3) consumers' motivation to correct for extraneous influences. The findings of three experiments suggest that as long as ambient scents are congruent with the product, they continue to affect consumers' evaluations, even when their influence becomes salient or when consumers are sufficiently motivated to correct for extraneous influences. In addition, as long as the scent is not completely incongruent with the product, noncongruent scents are corrected for only when their influence becomes salient or when consumers are sufficiently motivated. These findings indicate that the impact of pleasant ambient scents on product evaluations may be stronger than that of other affective environmental cues.","['nanPLEASANT FRAGRANCES', 'TASK-PERFORMANCE', 'POSITIVE AFFECT', 'ODORS', 'IMPACT', 'ASSIMILATION', 'PERSUASION', 'CONTRAST', 'REALITY', 'MEMORY']",['impact'],cues
"Much of the literature on corporate acquisitions has focused on managerial incentives for making acquisitions but has underemphasized the role played by the social context Of major shareholders. This study of Fortune 1000 firms argues that the priorities and risk preferences of family owners can have important implications not only for the volume but also,for the diversifying nature of their acquisitions. Agency and family business perspectives are used to derive expectations concerning the acquisitions behavior of family owners. Consistent with both perspectives, and owners' desire to reduce business risk, we find that family ownership is inversely related to the number and dollar volume of acquisitions. However, whereas agency theorists differ about how ownership concentration influences whether acquisitions are diversified, the family firm literature is more definitive. The latter suggests that given family owners' desire to retain control of their firms for offspring, their wealth must remain concentrated. Hence they can most easily reduce the risk of their wealth portfolio by, diversifying the business-that is, through diversifying acquisitions. Consistent with this logic, we found the propensity to make diversifying acquisitions to increase with the level of family ownership.

"Values are an essential element explaining a person's attitudes and behavior. Therefore, it is surprising that despite the number of studies that have examined the organizational and managerial factors affecting export performance, little research has investigated the possible impact of a manager's individual values on strategic choice and the export performance of the firm. To address this gap in the literature, the authors examine the impact of managers' values on the firm's customer responsiveness and export performance. In addition, they examine the mediating role of customer responsiveness in the values export performance linkage. The authors explore the empirical usefulness of the psychic distance construct by examining its direct link with export performance and the extent to which it moderates the relationship between individual values and export performance. Overall, the results suggest that managers' values significantly influence strategic decisions and the export performance of the firm, highlighting the need for more research attention in this area.","['individual values', 'export performance', 'customer responsiveness', 'psychic distanceSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT', 'PSYCHIC DISTANCE', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK', 'CULTURAL DISTANCE', 'HUMAN-RESOURCES', 'FIRM']","['individual values', 'individual values', 'export performance', 'export performance', 'customer responsiveness', 'customer responsiveness', 'psychic distance', 'psychic distance', 'firm']",values export choice psychic distance
"Research Summary Strategic use of codified knowledge across borders can be a vital component for project-based work. Analyzing 237 global consulting projects, we examine the performance effects of drawing upon different types of codified knowledge. We argue and find that using principle-based forms of knowledge is likely to improve a project's customer responsiveness, whereas using template-based knowledge increases a project's cost effectiveness. We also explore what drives project managers to select different forms of knowledge in the first place. Specifically, we find that manager experience drives knowledge principle use, whereas institutional distance drives knowledge template use. Taken together, our findings suggest that organizations need to carefully consider the performance implications of different types of codified knowledge that get used and understand what drives managers to use them. Managerial Summary Managers understand the importance of knowledge management systems for project-based work. Efforts are often made to ensure that knowledge is codified and disseminated throughout the firm so employees can draw upon them to complete their projects. Unfortunately, however, such efforts often lead to stockpiles of information that remain untapped and underutilized. This study seeks to answer two questions. First, how can managers influence workers to utilize different types of codified knowledge in the first place? Second, do different types of codified knowledge have differential effects on performance? We find that increased individual experience drives the use of knowledge principles, whereas workers that are more distant are more likely to use knowledge templates. At the same time, we find that when individuals draw upon knowledge principles it increases the customer responsiveness of their projects, whereas the use of knowledge templates increases cost effectiveness. This suggests that project-based firms should carefully consider codifying both knowledge templates as well as knowledge principles and consider how to incentivize workers to draw upon these different forms of knowledge.","['Bayesian estimation', 'cross-border knowledge transfer', 'knowledge principles', 'knowledge templates', 'project performanceORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITIES', 'EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'SEARCH', 'REPLICATION', 'EXPERIENCE', 'IMITATION', 'LOCATION', 'SUBUNITS', 'VENTURES']","['knowledge principles', 'knowledge principles', 'knowledge templates', 'knowledge templates', 'management', 'search', 'experience']",work consulting performance institutional distance management
"We compare buyer-supplier links established by pairs of Japanese-owned automobile assemblers and component manufacturers operating in Japan and in North America during 1989-90. Eight assemblers and more than 170 Japanese component manufacturers had established North American manufacturing facilities. In total, Japanese automobile assembly organizations operating in North America had recreated about a quarter of their Japanese supply links. The suppliers that set up North American facilities had recreated almost 60 percent of their links with traditional buyers and formed more than 16 percent of the possible extension links with new assembler partners. We identify several economic and organizational factors that influence whether an existing buyer-supplier link will be recreated in a new location and whether firms that do not have a buyer-supplier relationship at home will form ala extension link in the new location. We find that the presence of a long-term buyer-supplier relationship, buyer and supplier entry timing to the new location, the joint venture status of the buyer, supplier size, and the breadth of a supplier's sales base in the home market influence the likelihood that links will be recreated and extension links will be formed.","['INTERFIRM RELATIONSHIPS', 'BUYER SUPPLIER STRATEGY', 'GLOBAL STRATEGY', 'AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRYUNITED-STATES', 'INDUSTRIAL-ORGANIZATION', 'VERTICAL INTEGRATION', 'AUTO INDUSTRY', 'DETERMINANTS', 'ALLIANCES', 'FIRM', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INVESTMENT']",['firm'],buyer supplier assembly organizations
"Through qualitative and empirical research, the authors find that the service quality construct conforms to the structure of a third-order factor model that ties service quality perceptions to distinct and actionable dimensions: outcome, interaction, and environmental quality. In turn, each has three subdimensions that define the basis of service quality perceptions. The authors further suggest that for each of these subdimensions to contribute to improved service quality perceptions, the quality received by consumers must be perceived to be reliable, responsive, and empathetic. The authors test and support this conceptualization across four service industries. They consider the research and managerial implications of the study and its limitations.","['nanCONSUMER PERCEPTIONS', 'PHYSICAL SURROUNDINGS', 'FIT INDEXES', 'MODEL', 'SATISFACTION', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'CONSUMPTION', 'ENCOUNTERS', 'CUSTOMERS', 'CONSEQUENCES']",['model'],environmental consumers
"The purpose of this article is to discuss two approaches to being market oriented-a market-driven approach and a driving-markets approach. Market driven refers to a business orientation that is based on understanding and reacting to the preferences and behaviors of players within a given market structure. Driving markets, on the other hand, implies influencing the structure of the market and/or the behavior(s) of market players in a direction that enhances the competitive position of the business. There are three generic ways of changing the structure of a marker: (I) eliminating players in a market (deconstruction approach), (2) building a new or modified set of players in a market (construction approach), and (3) changing the functions performed by players (functional modification approach). Market behavior can be modified directly or alternatively, indirectly by changing the mind-set of market players (e.g., customers, competitors, and other stakeholders).","['nanENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT', 'RESEARCH PROPOSITIONS', 'ORIENTATION', 'CONSTRUCT']","['orientation', 'construct']",structure deconstruction construction
This study compares the agency theory of the firm with interorganizational theory in examining the factors associated with the adoption of the poison pill-a takeover defense issued by a firm's board of directors that can dramatically increase the cost that a hostile buyer would have to pay to acquire the firm-by a panel of Fortune 500 firms between July 1984 and August 1989. The pill's rapid spread is traced to a combination of ownership structure and other firm-level factors and an interlock network diffusion process. The results support a social structural perspective on the market for corporate control in which the interlock network provides a social context favoring continued managerial dominance. The findings are also more consistent with models of cohesion rather than structural equivalence as the social structural mechanism responsible for diffusion.,"['nanGOLDEN PARACHUTES', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'COSTS', 'ORGANIZATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SECURITIES', 'STABILITY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'WEALTH']","['ownership structure', 'ownership structure', 'organization']",market

"Despite the assumption that symptoms of hypomania are detrimental, they may prove beneficial within self-employment contexts. Drawing on person-environment (P/E) fit theory and using the first National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol Related Conditions (NESARC 1), our conservative inferences are that for self-employed individuals, hypomania has a positive association with income, self-employed individuals with higher education have higher levels of income with increasing hypomania score, and older self-employed individuals with a higher hypomania score have a higher income. These findings have implications for the literature on hypomania symptoms and self-employment related labor market outcomes.","['hypomania score', 'income', 'self-employmentPERSON-ORGANIZATION FIT', 'DARK TRIAD TRAITS', 'BIPOLAR DISORDER', 'VENTURE PERFORMANCE', 'SENSATION SEEKING', 'MENTAL-DISORDERS', 'UNITED-STATES', 'ADHD SYMPTOMS', 'OLDER AGES', 'EFFICACY']","['hypomania score', 'hypomania score', 'income']",fit
"Category management (CM) is challenging for retailers that sell thousands of products across hundreds of categories and often lack the resources and capabilities to manage all of them intensively. Some retailers respond by picking one supplier to be a category captain that manages the category including rivals' brands on their behalf. Others worry that influential captains will be opportunistic and that the benefits of intensive CM are simply not worth the costs. However, there is little conceptual development or empirical evidence concerning CM best practices. The authors develop a comprehensive model of retail CM based on a synthesis of field interviews and relevant literature, especially work on governance value analysis theory. Their test of the model using category and financial growth data from U.S. supermarket chains shows that more intensive CM improves results. Furthermore, use of a category captain increases CM effort and results, without increasing opportunism or problems with other suppliers. The authors also find that retailers with more resources are less likely to rely on help from a category captain; yet the level of retailer resources is not related to CM intensity. Thus, go-it-alone retailers do not deploy their own resources on CM and miss out on the corresponding performance improvements.","['interorganization relationships', 'governance', 'channels of distribution', 'supplier networks', 'brand management', 'retailingGOVERNANCE VALUE ANALYSIS', 'ECONOMIC-ORGANIZATION', 'SUPPLIERS', 'CAPABILITIES', 'OPPORTUNISM', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INTEGRATION', 'NETWORK', 'CONTEXT', 'TRUST']","['governance', 'suppliers', 'capabilities', 'opportunism', 'performance']",category management governance growth

"Using a discourse-analytic approach, we examine the strategizing that occurred during an attempted acquisition in 2007/08 of Rio Tinto by BHP Billiton. In doing so, we contribute to discursive studies of mergers and acquisitions in two significant respects. First, we show the importance of studying how actors external to, as well as those internal to BHP, exerted influence over the acquisition process and outcome. Their influence can be attributed, in part, to their use of rhetorical strategies during the negotiation of the meanings of three constructs that were central to the acquisition discourse. Second, our study shows how these rhetorical strategies were put into effect using not only linguistic, but also non-linguistic modes of discourse such as imagery, indicators, and location. We conclude that obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the role of discourse in relation to a strategic activity - in this case an attempted acquisition - requires consideration of the multi-modal rhetorical strategies brought to bear by both external and internal actors.","['discourse', 'external actors', 'merger and acquisition', 'multi-modality', 'rhetoric', 'strategyORGANIZATIONAL DISCOURSE', 'DISCURSIVE LEGITIMATION', 'PRACTICE PERSPECTIVE', 'MEDIA TEXTS', 'MERGERS', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'CONTEXT', 'CORPORATION', 'SENSEMAKING', 'CAPITALISM']","['discourse', 'rhetoric', 'mergers']",mergers acquisitions
"Donations to large numbers of victims are typically muted relative to donations to a single identified victim. This article shows that people can donate more to large numbers of victims if these victims are perceived as entitative-comprising a single, coherent unit. For example, donations to help children in need are higher when the children comprise a family than when they have no explicit group membership. The same effect is observed on donations for endangered animals that are depicted as moving in unison. Perceived entitativity results in more extreme judgments of victims. Victims with positive traits are therefore viewed more favorably when entitative, triggering greater feelings of concern and higher donations.

"An important and underexamined issue in the study of callings concerns the challenges people face in pursuing a calling and how they negotiate those challenges. This process may be especially intense and consequential because callings involve work that is rooted in people's values and that matters a great deal to them. Drawing on narrative interviews with 50 animal shelter workers, we identify three different calling paths that evolve as employees respond to the challenges they encounter. While all individuals in our study entered animal shelter work with similar passion and purpose, and faced similar kinds of challenges, those on different paths interpreted challenges differently, had different emotional responses to them, engaged in different kinds of enacted sensemaking, and developed different accounts of themselves and their guiding purpose, through which they interpreted subsequent challenges. The result was the emergence of three increasingly divergent calling paths over time, culminating in different emotional, psychological, and behavioral outcomes. Based on these findings, we develop a model of the recursive process through which individuals negotiate the challenges of a calling, contributing to the literatures on callings and employee responses to workplace challenges.","['nanEMPLOYEE VOICE', 'JOB-ATTITUDES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'BEHAVIORS', 'PURSUIT', 'MODEL', 'PROACTIVITY', 'RESOURCES', 'TURNOVER', 'DEMANDS']",['model'],callings workplace
"The imputation problem is how to account for the sources of the value of the firm. I propose that part of the value of the firm derives from its participation in a network that emerges from the operation of generative rules that instruct the decision to cooperate.

"The emergence of moral leadership, discussed here as a situation wherein individuals take a moral stance on an issue, convince others to do the same, and together spur change in a moral system, abounds in practice. Existing ethical and moral leadership theories, however, have remained confined to micro-level behavioral research. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a process theory of the socially situated emergence of moral leadership and its development into a broader movement affecting moral systems within and across formal organizations. We theorize the pathways through which moral leadership emerges; the triggers that bring about moral awareness and the moral courage to offer an alternative moral stance toward an issue, and leaders' ability to deftly connect followers and their moral convictions into a broader movement, such that a moral system changes from within. With our process theory, we bridge between micro and macro levels of analysis, and highlight the crucial ability of leaders to be both principled and pragmatically savvy, and thus capable of bridging between their own moral convictions and those of others in order to develop a common and mutually binding ground toward change.","['nanETHICAL LEADERSHIP', 'RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP', 'INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE', 'BUSINESS ETHICS', 'BOUNDARY WORK', 'IDENTITY', 'VALUES', 'SYSTEMS', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'ORGANIZATION']","['systems', 'organization']",leadership organizations

"A firm's ability to offer better service and to co-create valuable customer experiences is critically important to achieving competitive advantage. Service-dominant (S-D) logic, along with resource and capability perspectives, provides the underlying theoretical reasoning for the relevance of such capabilities. However, despite researchers' recent contributions to marketing theory, empirical support for S-D logic and its implications is very limited at the strategic level. An open question, therefore, is what empirically constitutes a value co-creation capability, and what is its impact on important performance outcomes. Building on the conceptualization of an S-D orientation as a portfolio of value co-creation capabilities, this research first operationalizes and validates an S-D orientation measure through a multi-study approach across different contexts. The authors then apply the measurement instrument to an automotive retail setting to investigate the outcomes of S-D orientation in terms of both customer- and firm-related performance metrics. Results provide the first empirical demonstration of the importance of S-D capabilities, and thus S-D logic, for firms. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

An analysis of 172 members of 44 virtual communities found that the sense of virtual community is affected by the enthusiasm of the community's leaders, off-line activities available to members, and enjoyability. These characteristics had a stronger impact for members of virtual communities that originated on-line than for those in communities that originated off-line. The implications of the findings and future research directions are discussed.","['virtual community', 'virtual community origin', 'sense of virtual communitySCIENCE-FICTION FANDOM', 'INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY', 'COMMUNICATION', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'INTERNET', 'MEDIA']","['virtual community', 'virtual community']",virtual community virtual community virtual collaboration
"It has recently been argued that corporate social responsibility (CSR) is political'. It has been neglected however, that firms also operate politically in a traditional sense, in seeking to secure favourable political conditions for their businesses. We argue that there are potential synergies between CSR and corporate political activity (CPA) that are often overlooked by firms and that recognition of these synergies will stimulate firms to align their CSR and CPA. We develop a conceptual model that specifies how various configurations of a firm's CSR and CPA - alignment, misalignment, and non-alignment - affect the firm's reputation beyond the separate reputation effects of CSR and CPA. This model has important implications for understanding how and why firms should pay attention to their CPA and CSR configurations, and thereby contributes to the broader issue of why firms should make sure that they are consistent in terms of responding to stakeholder concerns.","['alignment', 'corporate political strategies', 'corporate social responsibility', 'nonmarket strategy', 'reputation', 'resource complementaritiesORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGY', 'BUSINESS', 'FIRM', 'LEGITIMACY', 'INSIGHTS', 'PHILANTHROPY', 'RESOURCES', 'MODEL']","['alignment', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'reputation', 'business', 'firm', 'model']",corporate social responsibility corporate political activity reputation
"In food packaging, light and pale colors are often used to highlight product healthiness. What has been largely overlooked is that this seemingly positive health cue may also convey another crucial piece of information. It is this paper's premise that light-colored packages evoke two opposing effects: They stimulate favorable health impressions (health effect) and they activate detrimental taste inferences (taste effect) which jointly guide the purchase decision. To contribute to a better understanding of when this package cue is an asset or a liability, this research elucidates the boundary conditions under which the opposing effects operate. The unfavorable color-induced taste effect should be particularly dominant when (i) consumers have a strong need to make heuristic taste inferences (i.e., when tasting is not possible) and (ii) when health is not the overarching goal (e.g., for less health-conscious consumers). A series of experiments manipulating actual food packages confirms that the package health cue can indeed trigger negative taste associations in the consumer's mind that backfire. Marketers therefore are advised to consider the identified contingencies carefully. (C) 2016 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Drawing on the strategic management and international business literatures, this study examines the relationships between the experiences of newly selected CEOs and their choice of foreign direct investment (FDI) entry modes. Based on a sample of 380 foreign market entry events involving acquisitions, greenfield investments, and joint ventures, our findings indicate that CEOs with less firm experience preferred acquisitions and greenfield investments to joint ventures and, older CEOs were more likely to opt for joint ventures over greenfield investments. In addition, CEOs with throughput functional experience favoured acquisitions over joint ventures and greenfield investments. Finally, CEO international experience was associated with a greater propensity to choose greenfield investments and acquisitions over joint ventures and also greenfield investments over acquisitions. The implications of the findings from the perspective of theory and managerial practice are discussed, along with possible directions for future research.","['nanTOP-MANAGEMENT-TEAM', 'INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION', 'JAPANESE INVESTORS', 'TACIT KNOWLEDGE', 'GLOBAL STRATEGY', 'JOINT-VENTURES', 'FIRM', 'IMPACT', 'SUCCESSION', 'OWNERSHIP']","['joint ventures', 'joint ventures', 'firm']",fdi entry modes investments joint ventures
"This study investigates the antecedents of an entrepreneur's day-level innovative behavior. Drawing on 2,420 data points from a 10-day experience sampling study with 121 entrepreneurs, we find that sleep quality is a precursor to an entrepreneur's subsequent innovative behavior, in accordance with the effort-recovery model. Moreover, sleep quality is positively related to high-activation positive moods (e.g., enthusiastic, inspired) and negatively related to high-activation negative moods (e.g., tension, anxiety). Our multilevel structural equation model indicates that high-activation positive moods mediate the relationship between sleep quality and innovative behavior on a given day. These results are relevant for managing entrepreneurial performance.","['sleep quality', 'emotions', 'experience sampling methodology', 'creativity', 'innovationEXPERIENCE SAMPLING METHODOLOGY', 'POSITIVE AFFECT', 'OPPORTUNITY EVALUATION', 'PROACTIVE BEHAVIOR', 'PERSONAL RESOURCES', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'WORK ENGAGEMENT', 'NEGATIVE AFFECT', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'SELF-EFFICACY']","['sleep quality', 'sleep quality']",model
"Proposed as a theory of motivation, the basic tenet of conservation of resources (COR) theory is that humans are motivated to protect their current resources and acquire new resources. Despite its recent popularity in the organizational behavior literature, several criticisms of the theory have emerged, primarily related to the central concept of resources. In this review, we address concerns regarding the conceptualization, conservation, acquisition, fluctuation, and measurement of resources. We highlight gaps in the COR literature that can be addressed by integrating research from other areas of psychology and management. In this manner, we hope to push the COR literature forward by resolving several concerns and providing suggestions for future research that might address other concerns.","['resources', 'motivation', 'stress', 'decision makingSELF-DETERMINATION THEORY', 'WORK-FAMILY-CONFLICT', 'PERSON-ENVIRONMENT FIT', 'EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'SOCIAL SUPPORT', 'NEED SATISFACTION', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'DAY-LEVEL', 'ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT']","['resources', 'motivation']",conservation management
"Funding pressures amidst the slow economic recovery from the late-2000's recession have forced universities, as well as other not-for-profit organizations, to increase the volume and sophistication of their direct marketing activities. The efficiency of direct marketing strategies is linked to an organization's ability to effectively target individuals. In this paper, we present a finite-mixture model framework to segment the alumni population of a university in the midwestern United States. Much of the research on customer segmentation summarizes response data (e.g., purchase and contribution histories) via recency, frequency and monetary value (RFM) statistics. Individuals sharing similar RFM characteristics are grouped together; the rationale being that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. Summary statistics such as RFM, however, introduce aggregation bias that mask the dynamics of purchase/contribution behavior. Accordingly, we implement latent-class segmentation models where alumni are classified based on how an individual's contribution sequence compares to those of other individuals. The framework's capability to process contribution sequences, i.e., longitudinal data, provides fundamental new insights into donor contribution behavior, and provides a rigorous mechanism to infer and segment the population based on unobserved heterogeneities (as well as based on other observable characteristics). Specifically, we analyze Markov mixture models to segment alumni based on contribution-behavior patterns, under the assumption of serially-dependent contribution sequences. We use the expectation-maximization algorithm to obtain parameter estimates for each segment. Through an extensive empirical study, we highlight the substantive insights gained through the processing of the full contribution sequences, and establish the presence of three distinct classes of alumni in the population (each with a discernible contribution pattern). The proposed framework, collectively, provides a basis to tailor direct marketing policies to optimize specific performance criteria (e.g., profits).

Based on a survey of 471 small and medium-sized enterprises in Korea, we found that MO and EO positively affect new product performance. The main impact of MO is through new product development proficiency and product meaningfulness and that of EO is through proficient intellectual property management and product novelty.

"We present a conceptual as well as empirical analysis showing that 11-12-year-old children, relative to adults, evaluate brand extensions by relying more on surface cues (e.g., brand name characteristics used to launch the extension) and less on deep cues (e.g., category similarity between the parent brand and the extension category). In experiment 1, children gave equivalent evaluations of brand extensions regardless of category similarity (e.g., Coca-Cola extending to iced tea vs. toffee), whereas adults rated near extensions (e.g., iced tea) more favorably than far extensions (e.g., toffee). In experiment 2, children evaluated near extensions more favorably than far extensions when they were cued to make similarity judgments prior to evaluation but rated near and far extensions equivalently when they were not cued prior to evaluation. In experiment 3, children based their evaluations on the extension name's linguistic characteristics regardless of category similarity, whereas adults based their evaluations on category similarity regardless of name characteristics. Children rated extensions with a rhyming name (e.g., Coca-Cola Gola iced tea; Wrigley's Higley toffee) more positively than extensions with a nonrhyming name (e.g., Coca-Cola Higley iced tea; 'Wrigley's Gola toffee), whereas adults rated them similarly.

"Recent studies have examined the determinants of international joint venture (IJV) formations and stock market reactions to such investments. Less is known, however, about the evolution of IJVs and the attendant performance implications for parent firms. This paper examines one specific type of IJV evolution, IJV internalization, whereby one firm acquires the IJV by buying out its partner(s). Standard agency theory variables are hypothesized to influence parent firm valuation effects. The results indicate that parent firm valuation effects are positively related to the parent firm equity owned by insiders and the interaction of debt financing and free cash flow.

"The creative destruction literature has argued that differences in R&D performance of incumbent vs. entrant firms can be explained through organizational change theories about established vs. de novo firms. A disconnect exists between these theories and the available empirical evidence because often the best performing firms are established firms as well. I propose to resolve this disconnect by distinguishing between market incumbency (presence in a market prior to a discontinuity) and organizational prehistory (organizational experience prior to a transition, whether between technologies or between markets). Doing so allows me to contrast incumbent vs. entrant and de alio vs. de novo studies, and to suggest more robust future research designs.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework to understand the influence that the social era is having on the value chain of the local news industry. The authors theoretically advance value chain theory by, firstly, considering the influence of community type and age on consumption and, secondly, exploring the role that consumers can play in value-adding activities. The theoretical contribution of this study lies in moving from a transactional approach towards consumer relationships in the value chain towards managing consumers as a source of relational value (e.g. co-creation and integrated perspectives). Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual framework is theoretically positioned in relation to community and digital community practices in the social era. A series of research questions are presented, then these questions are explored drawing on empirical data from the Pew database. The authors then advance the framework further to consider news firm strategy towards its consumers. Fifteen in-depth executive interviews were conducted with local news organizations in the Manchester area of the UK. Findings - The authors illustrate that different types of communities (merging cohorts and locations) are influencing levels of technological and social connectivity within the value chain. The authors also found that the news industry is experimenting with reconfiguring its consumer relations from a purely transactional to a co-created and participatory value-added activity in the social era. In terms of its policy impact, the findings in this paper show that the whole strategic value chain ideology of the news industry needs to change radically; away from its largely transactional (and lack of trust) approach in the ability of consumers to create value in the supply chain (other than to buy a product) and, move towards much greater consumer involvement and participation in value chain processes (creation, production and distribution of news products and services). Originality/value - The change associated with social media and connectivity is changing the way that different community types and consumer groups are now consuming and participating in news content creation. Unlike previous studies, the authors show that there is variance and complexity in the levels of consumer participation by community type/age group. Using the Pew data, the authors contribute to knowledge on the value creation strategy of news firms in the social era, by identifying how communicative, social and communicative logics influence value and co-creation activities in the local news supply chain. Through interviews, the authors advance value co-creation theory from its strategic and marketing origins to operational and supply chain implementation.","['Conceptual framework', 'Co-creation', 'Value chain', 'Newspaper supply chainJOURNALISM', 'MEDIA']","['conceptual framework', 'conceptual framework', 'co creation', 'co creation', 'value chain', 'value chain', 'media']",consumers co creation impact

"Previous research on the impact of chief executive officer (CEO) locus of control is mainly based on simple and partial mappings of bivariate associations between CEO locus of control and organizational outcomes. In addition, distinct substreams have emerged in which intricately related phenomena are studied separately. To overcome this fragmentation and polarization, we provide and empirically test an integrative framework based on previously tested hypotheses on the impact of CEO locus of control. Our approach differs from prior research in two ways. First, it simultaneously takes account of strategic choice and firm performance in order to assess the extent to which strategy mediates the relationship between CEO locus of control and organizational performance. Second, we consider the CEO to be both a formulator and implementor of organizational strategies. Besides the observation that CEO locus of control seems to matter a lot in terms of explaining organizational performance in the present sample, our results demonstrate that an integrative approach increases our insight into the impact of CEO locus of control by revealing why some CEOs achieve higher organizational performance than others.","['nanBUSINESS-UNIT PERFORMANCE', 'TOP-MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES', 'MANAGERIAL DISCRETION', 'CONTROL EXPECTANCIES', 'EXTERNAL-CONTROL', 'BEHAVIOR', 'TEAM', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL']","['organizational performance', 'organizational performance']",firm performance strategy
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to find out the current SCM skill development priorities in manufacturing firms and how the structural properties of the supply chain translate into demand for SCM skills in manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach - An internet survey was designed and conducted. The responses of 154 manufacturing companies operating in Finland were analysed through descriptive statistics and regression analyses. Findings - The supply chain management skills with an inter-organisational focus tend to have a higher development priority than the skills with an intra-organisational focus. The top five skills for development are: demand forecasting and supply planning; sourcing and supplier management; customer and distribution channel management; production planning and control; and information systems for logistics and production planning. Structural properties of the supply chain seem to have an effect on skills that are related to supply chain design and information flow infrastructure, i.e. the ability to locate the various nodes in the network, and to connect and coordinate their respective activities in the face of often uncertain demand. Research limitations/implications - The results are based on survey research with a limited sample size and geographic coverage with bias towards large firms. The research scope is further limited to investigating the influence of structural properties of the supply chain, leaving opportunities for further research on the demand for SCM skills. Originality/value - The authors report original findings that provide input to the development processes of training programmes and university curricula, related to supply chain management. They also initiate theory development on the determinants of demand for SCM skills.","['Supply chain management skills', 'Geographic dispersion', 'Supply chain tier', 'Manufacturing strategy', 'Supply chain management', 'Manufacturing industries', 'FinlandJUST-IN-TIME', 'LOGISTICS MANAGERS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INTEGRATION', 'FRAMEWORK', 'DEMAND', 'IMPACT', 'REQUIREMENTS', 'NONRESPONSE', 'CAPABILITY']","['supply chain management skills', 'supply chain management skills', 'supply chain management skills', 'supply chain management skills', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'demand']",finland supply chain management systems logistics

"Purpose - In the supply chain context, professionals manage various risks that have the potential to disrupt supplies. Surprisingly, one kind of risk is often overlooked: reputational risk. It is critical to recognise the risk potential that impacts on the reputation of the organisation. Furthermore, managers require an appropriate tool set to control it. The present paper aims to have a twin focus: first, it will lay out the basic premises behind corporate reputation, reputational risk, and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Second, the practical implications will be addressed that lead to a substantial teaching component. Design/methodology/approach - The present paper is based on two research stages. Initially, the authors adopted the reflective practitioner philosophy that aimed at discovering the common beliefs in practice that explain working processes and management thought. In particular, they explored the foundation of CSR, reputation and risk management with specialists in dedicated workshops (electronics, energy, life sciences, telecommunications and defence industries, located at different stages of the supply chain). To gain more insight, the authors subsequently conducted in-depth interviews in these topic areas with key informants. The combination allowed them methodological triangulation. Findings - Reputation can be created and controlled as soon as its nature is fully understood (Reputational Owner). Interestingly, it is a transceiving business phenomenon that crosses organizational boundaries. Spillover effects can thus be observed at all stages of the supply chain by mere business association (Reputational Borrower). Reputation can range from positive to negative extremes and needs to be managed. The results of the authors' exploratory work are presented as quotations to provide the substance of the current and relevant subject. Research limitations/implications - The present work is exploratory in nature. Quantitative research methods are now required to validate and substantiate the findings. Practical implications - CSR is a contemporary foundation to mitigate reputational risk throughout the supply chain. The authors outline the reputational risk factors in this context and the ways of managing those. Social implications - In the market place, reputation is a reflection of the supply chain offering (products, services), communication (promotion, PR), and action (behaviour and views expressed). Consumers adopt supply chain reputation as a yardstick when making purchase decisions. It is therefore critical to manage reputational risk in the supply chain and this paper outlines the cause and effect relationships that this topic entails in modern society. Originality/value - This paper discusses the importance of reputational risk in the supply chain. It also explains the ways it can be mitigated via CSR. This is the management baseline that adds tremendous value for theory builders and present and future managers. Having the education of Master students in mind, the authors outline three specific teaching units that bring the conceptual underpinnings alive in an interactive learning environment.","['Reputational risk', 'Corporate social responsibility', 'Teaching', 'Supply chain management', 'Market offering', 'Communication', 'Social responsibility', 'Risk managementCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'STOCK-MARKET REACTIONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CSR', 'GOVERNANCE', 'BUSINESS', 'SUSTAINABILITY', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'COMPANIES', 'MODEL']","['reputational risk', 'reputational risk', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'teaching', 'communication', 'social responsibility', 'social responsibility', 'csr', 'business']",reputational risk social responsibility csr
"Infusing stakeholder agency theory with insights from behavioural agency theory, we describe a frame-dependent relationship between CEO stock option incentives and tax avoidance. Our theoretical framework highlights the role of competing shareholder demands in providing a salient reference point for a CEO contemplating the implications of tax avoidance for their stock option wealth. In a study of 2,573 publicly listed U.S. firms between 1993 and 2014, we show that the implications of CEO stock option incentives are contingent on whether the firm's effective tax rate is anticipated to be below or above the tax rate of peer firms - an outcome that the CEO can cast as balancing stakeholder demands. Consistent with our theoretical reasoning, we also show that, both above and below this reference point, the implications of option incentives for corporate tax avoidance are amplified by the level of activist institutional ownership and attenuated by the CEO's ability to unwind their bond with shareholders through hedging. In doing so, our study offers an impetus for a broader stakeholder approach to governance research examining CEO incentive alignment.","['behavioural agency', 'stakeholder agency', 'executive compensation', 'corporate tax avoidanceHEDGE FUND ACTIVISM', 'QUANTILE REGRESSION', 'PROSPECT-THEORY', 'FIRM', 'GOVERNANCE', 'RISK', 'INCENTIVES', 'OWNERSHIP', 'MODEL', 'SENSITIVITIES']","['behavioural agency', 'behavioural agency', 'stakeholder agency', 'stakeholder agency', 'firm', 'governance', 'incentives', 'ownership']",tax avoidance
"Entrepreneurs comprise the majority of the richest people in the world. Their venture exits, or more specifically harvests, often represent the events through which they accrue this great wealth. Following these harvests, entrepreneurs make critical decisions with their financial resources that can have a profound impact on society. Through content analysis of The Giving Pledge letters and in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs, we explore how and why entrepreneurs redistribute their resources following harvests, and we reveal four mechanisms - intrinsic motivation, identification, personal power, and stewardship norms - that drive these philanthropic decisions.

"Choosing the right international market entry mode is of utmost importance for an internationalizing firm. However, there is a lack of analysis concerning the decision-making process (DMP), specifically with regard to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The authors study the DMP among SMEs intent on entering international markets and how it affects each firm's international market development strategy. Using six cases based in Finland and Italy, the authors develop a model of the SME DMP. Their results imply that the DMP evolves and goes through various phases. By focusing on the postentry phase, this study enhances knowledge on decision-making frameworks by linking the traditional international marketing literature related to initial entry mode with mainstream international business literature. Furthermore, the study reveals that SMEs adopting a more rational DMP are more likely to succeed in foreign markets, and consequently, it demonstrates the importance of real options reasoning as a theoretical lens for making entry mode decisions in the context of SMEs.","['international market entry', 'market entry strategy', 'decision making', 'small and medium-sized enterprises', 'entry and expansion modesREAL OPTIONS LOGIC', 'MODE CHOICE', 'FIRMS', 'STRATEGY', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'PERFORMANCE', 'BUSINESS', 'EFFECTUATION', 'INFORMATION', 'OPPORTUNITIES']","['international market entry', 'international market entry', 'international market entry', 'decision making', 'decision making', 'small and medium sized enterprises', 'small and medium sized enterprises', 'small and medium sized enterprises', 'small and medium sized enterprises', 'small and medium sized enterprises', 'strategy', 'business']",entry mode decision making process small and medium sized enterprises market real options

"This study explores how reflexivity contributes to the continuation of value creation for consumers throughout consumption journeys. Reflexivity is awareness of the self within the world. Our study establishes a framework for studying consumption journeys centered on progressive engagement with a practicein this case surfingover time. We discover that reflexivity manifests in consumption journeys in an iterative, recursive manneri.e., recursive reflexivitytacking between identity (mis)alignment (with dominant institutions) and reflexive outcomes, such as imitating, improving, adapting and reconciling. Our findings reveal that recursive reflexivity contributes to the continuation of value creation in consumption journeys by fostering practice continuityi.e., immersion, adaptation, innovation and/or dissolution of a practicewhich provides opportunities for enhanced consumption experiences and supports the evolution of identity projects. These findings deepen the understanding of how practices, identity, and institutions contribute to value creation. Implications from these findings suggest that firms should pay close attention to recursive reflexivity and practice continuity to cultivate value creation with consumers by (a) providing opportunities for enhanced consumption experiences, (b) aligning or misaligning brand identity with dominant institutions, and (c) sparking imagining, identity evolution, and practice innovation.","['Reflexivity', 'Consumption journey', 'Value creation', 'Practices', 'Identity', 'Institutions', 'ImaginationCONSUMER CULTURE', 'IDENTITY', 'ETHNOGRAPHY', 'IMAGINATION', 'EXPERIENCE', 'INNOVATION', 'CONTEXT']","['reflexivity', 'consumption journey', 'consumption journey', 'value creation', 'value creation', 'practices', 'identity', 'institutions', 'identity', 'experience', 'innovation']",reflexivity value creation consumers consumption journeys self time identity brand innovation
"This study incorporates the external environmental context into the study of corporate acquisitions by examining the performance implications of corporate acquisitions during an environmental jolt that alters the levels of environmental munificence. We posit that compared to the periods before and after an environmental jolt, corporate acquisitions during a jolt would be positively related to firm performance. Furthermore, we suggest that organizational slack would improve firm performance and accentuate the positive relationship between corporate acquisitions and firm performance during an environmental jolt; however, it would have negative impact on firm performance and make the acquisition-performance relationship more negative before and after a jolt. Using the Asian Economic Crisis as a natural experiment, we found general support for our core arguments based on a sample of firms from Hong Kong and Singapore. Our work demonstrates that firms can capitalize on the opportunities created by the changes in an environmental jolt.

"Research summary This article investigates how diversified firms reallocate internal non-scale free resources when one of their product business units (BUs) experiences increased exposure to international competition driven by a sharp decrease in trade tariffs. On average, firms tend to fight, by reallocating resources toward the BU affected by the trade shock and away from other BUs within the same firm. Two variables moderate this first-order effect with opposite signs. The level of sunk costs of the assets allocated to the BU affected by the shock is a positive moderator of resource reallocation to it. The presence of technological synergies between the BU affected and the rest of BUs instead moderates the relationship negatively. This negative moderation seems to only take place when competitionincreasesthe value of technology as a competitive resource. Managerial summary An important question in the strategic decision-making process of diversified firms is how to react to competitive threats that affect one business unit but not the others. Should managers allocate more resources to the affected business or should they instead reduce their commitment and use the same resources in the remaining operating sectors? In this article, we examine firms' reallocation decisions following increases in foreign competition due to import tariff cuts. Our results show that firms tend to allocate more resources to the business affected by the tariff cut and less to the businesses unaffected. Furthermore, we find evidence that this behavior is positively associated with performance.","['competition', 'diversification', 'opportunity cost', 'performance', 'resource redeploymentEXTERNAL FINANCING CONSTRAINTS', 'CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION', 'OPPORTUNITY COSTS', 'DARK SIDE', 'CAPACITY', 'ENTRY', 'SCOPE', 'CASH', 'REDEPLOYABILITY', 'GOVERNANCE']","['competition', 'performance']",trade decision making
"Drawing from a participant-observer study of volunteering in the context of UK music festivals, we examine how the sense of meaningfulness and community relate to instrumental goals of consumption and efficiency. We argue that the liminal nature of the festival setting supports an ambivalence in which meaningfulness is established through constructions of community, while the commodification of community feelings leads to heterogeneous understandings of the work setting. Our findings reveal heterogeneous ways in which work was rendered meaningful by festival volunteers, ranging from (1) A commodity frame, characterizing work as drudgery seeking 'fun' through consumption (2) A 'communitas' frame, emphasizing a transcendental sense of collective immediacy and (3) A cynical frame, where communitas discourse is used instrumentally by both managers and workers. We discuss meaningful work as caught between creative community and ideological mystification, and how alternative workspaces vacillate between emancipatory principles of solidarity and neo-normative forms of ideological control.","['meaningful work', 'liminality', 'music festivals', 'transitory spaces', 'volunteerMANAGEMENT', 'LABOR', 'CALL', 'LIFE']","['meaningful work', 'meaningful work', 'music festivals', 'music festivals']",music
"In this paper we analyze business planning from the perspective of the nascent entrepreneur. We measure its value for the entrepreneur at the point where he must decide whether or not to plan, and we contrast our results with empirical studies that compare firms performance after market entry. Within a formal decision-theoretical framework we show that the value of planning is driven by the possibility of evaluating alternative actions and being able to improve strategies. Before market entry, the main purpose of evaluation is to pursue good and terminate bad business ideas. We show how the value of planning is determined by the venture under consideration and how it depends on the quality of planning. Our theoretical model yields several behavioral and statistical implications that we compare with empirical observations found in the literature. In particular, we show how our model of rational decision making can be used to explain important hypotheses and contradictory observations that have fueled the debate on business planning.

"Drawing from signaling theory, this study investigates the processes through which corporate image (CI) for quality affects attitudinal loyalty. The research hypotheses are examined using data from a cross-sectional survey and two scenario-based experiments. Overall, findings across these three studies suggest that the effects of CI upon loyalty are channeled through customer satisfaction and perceived value. The effects of CI on perceived value and loyalty are stronger relative to the effects of employee interaction quality (IQ) when IQ is measured as an overall evaluation. However, when employee IQ is measured in reference to a specific service encounter, it becomes a stronger driver of perceived value and loyalty relative to CI. Regardless of the context of measurement (i.e., overall evaluation vs. a specific service encounter), employee IQ exerts a stronger influence on customer satisfaction than CI. CI negatively moderates the effect of employee IQ on customer satisfaction and loyalty, rendering the effect of employee IQ upon customer evaluations less critical for service providers with stronger CIs. The findings highlight the relevance and importance of CI as a signal of unobservable quality, which should be measured and closely monitored by management. Managers should also recognize the central role of customer satisfaction, especially in channeling the effects of IQ upon loyalty, and therefore, design policies that enhance frontline employee ability and motivation to deliver satisfying customer experiences.","['corporate image', 'employee interaction quality', 'signaling theory', 'attitudinal loyalty', 'common method biasCUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'PRODUCT QUALITY', 'REPUTATION', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'MODEL', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'INFORMATION', 'JUDGMENTS', 'SHARE']","['corporate image', 'corporate image', 'employee interaction quality', 'employee interaction quality', 'employee interaction quality', 'signaling theory', 'signaling theory', 'attitudinal loyalty', 'attitudinal loyalty']",signaling theory corporate image loyalty customer satisfaction perceived value quality iq
"We conduct an ethnographic case study of poor migrant women living in a Turkish squatter to explore how consumer acculturation operates in this important context. Poor migrants have no choice but to engage Turkish consumer culture because it is hegemonic and it conflicts ideologically with their village culture, and they do so with few resources. Our dominated consumer acculturation model specifies three modes of acculturation structured by this context: migrants reconstitute their village culture in the city, shutting out the dominant ideology; or they collectively pursue the dominant ideology as a myth through ritualized consumption; or they give up on both pursuits, resulting in a shattered identity project.","['nanCONSUMPTION', 'IMMIGRANTS', 'CULTURE']",['culture'],consumer acculturation model consumption identity

"The current literature presents a mixed view of top managers, often characterizing them as an impediment to innovation, irrelevant for innovation, or, at best, having an indirect effect on innovation. In contrast, the authors use an attentional perspective to argue that chief executive officers (CEOs) have a positive, direct, and long-term impact on how firms detect, develop, and deploy new technologies over time. The authors test their arguments on longitudinal data from the U.S. retail banking industry. They show that CEO attention is a critical driver of innovation even (1) when the target of attention is not innovation per se but simply future events and external events in a generic sense; (2) when the innovation outcomes occur far in the future (sometimes several years in the future); (3) when the innovation outcomes are conceptually, empirically, and temporally distinct; and (4) in an empirical context (i.e., banking) that is not traditionally viewed as high tech and, thus, innovation centric.","['nanMARKET ORIENTATION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGIC ORIENTATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'FIRM', 'CAPABILITIES', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'MANAGERIAL', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DETERMINANTS']",['firm'],attentional firms attention
"Loyalty programs have become an important component of firms' relationship management strategies. There are now some industries in which numerous rival loyalty programs are offered, inducing intense competition among these programs. However, existing research on loyalty programs has often studied such programs in a noncompetitive setting and has often focused on a single program in isolation. Addressing this gap, this research examines the effect of a firm's competitive positioning and market saturation on the performance of the firm's loyalty program. Based on the analysis of firm- and individual-level data from the airline industry, the results indicate that larger firms tend to benefit more from their loyalty program offerings than smaller firms. Moreover, when the product category demand is rigid, the impact of an individual loyalty program decreases as the marketplace becomes more saturated with competing programs. However, when the product category is highly expandable, the saturation effect disappears. Under such situations, loyalty programs can help an industry gain competitive advantage over substitute offerings outside the industry, and multiple programs can effectively coexist even under a high level of market saturation.","['loyalty programs', 'market share', 'market saturation', 'category expandability', 'resource-based viewBEHAVIORAL LOYALTY', 'CUSTOMER RETENTION', 'BRAND', 'CAPABILITIES', 'DETERMINANT', 'ADVANTAGE']","['loyalty programs', 'loyalty programs', 'market saturation', 'market saturation', 'advantage']",loyalty programs loyalty programs industry advantage
"Purpose - Scale purification - the process of eliminating items from multi-item scales - is widespread in empirical research, but studies that critically examine the implications of this process are scarce. The goals of this research are threefold: to discuss the methodological underpinning of scale purification, to critically analyze the current state of scale purification in supply chain management (SCM) research and to provide suggestions for advancing the scale-purification process. Design/methodology/approach - A framework for making scale-purification decisions is developed and used to analyze and critically reflect on the application of scale purification in leading SCM journals. Findings - This research highlights the need for rigorous scale-purification decisions based on both statistical and judgmental criteria. By applying the proposed framework to the SCM discipline, a lack of methodological rigor and coherence is identified when it comes to current purification practices in empirical SCM research. Suggestions for methodological improvements are provided. Research limitations/implications - The framework and additional suggestions will help to advance the knowledge about scale purification. Originality/value - This paper demonstrates that the justification for scale purification needs to be driven by reliability, validity and parsimony considerations, and that this justification needs to be based on both statistical and judgmental criteria.","['Surveys', 'Empirical study', 'Reliability', 'Structural equation model', 'Measurement', 'Literature review', 'Validity', 'Scale purification', 'Item elimination', 'ParsimonySUPPLY CHAIN', 'CONSTRUCT MEASUREMENT', 'FACE VALIDITY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGIES', 'ATTITUDE', 'MODELS', 'IMPACT']","['reliability', 'validity', 'scale purification', 'scale purification', 'management']",scale purification supply chain management decisions
"This paper conducts an empirical study as to whether family firms are more socially responsible than their nonfamily counterparts and explores the conditions in which this difference in social behavior occurs. We argue that family firms, given their socioemotional wealth bias, have a positive effect on social dimensions linked to external stakeholders, yet have a negative impact on internal social dimensions. Thus, family firms can be socially responsible and irresponsible at the same time. We also suggest that institutional and organizational conditions act as catalysts in the relationship between firm type and corporate social responsibility (CSR). General support for our thesis that family firms neglect internal social dimensions came from the study of a sample of 598 listed European firms over a period of 4 years. Moreover, while national standards and industry conditions influence the degree of CSR in nonfamily firms, these factors do not affect family firms. However, family firms' social activities are more sensitive to declining organizational performance.","['nanSOCIOEMOTIONAL WEALTH', 'INSTITUTIONAL PRESSURES', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'BOARD COMPOSITION', 'AGENCY', 'OWNERSHIP', 'MANAGEMENT', 'TIES', 'DETERMINANTS', 'SALIENCE']",['ties'],family firms nonfamily social behavior socioemotional wealth corporate social responsibility organizational performance
"From the resource-based perspective, organization learning is the foundation of firms creating their special resources and thereby increasing their competitive advantage. Organization learning is indeed derived from individual learning within the organization. However, many firms have adopted downsizing strategies to reduce the redundancy. Nevertheless, it had a great impact both on laid-off employees and remaining ones. The remaining employees lost their trust, loyalty toward the firm and eventually left. The consequence not only affected the firms' daily operation but also impacted employees' learning motivation for improving their ability to enhance the firm's competitive advantage. In the post-downsizing era, applying appropriate human resource management practices to motivate employees would be a critical issue. The study began with two psychological constructs: job satisfaction and learning commitment to explore the content of job satisfaction which significantly influenced remaining employees' learning commitment. The study used both qualitative and quantitative methods to collect and analyze the data. The results revealed that the two criterion in job satisfaction the relationship with colleagues and the relationship with the family significantly influenced employees' learning commitment. However, this was clearly different from managers' subjective expectation. The findings provide important implications for both the research field and practical management of downsizing, employee motivation, cross-culture management and strategic HRM practices.

"We investigate the relationships between two types of change-oriented leadership (transformational leadership and managerial openness) and subordinate improvement-oriented voice in a two-phase study. Findings from 3,149 employees and 223 managers in a restaurant chain indicate that openness is more consistently related to voice, given controls for numerous individual differences in subordinates' personality, satisfaction, and job demography. This relationship is shown to be mediated by subordinate perceptions of psychological safety, illustrating the importance of leaders in subordinate assessments of the risks of speaking up. Also, leadership behaviors have the strongest impact on the voice behavior of the best-performing employees.","['nanIMPRESSION MANAGEMENT', 'WORK', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ISSUES', 'SILENCE', 'SATISFACTION', 'PERSONALITY', 'CONSTRUCT', 'EXCHANGE', 'VALIDITY']","['satisfaction', 'personality']",transformational personality satisfaction
"Research Summary: To prevent loss of control post-IPO, founder-CEOs can implement control-enhancing mechanisms disconnecting ownership from voting rights. However, this decision places them in a rich versus king dilemma. If they choose to implement such mechanisms and secure the king position, they risk losing money at IPO. If they choose not to implement control-enhancing mechanisms and adopt the rich position they risk losing control over the firm. We investigate theoretically and empirically the outcomes of this dilemma in a multi-period setting (at IPO and post-IPO). We found that the majority of founder-CEOs who choose the king option recover initial wealth loss, and hence, they can reconcile the rich and king paths in the long-run post-IPO. Managerial Summary: Founder-CEOs often use control-enhancing mechanisms (CEMs), such dual class shares, pyramid control structures, and pact agreements, to maintain control over their IPO firms. In this study, we investigate the effects of these CEMs on firm value at IPO and post-IPO using a unique hand-collected dataset comprising all founder-CEO led firms that went public on French regulated markets between January 1992 and December 2010. We found that most founder-CEOs who use multiple CEMs leave considerable amounts of money on the table at IPO date but they are able to recover their initial loss 5 years post-IPO. This result suggests that an IPO may constitute a valuable financing alternative even for founder-CEOs who value control.","['anti-takeover mechanisms', 'founder-CEOs', 'IPOs', 'ownership structure', 'principal-principal agency costINITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS', 'SOCIAL EMBEDDEDNESS RECONCILIATION', 'PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTORS', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'MANAGERIAL MYOPIA', 'CORPORATE-CONTROL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FIRMS', 'POWER']","['founder ceos', 'founder ceos', 'firms']",ceos ownership firm

We also use the model to explore breakouts from organizational path dependence and discuss implications for managing and researching organizational paths.","['nanDOUBLE BIND', 'INERTIA', 'DYNAMICS', 'TRAJECTORIES', 'CAPABILITIES', 'EVOLUTION', 'INSTITUTIONALIZATION', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'INNOVATIONS', 'COMPETITION']",['dynamics'],lock in

We also find that human resource slack enhances short-term market expansion, but slows down short-term product expansion.

"Research summary: Prior work has shown that the strength of the intellectual property regime (IPR) in a host country influences offshore R&D to that country. Building on this work we propose that the strength of the IPR in a host country differentially influences the threat of knowledge leakage on projects that are produced for the location where the multinational firm is headquartered (home) versus the offshore location to which the R&D project is sent (host). We argue and show that when the host location has a weak IPR, fewer host inventors are involved in host R&D projects when compared to home R&D projects. We test our hypotheses using a dataset of patents held by US assignees, but coinvented in 43 host locations with differing IPR strength.Managerial summary: Multinational enterprises often cite the weak IPRs at emerging economy host destinations as a significant impediment to offshore R&D activities in those countries, despite the abundant supply of inexpensive scientific talent there. We find that the weak IPR at the host destination is a greater impediment to offshore R&D that is aimed for end use at the host market than for R&D that is aimed for end use globally or in the home market. Since IPRs are local, a weaker IPR at the host location does not protect IP that is relevant to the host market. Since the IPR at the home country is more relevant for technologies aimed at the home market, the IPR at the host country is irrelevant for such R&D projects.

"This study provides evidence regarding the strategic dynamics of competitive clusters. Firms that agglomerate (co-locate) may benefit from the differentiation of competitors without making similar differentiating investments themselves. Alternatively, co-locating with a high percentage of firms with low-cost strategic orientations reduces performance for firms pursuing high levels of differentiation. Further, the lowest-cost providers with the greatest strategic distance from the norm of the competitive cluster reap the greatest benefit from co-location with differentiated firms. We find empirical support for these ideas using a sample of 14,995 U.S. lodging establishments, and controlling for a number of key demand-shaping factors.","['nanMANHATTAN HOTEL INDUSTRY', 'EXTERNALITIES', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'NETWORKS', 'CLUSTERS', 'DYNAMICS']","['clusters', 'dynamics']",clusters differentiation

Next, the author presents some history on the concept of induction in philosophy and of inductive theory building in the hard sciences (e.g., Aristotle, Bacon, Newton). This is followed by three examples of successful theory building by induction in psychology and management (Beck's theory, Bandura's social-cognitive theory, goal setting theory).

"Research Summary Over half a century after Merton's (1963) description of simultaneous discoveries as a strategic research site for social science, they are hardly ever studied. This paper illustrates the potential of this phenomenon as a research tool. First, I describe their vast theoretical potential for strategy and innovation research and review prior works on the topic. Second, I describe a new method that generates lists of recent simultaneous discoveries in science systematically and automatically using openly available sources. Third, I make the resulting dataset available for anyone to use. Managerial Summary Despite much anecdotal evidence that different people can simultaneously come up with essentially the same creative idea, little attention has been given to this phenomenon. Yet, idea twins have a deep impact on creative workers, and can teach us a lot about strategy and innovation. In this paper, I describe their potential as a research tool and the types of questions they can help to answer.

"The present work examines the role of creativity-contingent monetary versus social-recognition rewards on creative performance and provides new insights into the underlying motivational processes through which these rewards affect consumer creativity. A series of five studies demonstrate that within the context of creativity contingency, monetary rewards induce a performance focus, while social-recognition rewards induce a normative focus. Such performance (normative) focus in turn enhances (attenuates) approach motivation to be original and hence leads to higher (lower) originality in a creative task. Thus, this work not only advances the current understanding of how and why two types of widely used creativity-contingent external rewards may have contrasting effects on creative performance, but it also offers important practical insights to managers who utilize reward systems in cultivating consumer creativity in their innovation platforms.","['creativity', 'innovation', 'approach motivation', 'monetary rewards', 'normative focus', 'social-recognition rewardsINTRINSIC MOTIVATION', 'AVOIDANCE MOTIVATION', 'INNOVATIVENESS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'CONSTRAINTS', 'ORIENTATION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'THINKING', 'SEEKING', 'IMPACT']","['creativity', 'innovation', 'approach motivation', 'approach motivation', 'monetary rewards', 'monetary rewards', 'normative focus', 'normative focus']",recognition performance originality innovation
"We examine how cognitive style, as measured by the MBTI, affects strategic decision outcomes. Executives participated in a simulated strategic decision making environment that allowed controlled collection of decision outcomes, including manager decisiveness, decision quality, and perceived effectiveness. We found that iNtuiting/Thinking managers used their intuition to make cognitive leaps based on objective information to craft more decisions of higher quality than other managers. In contrast, Sensing/Feeling types used time to seek socially acceptable decisions, which led to the lowest number of decisions and the lowest perceived effectiveness of all. We found no effect on decisiveness or perceived effectiveness based on a manager's preference for Perceiving or Judging. However, we found that others perceived Extraverted managers as being more effective than Introverted managers when, in fact, the Extraverts were no more decisive than Introverts. Thus, cognitive style influences actual decision outcomes as well as how others perceive one's decision performance.","['nanTOP-MANAGEMENT-TEAM', 'BRIGGS TYPE INDICATOR', 'MANAGERIAL', 'HETEROGENEITY', 'ORGANIZATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONFLICT', 'RESOURCE', 'VALIDITY', 'BEHAVIOR']",['performance'],making
"Positive manager-subordinate relationships are invaluable to organizations because they enable positive employee attitudes, citizenship behaviors, task performance, and more effective organizations. Yet extant theory provides a limited perspective on the factors that create these types of relationships. We highlight the important role subordinates also play in affecting the resource pool and propose that a subordinate's multiple identities can provide him or her with access to knowledge and social capital resources that can be utilized for work-based tasks and activities. A manager and a subordinate may prefer similar or different strategies for managing the subordinate's multiple identities, however, which can affect resource utilization and the quality of the manager-subordinate relationship. Our variance model summarizes our predictions about the effect of managers' and subordinates' strategy choices on the quality of manager-subordinate relationships.

"Theoretical and empirical research regarding the impact of corporate ownership on the behaviour and performance of firms have typically focused on consequences stemming from the separation of ownership and control. While large scale business enterprise characterized by such a separation is dominant in the US, Japan and the UK, firms in which ownership and control is coupled in the hands of individuals and their families are apparent in many other large developed economies and are dominant in most emerging markets. This paper examines consequences regarding the generation and allocation of financial resources stemming from the coupling of ownership and control among Hong Kong based firms. In doing so, we join insights from the economics literature regarding the incentive and risk bearing consequences of coupled ownership and control with the extant management, sociology and history literatures regarding Chinese family business groups and develop and six hypotheses pertaining to patterns in the allocation of financial resources. Results indicate that coupled ownership and control is positively related with dividend payout levels and financial liquidity while it is negatively related to investments in capital expenditures. Consistent with these results, we also find that coupled ownership and control is positively related to short-term (accounting) profitability.","['nanCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'CORPORATE-OWNERSHIP', 'BUSINESS GROUPS', 'GOVERNANCE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'BEHAVIOR', 'COSTS']","['corporate ownership', 'corporate ownership', 'business groups', 'business groups', 'consequences', 'performance', 'management']",kong

"Restaurants with 20 or more locations will soon be required to disclose calorie information on menus and menu boards. Retailers not included in this mandate can choose to voluntarily provide calorie information. To better understand the implications of this major policy change for food retailers, this research examines how consumers' retailer-related responses are affected by menu calorie labeling. A framework based on the attribution theory and the health halo literatures is developed, and three primary studies, including a field experiment, are used to test the proposed direct, moderating, and mediating effects derived from this conceptualization. Findings across the studies show that menu calorie labeling has a positive direct effect on perceptions of the restaurant's concern for customers' well-being and positive indirect effects on attitudes toward the restaurant and patronage intentions. However, these direct and indirect effects are attenuated when the restaurant is perceived to be more (vs. less) healthful and when menu calorie labeling is mandatory (vs. voluntary). The implications of these findings for retail and restaurant management are discussed. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The present study investigates these issues by considering both the speed and the reasons for leaving, examining a wider range of personality variables as predictors by including both bright and dark traits, and exploring the potential moderating effect of time in such predictions. Data were collected from a sample of 617 employees working in an electronics manufacturing firm in the United States. Using a Bayesian survival analysis framework, we found that dark traits were just as useful in predicting turnover outcomes as traditional personality traits and best predicted the specific turnover reasons, deviant behavior and no call no show.

"Human-computer negotiation has the potential to play an important role in today's highly dynamic online environment, especially in business-to-consumer e-commerce transactions. However, the lack of research on effective automated negotiation algorithms to respond to human buyers' strategic and/or tactic offers has limited the development of automated human-computer negotiation systems for real-world applications. Intelligent software agents that are capable of dynamically adjusting their negotiation strategy in response to human buyers' offers can greatly improve the negotiation experience of human buyers. In this study, guided by design science principles, we design a portfolio strategy model, which implements four negotiation strategies (i.e., time-dependent, behavior-dependent, dynamic time-dependent, and impasse resolution) as the core of our software agent for negotiating with human buyers. To evaluate this novel model, we implement a prototype of the system and compare it with three benchmark single-strategy models (i.e., competitive, collaborative, and selection) in human-computer negotiation experiments. The results show that our model not only enables the software agent to outperform its human counterpart but also significantly increases the settlement ratio and the joint outcome of both parties.","['Electronic commerce', 'automated negotiation', 'negotiation strategy', 'human-computer interaction', 'design science', 'human-computer negotiation', 'software agents', 'online negotiationSCIENCE RESEARCH', 'TASK COMPLEXITY', 'SOFTWARE AGENT', 'DECEPTION', 'COMMERCE', 'SYSTEMS', 'MODEL', 'AUCTIONS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'TACTICS']","['automated negotiation', 'automated negotiation', 'negotiation strategy', 'negotiation strategy', 'design science', 'design science', 'human computer negotiation', 'human computer negotiation', 'human computer negotiation', 'software agents', 'software agents', 'software agent', 'software agent', 'commerce', 'systems', 'model', 'behavior']",computer negotiation buyers
"Cooperative advertising plays a strategically important role in marketing programs. In this paper, we use a game theoretical model to study not only cooperative advertising but also pricing strategy in a manufacturer-e-retailer supply chain with the consideration of product categories. First, two cooperative advertising models ( the leader-follower Stackelberg and the strategic alliance) are established and analyzed. We then compare the two models to develop some important theories and managerial insights. Furthermore, we utilize a bargaining model to implement profit sharing and determine the manufacturer's participation rate for cooperative advertising in the channel coordination of strategic alliance. Based on our results, we derive optimal market strategies and identify probable paths of future research.","['E-marketing', 'Cooperative advertising', 'Product categories', 'Channel coordination', 'Pricing strategy', 'Marketing researchCHANNEL COORDINATION', 'GAME-THEORY', 'CONSUMER']","['cooperative advertising', 'cooperative advertising', 'product categories', 'product categories', 'channel coordination', 'channel coordination', 'pricing strategy', 'pricing strategy']",advertising model alliance

"Inclusive markets are key to fostering female entrepreneurship, and the microfinance sector has recognized and acted on this. Existing research has studied how institutions and organizational factors facilitate the process by which microfinance and other financial intermediaries tackle gender-based financial exclusion. But while the role of cultural institutions has been recognized as important, little research has systematically integrated culture in the study of gender-based financial exclusion. We posit that language is a cultural institution that influences the extent to which financial intermediaries are successful in outreaching women and supporting female entrepreneurship. Inspired by a performativity approach, we develop a set of hypotheses that delineate how a specific feature of language, gender marking in grammar, moderates the role of institutional (state capacity) and organizational (NGO status and global ties) factors in shaping microfinance outreach to women. Using the ratio of female to male borrowers in 2361 micro finance organizations from 115 countries during the period 1995-2015, we confirm that market inclusion of women depends on organizational and institutional factors, and that gender marking in grammar influences those relationships.","['nanGENDER', 'DIRECTIONS', 'INEQUALITY', 'FINANCE']",['finance'],microfinance language micro organizations
"Does the strategic type of firm affect which success measures should be used for product development (PD) projects? This paper theorizes that it should and finds that it does because the PD projects undertaken are usually an expression of the strategic type of the firm. The purpose of this research is to affirm a 1996 survey of members of the Product Development & Management Association (PDMA) that proposes that firms' PD performance measures should vary by their strategic type. Thus, for example, prospectors, the strategic type most likely to introduce new products to new markets, should place greater importance on PD success measures consistent with their characteristic strategies of changing product lines and early market entry. In contrast, defenders, the strategic type most likely to maintain stable product lines for existing markets, should place greater importance on PD success measures consistent with their characteristic strategies of stable product lines and market penetration. Analyzers, a hybrid type between prospectors and defenders, should prefer measures consistent with their characteristic strategies for improving products and being early followers in newer markets. To relate strategic types to specific success measures for PD projects, this paper proposes a model of the relationship based on the degree of project newness to the firm and then catalogs measures of PD project success and groups them according to degree of project newness. The research findings are based on survey responses from 222 individuals who are employed by financial service providers, who identified their firms by strategic type and rated the importance of PD success measures to their firms. The importance of 21 performance measures is compared by strategic type to find significant differences among prospectors, analyzers, and defenders. This research finds several significant relationships. prospectors, for example, attach greater importance to customer satisfaction, launch timeliness, and product return on investment, all of which may be characterized as relating to a higher degree of project newness to the firm. defenders and analyzers, on the other hand, attach more importance than prospectors to measures of unit volume, cost reduction, and margin goals, all of which relate to a lower degree of project newness to the firm. In short, because prospectors seek to introduce new products to new markets, they consider important those measures, which accord with greater product and market newness. The major conclusion of this paper is that strategic type affects the importance of project performance measures and that all firms should not use the same success measures. Firms should contextualize their success in PD projects based on their strategic type. This conclusion resonates with previous findings that strategy is a key determinant of PD success, though it is infrequently included in PD success studies. This paper, therefore, challenges the implicit assumption in the mainstream of PD success literature that success can be determined without regard to firm strategy.","['nanBUSINESS STRATEGY', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'MILES', 'MANAGEMENT', 'VALIDITY', 'FAILURE', 'FIT']",['management'],success performance model
"In afield study of 114 participants, the authors tested components of leader-member exchange (LMX) theory within the context of informal organizational networks, finding support for instrumental components within quality LMX relationships. Similarity to leader competence and personality was relevant to follower-rated LMX. In addition, leader centrality moderated the relationship between interaction frequency and follower-rated LMX. Leader-rated LMX quality was related to personality and competence similarity to followers, but only when followers' advice centrality was high. Outside workgroup centrality positively moderated relationships between inside work-group centrality and LMX quality. Overall, the instrumental value to LMX quality was emphasized more for leaders than for followers.","['advice networks', 'leader-member exchange theory', 'LMX', 'instrumental behavior', 'network analysisMEMBER EXCHANGE', 'STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS', 'POWER', 'MODEL', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'PERSONALITY', 'CENTRALITY', 'CONTEXT', 'GENDER', 'FRENCH']","['lmx', 'personality', 'centrality', 'context']",leader member exchange lmx personality centrality
"In business markets, the long-term nature of relationships may prompt parties to conduct business as usual, but negative critical incidents (CIs) can cause a destabilization of these long-term relationships. The authors develop a comprehensive dynamic model of customer loyalty to account for the impact of negative CIs on both the nature and the magnitude of the relationships between satisfaction and customer share. The results indicate that CIs trigger a stronger updating of the customer relationship, which moves customers from a business-as-usual mind-set to a reconsideration of the relationship. Furthermore, nonlinearities in the relationships are much more pronounced in the presence of CIs. Depending on the relationship quality, CIs have different consequences for customer relationships, and if relationship quality is high, a negative Cl can even have a positive impact on customer share.","['service failure', 'business-to-business relationships', 'customer loyalty', 'services', 'customer relationship management', 'critical incidentsATTRIBUTE-LEVEL PERFORMANCE', 'LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS', 'SERVICE ENCOUNTERS', 'DYNAMIC-MODEL', 'BEHAVIOR', 'LOYALTY', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DETERMINANTS', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'ANTECEDENTS']","['customer loyalty', 'customer loyalty', 'dynamic model', 'dynamic model', 'loyalty', 'consequences']",critical incidents loyalty satisfaction quality
"In this paper we use a comparative perspective to explore the ways in which institutions and networks have influenced entrepreneurial development in Russia. We utilize Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data to study the effects of the weak institutional environment in Russia on entrepreneurship, comparing it first with all available GEM country samples and second, in more detail, with Brazil and Poland. Our results suggest that Russia's institutional environment is important in explaining its relatively low levels of entrepreneurship development, where the latter is measured in terms of both number of start-ups and of existing business owners. In addition, Russia's business environment and its consequences for the role of business networks contribute to the relative advantage of entrepreneurial insiders (those already in business) to entrepreneurial outsiders (newcomers) in terms of new business start-ups.

"A simulation model that formalizes the conventional theory of punctuated organizational change highlights a problem: under a wide range of conditions, organizations appear to fail following reorientation. I propose additions to the theory to account for punctuated transformation. The first adds a routine for monitoring organization-environment consistency; the second is a heuristic that suspends change for a trial period following a reorientation. I show the necessity of the trial period in simulations demonstrating that, while external events may set the pace of organizational change in some environments, under turbulent conditions successful change requires internal pacing, which suspends performance evaluation for a period following a reorientation.(.)","['nanSTRATEGIC CHANGE', 'ADAPTATION', 'EVOLUTION', 'DYNAMICS', 'INERTIA', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'EXPLORATION', 'EQUILIBRIUM', 'CONVERGENCE', 'RATIONALITY']",['transformation'],simulation
"Business groups are a special type of enterprise system existing in almost every market economy. Member firms do not operate as isolated units in the markets but have institutionalized relationships with each other and work coherently as an entity. Groups play a central role in economies in which they operate. For Taiwan, the largest 100 groups produced one third of the GNP in the past 20 years. Why does this organizational form exist in the first place? This paper reviews three relevant theories, market-centred theories, culturalist perspective, and the institutional approach, and employs the data of 150 Taiwanese groups for the answer. The market-centred theories and the institutional arguments are examined statistically and the latter is supported by the data. Following this evidence, the Boolean comparison of group firms with non-group firms confirms that lacking a coherent core in ownership and management makes firms unable to respond to institutional incentives promptly. Finally, the structure of family ownership network in business groups refutes the cultural perspective which argues that the equal inheritance pattern of family property drives entrepreneurs to establish separate firms rather than single hierarchies. While both markets and culture play a distinct part in the story, it is regulatory institutions tl:lat lead to group formation.","['nanEMERGING MARKETS', 'ECONOMY', 'FAMILY']","['economy', 'family']",firms ownership
"This study examines consumers' value co-creation via several shopping channels including a traditional out-of-home shopping channel and smart channels where consumers use a computer, a mobile phone, or social media. It focuses on the effect that value co-creation has on consumers' shopping behavior as well as on the perceived contribution of a shopping channel to their well-being, with a focus on individuals who perceive themselves as being socially excluded, particularly by mobility disability. The project was carried out in the United States using an online survey (n = 1,220). Social exclusion has a positive statistically significant effect on respondents' self-connection with all channels; for many socially excluded respondents the shopping channel has an important role in their lives. Self-connection with the channel has a positive effect on value co-creation and there is a positive relationship between value co-creation and the perceived contribution of the channel on well-being. When consumers help other individuals in their decision making they not only create value for the retailer and for other customers but also contribute positively to their own well-being. Importantly, for smart shopping channels where consumers use a computer or a mobile phone, the effects of value co-creation on the perceived contribution of these channels to consumer well-being are stronger for shoppers with a mobility disability than for those without such a disability.","['Mobility disability', 'multichannel shopping', 'shopping channels', 'smart shopping channels', 'social exclusion', 'value co-creation', 'well-beingCONSUMER-BRAND IDENTIFICATION', 'COMPANY IDENTIFICATION', 'MULTICHANNEL RETAIL', 'HEDONIC VALUE', 'UTILITARIAN', 'SERVICE', 'BEHAVIOR', 'EXPERIENCES', 'CUSTOMERS', 'COMMERCE']","['mobility disability', 'mobility disability', 'shopping channels', 'shopping channels', 'smart shopping channels', 'smart shopping channels', 'smart shopping channels', 'social exclusion', 'social exclusion', 'value co creation', 'value co creation', 'value co creation', 'behavior', 'customers']",consumers value co creation well being mobility disability
"As entrepreneurship emerges into an independent field of study, it is important for scholars and administrators to have a good understanding of the main channels for disseminating knowledge within this field. Here, we provide a new evaluation of journals devoted to entrepreneurship, plus more general journals that publish entrepreneurship articles. The evaluation uses a citation-based model to rate journals. This model overcomes some limitations inherent in the widely known JIFs approach. The model is used to derive ratings that shows the relative influences of established journals that publish research dealing with the entrepreneurship domain. In addition to being a way to gauge the influence that a particular journal has had on this domain, a journal's rating can serve as an early proxy for measuring the influence of individual entrepreneurship articles that have yet to have an opportunity to accumulate citations.","['nanMANAGEMENT JOURNALS', 'CITATION ANALYSIS', 'IMPACT FACTOR', 'BUSINESS', 'SCHOLARS', 'INDEX', 'FORUM', 'PUBLICATION', 'RELIABILITY', 'ECONOMICS']",['scholars'],model
"Twenty years ago, conditional reasoning (CR) was presented as a technology for assessing the implicit aspects of personality. Although this assessment method has been lauded as an advance for organizational scholarship, relatively few CR tests have been developed and validated. We argue that a major impediment to the broader implementation of this technique has been the disproportional emphasis by researchers on measurement-related issues at the expense of better describing the core theoretical processes that underlie CR-namely, justification mechanisms (JMs). In an effort to rectify this problem we (a) explain the differences between implicit and explicit individual differences, (b) introduce the key psychological mechanism associated with these implicit individual differences as conceptualized through CR (JMs), (c) describe how researchers can identify JMs, and (d) discuss how JMs may be measured with CR items. Our work is intended to serve as a catalyst for future CR initiatives by refocusing the attention of researchers on the theoretical underpinnings of CR, thus enabling researchers to build more theoretically sound tests.","['personality', 'individual decision making', 'cognition', 'cognitive processesCONDITIONAL REASONING TEST', 'PERSONALITY', 'EXPLICIT', 'MOTIVATION', 'NEED']","['personality', 'personality', 'explicit']",conditional reasoning implicit personality justification mechanisms individual differences
"Research Summary: We study how internal agglomeration-geographic clustering of business establishments owned by the same parent company-influences establishment productivity. Using Census microdata on the population of U.S. hotels from 1987-2007, we find that doubling the intensity of internal agglomeration is associated with a productivity increase of about 2% in pre-existing establishments. We consider several mechanisms that may be driving the productivity effect and find evidence consistent with the idea that an economically meaningful component of the productivity effect is due to knowledge transfer between internally agglomerated establishments. We replicate our main findings with Census microdata on the full population of U.S. restaurants from 1987-2007, suggesting that the internal agglomeration effects we document may generalize broadly to other industries with multi-unit firms. Managerial Summary: Internal agglomeration is the geographic clustering of business establishments owned by the same parent company. This paper uses detailed Census data on hotels and restaurants to show how internal agglomeration influences performance. Interestingly, knowledge sharing between owned establishments in the same metropolitan area appears to be a key driver of the internal agglomeration effect.","['agglomeration', 'corporate strategy', 'knowledge spillovers', 'productivityCOORDINATION COSTS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'FIRM', 'ACQUISITION', 'SPILLOVERS', 'INVESTMENT', 'INDUSTRY', 'IMPACT', 'CHAIN']","['agglomeration', 'performance', 'firm']",internal agglomeration clustering productivity internal agglomeration knowledge firms metropolitan
"This paper explains the structure of decision rights in franchising networks using property rights theory. Property rights theory explains the allocation of decision rights based on the importance of intangible assets. We submit that franchisees' fraction of decision rights varies positively with the contractibility of local market assets and negatively with contractibility of system-specific assets. Further, franchisees' less contractible innovation assets impact decision rights allocations more than contractible operation assets. Hypotheses tested on data from German franchisors are largely supportive. We extend the franchise literature by arguing that the contractibility of local market assets impacts the allocation of decision rights, and that decision rights allocations change for decisions involving different areas of the value chain.","['nanKNOW-HOW', 'PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'MANAGEMENT CONTROL', 'BARGAINING POWER', 'OWNERSHIP', 'AUTHORITY', 'MARKET', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'ANTECEDENTS']",['market'],decision rights franchising networks property rights theory assets value chain
"Innovation is central to the survival and growth of firms, and ultimately to the health of the economies of which they are part. A clear understanding both of the processes by which firms perform innovation and the benefits which flow from innovation in terms of productivity and growth is therefore essential. This paper demonstrates the use of a conceptual framework and modeling tool, the innovation value chain (IVC), and shows how the IVC approach helps to highlight strengths and weaknesses in the innovation performance of a key group of firmsnew technology-based firms. The value of the IVC is demonstrated in showing the key interrelationships in the whole process of innovation from sourcing knowledge through product and process innovation to performance in terms of the growth and productivity outcomes of different types of innovation. The use of the IVC highlights key complementarities, such as that between internal R&D, external R&D, and other external sources of knowledge. Other important relationships are also highlighted. Skill resources matter throughout the IVC, being positively associated with external knowledge linkages and innovation success, and also having a direct influence on growth independent of the effect on innovation. A key benefit of the IVC approach is therefore its ability to highlight the roles of different factors at various stages of the knowledgeinnovationperformance nexus, and to show their indirect as well as direct impact. This in turn permits both managerial and policy implications to be drawn.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'EXPORT-MARKET PARTICIPATION', 'COMMON METHOD VARIANCE', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'VENTURE STRATEGIES', 'EXTERNAL LINKAGES', 'ACADEMIC RESEARCH', 'PERFORMANCE', 'KNOWLEDGE']","['performance', 'knowledge']",knowledge
"The study sought to investigate the impact of the contextual variables of decentralization and environmental uncertainty on the strategic usefulness of management information as perceived by middle managers of an overseas subsidiary of a large, diversified multinational corporation. Management information was expressed in terms of the characteristics of aggregation, scope, and timeliness. Factor analysis was used to verify these dimensions. Data were collected through the use of a questionnaire. Three hypothesized relationships between the contextual variables and the information characteristics were tested through multiple regression analysis. The results indicated that there was a significant relationship between the management information characteristics and perceived environmental uncertainty. Two of the information characteristics-scope and timeliness-showed no significant relationship with decentralization. Aggregation of information, however, only showed a relationship with decentralization through the interaction of environmental uncertainty and decentralization.

Because of its importance to management and lack of attention in the marketing literature, specific emphasis is placed on the phenomenon of noncomplaining and the role of consumer emotion in dissatisfying marketplace experiences. The model presents cognitive appraisal as the key element in the evaluation of consumer threat and harm, which subsequently may result in psychological stress. Stressful appraisal outcomes are suggested to elicit emotive reactions that, in conjunction with cognitive appraisal, influence the type of coping strategy used by the consumer Three coping strategies (problem focused, emotion focused, and avoidance) are identified and discussed.

"We argue that the pressure MNE subsidiaries face to engage in corrupt practices in their host country varies positively with the institutionalization of corrupt practices in both host and home country environments. We further argue that the relationship between an MNE's home country environment and the pressure it faces in the host country is moderated by its localization strategy. Results suggest a positive relationship between the host country corruption environment and the pressure subsidiaries face to engage in bribery locally. Mixed results emerged concerning MNEs from home countries participating in the OECD Convention for Combating Bribery. Results concerning the impact of the home country corruption environment are best viewed in light of significant moderating effects. When MNEs did not have local partners, firms from less corrupt home countries reported less pressure to engage in corrupt practices locally; however, the presence of local partners eliminated this relationship. Results will help managers understand the pressures their firm is likely to face when operating in corrupt host country environments, and also offer guidance concerning how the firm might reduce its exposure to those local institutional pressures.

"This study uses network data of worker behavior to analyze changes in worker communication patterns during the first three years post-acquisition. The findings suggest that new communication routines develop slowly and are not entirely enduring even when a transformative event, such as an acquisition, occurs. Communication across firms initially increases as workers change their routines. However, over time this communication peaks and then falls as workers develop common ground. Communication across firms was greater when workers' tasks were interdependent. Overall, this study demonstrates that communication routines persist even after an organizationally transforming event. It illustrates the importance of both the formal and informal organization as well as the promise of using social network methods and communication log data to study social phenomena of strategic interest.

"Product platforms have become a principal fundament and a prerequisite for pro. table product development in almost every industry today. Since platforms have a desirable potential to reduce development and production costs, there is an extensive bulk of knowledge describing underlying platform principles and challenges. But the vast majority of the identified challenges are based on single firms and brand contexts, which imply that previous findings might not be applicable when platform development involves several brands, here called multibranded platforms. In the present article it is therefore suggested that there is lack of knowledge describing managerial challenges of multibranded platform development. To be able to capture such a strategy that holds certain complexity and unknown dimension, an explorative and longitudinal field study is supposed to achieve the. nest insights into a yet incompletely documented phenomenon. Because of the field-study approach, findings from the study are theoretically validated in relation to existing knowledge from other contributions. To start developing a multibranded product platform development framework, the present study identifies three distinctively different strategic forces that must be handled in such multibranded platform development: ( 1) the creation of a common architecture; ( 2) accomplishing product differentiation within an expanded and multibranded product scope; and ( 3) corporate responsibility in the transition from single- branded to multibranded platform development. Three dimensions of managerial challenges are identified. The first is technology management challenges, which deal with commonalization in terms of the development of common multibranded architectures. The major challenge to achieve architectural commonalization is that no individuals from any brand have the proper multibranded architectural knowledge. Instead, multibranded architectures must evolve from the beginning and be founded on a new and expanded brand scope. Architectural commonalization also includes elements of unlearning since previous experiences have little relevance. The second challenge is brand management challenges and deals with brand differentiation in terms of portfolio management. Differentiation is an effect of increased diversification that particularly challenges brands of opposite generic competitive strategies. The third challenge dimension is called corporate management challenges and deals with the combination of the two others. From a corporate management perspective, it seems important to provide new organizational structures that support and combine interests of technology and brand management. Finally, multibranded platform development is a corporate strategy that affects business units and functional units thoroughly.","['nanPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'ARCHITECTURES', 'ACQUISITIONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'FIRMS']","['architectures', 'firms']",knowledge technology management
"This article examines the franchisor-franchisee relationship from two theoretical perspectives - agency theory and exchange theory. Taking the case of the fast-food industry in Israel, the research focuses on control and autonomy in a domestic hamburger chain - Burger Ranch - and two international chains - McDonald's and Burger King. The findings led to the design of a model that illustrates several aspects, such as the concept of franchising, the size and age of the chain, and the range of the contract, that relate to control and autonomy. The combination of agency theory and exchange theory enables us to focus on control and autonomy as multidimensional concepts, and to present various possibilities for judiciously balancing them. The case indicates that in some respects (e.g. master franchisee), the two global chains are more similar to each other than to the domestic chain. However, in other respects (e.g. size, growth rate), the domestic and one of the two global chains show more similarities than differences. The findings indicate different forms of integration of control and autonomy in the three chains.","['agency theory', 'autonomy', 'control', 'exchange theory', 'fast-food', 'franchisingAGENCY THEORY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL FORM', 'CONTRACTS', 'SURVIVAL', 'EXCHANGE', 'MARKET', 'GROWTH', 'ENTREPRENEURS', 'EXPLANATIONS', 'ARRANGEMENTS']","['agency theory', 'agency theory', 'autonomy', 'control', 'exchange theory', 'exchange theory', 'fast food', 'fast food', 'exchange', 'growth']",agency theory
"Many of the most pivotal mechanisms of team success are emergent phenomenaconstructs with conceptual origins at the individual level that coalesce over time through members' interactions to characterize a team as a whole. Typically, empirical research on teams represents emergent mechanisms as the aggregate of members' self-report perceptions of the team. This dominant approach assumes members have developed a perception of the emergent property and are able to respond accurately to survey items. Yet emergent phenomena require sufficient time and team interaction before coalescing as perceptible team properties. Attempting to measure an emergent property before it is perceptible can result in inaccurate assessments and substantive conclusions. Therefore, a key purpose of this study is to develop a better understanding of the underlying characteristics of emergent team phenomena that give rise to their emergence as perceptible and, thus, accurately measurable team characteristics. We advance a conceptual framework that classifies emergent team properties on the basis of the degree to which the construct manifests in overtly observable behaviors, positing that more observable emergent team phenomena require less interaction before emerging as ratable team properties compared to constructs that are less easily observed. Leveraging advances in measurement modeling, we test our conceptual framework in a laboratory sample and a quasi-field study sample, demonstrating a multilevel measurement approach that evaluates the emergence of shared team properties across measurement occasions. Results suggest the observability of emergent team properties is a crucial determinant of the relative speed at which constructs emerge as recognizable, ratable properties of the team.","['teams', 'emergence', 'processes', 'emergent states', 'item response theoryITEM RESPONSE THEORY', 'TRANSACTIVE MEMORY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODELS', 'CONSTRUCTS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'FRAMEWORK', 'COGNITION', 'DYNAMICS', 'COHESION']","['teams', 'emergence', 'constructs', 'framework']",research perceptions

The authors integrate the entrepreneurship literature's sociological and behavioural perspectives and examine the processes through which entrepreneurs first build social networks and then use the network resources for enhancing venture performance. Field interviews of entrepreneurs during a six-month period reveal that political skill is an important individual-level factor that influences the construction and use of social networks. Theoretical and practical implications of the major findings are discussed.,"['entrepreneurship', 'political skill', 'social capital', 'venture performanceTIE-FORMATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'OPPORTUNITIES', 'INFORMATION', 'PERSONALITY', 'COMPETENCE', 'ACTIVATION', 'STRATEGIES', 'MOTIVATION', 'REPUTATION']","['entrepreneurship', 'political skill', 'political skill', 'performance']",networks political skill
"Size labels adopted by food vendors can have a major impact on size judgments and consumption. In forming size judgments, consumers integrate the actual size information from the stimuli with the semantic cue from the size label. Size labels influence not only size perception and actual consumption, they also affect perceived consumption. Size labels can also result in relative perceived size reversals, so that consumers deem a smaller package to be bigger than a larger one. Further, consumers are more likely to believe a label that professes an item to be smaller (vs. larger) in the size range associated with that item. This asymmetric effect of size labels can result in larger consumption without the consumer even being aware of it (guiltless gluttony).","['nanEXPANDING PORTION SIZES', 'PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT', 'INFORMATION', 'OBESITY', 'DETERMINANT', 'ACTIVATION', 'PERSUASION', 'AWARENESS', 'RESPONSES', 'USAGE']",['information'],size judgments guiltless gluttony
"The authors analyze data from two cross-national studies to explore differences in organizational buyers' normative expectations of supplier performance. These normative expectations encompass what buyers perceive as business standards or norms, regardless of product/service, supplier, or industry The first study (four countries) pinpoints the normative expectations that help explain why managers across countries may, evaluate the same supplier performance differently. The second study provides an illustrative example of these differences in a separate sample drawn from the same four countries. The inclusion of such normative expectations of supplier performance has the potential to add explanatory power to models of performance evaluation in international business-to-business relationships. The findings suggest that if differences in normative expectations of supplier performance are not taken into account, performance ratings may be distorted indicators of actual performance.","['normative expectations', 'business-to-business services', 'supplier performance', 'national differences', 'organizational buying behaviorCUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'SERVICE QUALITY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'CULTURE', 'MODEL', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERSPECTIVES', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'COMPLEXITY', 'EXPERIENCE']","['normative expectations', 'normative expectations', 'supplier performance', 'supplier performance', 'model']",models ratings
"Existing research on executives' belief in the business case for corporate social responsibility (CSR) is built on two premises. The first is that, in order to believe in the business case, executives need factual evidence that this business case indeed exists. The second premise is that those executives who do believe in the business case will readily invest in CSR-related activities. The results from our four studies tell a different story. We show that managers, rather than focusing on factual evidence, believe in the business case because they espouse a fair market ideology-the tendency to justify and idealize the market economy system. At the same time, even though managers espousing a fair market ideology believe in the business case for CSR, they are not more inclined to engage in CSR than managers who do not hold such an ideology, because they also experience weaker moral emotions when confronted with ethical problems. By drawing on system justification theory, we simultaneously explore antecedents and consequences of executives' belief in the business case for CSR and of their moral emotions. In doing so, we help advance knowledge about the micro-foundations of CSR.","['nanCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'SYSTEM-JUSTIFICATION', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'STATUS-QUO', 'CEO CHARACTERISTICS', 'ETHICAL LEADERSHIP', 'SUSTAINABILITY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'FUTURE']","['system justification', 'system justification']",business corporate social responsibility system justification micro foundations
"The authors investigate how perceived customer value can be translated into economic returns for online social network sites (SNS). The (joint) impact of two value propositions, social capital and entitativity, is assessed. Perceived economic and social customer value are investigated as outcomes of these propositions. Two studies reveal that entitativity and social capital impact members' willingness to pay (WtP) membership fees, either directly or indirectly. Moreover, the predictive ability of perceived economic and social customer value regarding WtP depends on the type of membership and the type of social network. SNS providers are advised to emphasize the benefits their users actually take advantage of. While for professional SNS, it seems advisable to stress both social and economic value, particularly for premium members, in socially oriented SNS premium members seem to be driven more by social value. Other theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.","['entitativity', 'online social networks', 'social capital', 'upselling', 'willingess to payINGROUP IDENTIFICATION', 'VIRTUAL COMMUNITIES', 'ENTITATIVITY', 'MODEL', 'PARTICIPATION', 'RETENTION', 'IDENTITY', 'BUSINESS', 'MEMBERS']","['entitativity', 'social capital', 'social capital', 'entitativity', 'members']",perceived customer value online social network sites entitativity
"This paper studies how firms use acquisitions to achieve long-term business reconfiguration. We base the study in a routine-based perspective on business dynamics. We develop and test hypotheses concerning the relative extent of change by acquiring and non-acquiring businesses, focusing art product line addition, retention, and deletion as forms of changing resources. We develop and test hypotheses that compare and contrast resource-deepening and resource extension arguments. We test the hypotheses with data from more than 3000 firms that offered more than 200 product lines in the U.S. medical sector between 1978 and 1995. We find that acquisitions play a major role in business reconfiguration, offering opportunities for firms to both build on existing resources and obtain substantially different resources.

Results generally supported a model that links perceptions of justice-based attributes (adequacy of outplacement help; consistency, objectivity, and ethicality of procedures) with affective commitment and intentions to leave. We also considered the main and moderating effects of a particular voluntary severance outcome, eligibility. Eligibility was associated with both commitment and turnover intentions, and moderated the effect of perceived adequacy of outplacement help on turnover intentions, as well as the effect of perceived procedural fairness on commitment. Control variables representing demographics (age), perceived fairness of a previous early retirement program, and anticipation of future layoffs also significantly influenced both outcomes.

"This study examines the joint effects of diversity composition (as manifested in faultline strength) and diversity management (as manifested in diversity climate) on loyal behavior. Using data gathered from a sample of 1,652 managerial employees in 76 work units, we assess the cross-level effects of unit-level relationship-and task-related faultline strength and diversity climate on individual-level loyal behavior of managerial employees. We find a negative relationship between gender faultline strength and loyal behavior, and a positive relationship between diversity climate and loyal behavior. In addition, we find that work unit diversity climate moderates the relationships between the strength of gender and function faultlines and loyal behavior; specifically, a supportive diversity climate reduces the negative consequences associated with relationship-related faultlines and increases the positive consequences associated with task-related faultlines. The results highlight the value of simultaneously considering faultlines and diversity climate in understanding and managing workforce diversity.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY THEORY', 'CONTEXTUAL PERFORMANCE', 'DEMOGRAPHIC FAULTLINES', 'VALUING DIVERSITY', 'TASK-PERFORMANCE', 'WORK', 'TEAM', 'SUBGROUPS', 'EMPLOYEE']","['work', 'employee']",gender

Since independents emphasize the traitedness of behavior and tend to focus on attributes of objects, brand beliefs are relatively more accessible than exemplars to them. Conversely, since interdependents focus more on the role of contextual factors and the interrelatedness of events, exemplars are relatively more accessible to them than brand beliefs.

"Advances in information technology have led to a substantial increase in the use of interactive pricing mechanisms, where buyers (i.e., consumers) and sellers (i.e., retailers) enter a formal computer-mediated price-negotiation process during which consumers submit bids for a specific product. This article examines how the interface used for bid elicitation affects bidding behavior and, ultimately, retailer profit. Our focus is on one key aspect of the bid-elicitation interface how retailers require bidders to articulate their bids. Evidence from four experiments involving economically consequential bids demonstrates that the candidate bid amounts specified by the retailer have a strong influence on bidding behavior, and consequently also on retailer profit. In particular, the level of candidate bid amounts has a positive effect on actual bid amounts, whereas it has a negative impact on the likelihood that a consumer will actually submit a bid. Critically, we show that the former effect can more than offset the latter to cause an increase in retailer profit. We propose and find support for two distinct pathways driving this phenomenon the candidate bid amounts (I) influence bidders' valuations of the offered product and (2) shape bidders' beliefs about what bid amounts will be successful. Our results highlight the importance of the design of user interfaces for interactive pricing, demonstrating that even seemingly innocuous aspects of interfaces can have a dramatic impact on bidding behavior and retailer profit. 2011 New York University.

"Construal level theory indicates that consumers tend to prefer products high in desirability (greater functionality) for distant-future decisions but switch their preferences toward products high in feasibility (greater usage convenience) for near-future decisions. The current research demonstrates that price information, traditionally considered as a feasibility cue, can increase consumers' near-future preference toward products with greater functionality despite their low convenience, leading to preference consistency over time. As the underlying mechanism, price information increases the functionality importance for near-future decisions due to consumers' enhanced value-seeking tendency when seeing price and their lay belief that greater functionality represents higher value. Further, when consumers are led to believe that greater convenience represents higher value, price and the value-seeking tendency result in a greater preference toward easy-to-use products for the distant future and lead to preference consistency across time as well. Theoretical implications are discussed.","['nanSELF-CONTROL', 'MONEY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'INCONSISTENCY', 'INTENTIONS', 'ATTRIBUTES', 'CONSUMERS', 'DISTANCE', 'ACCOUNT', 'SEARCH']","['consumers', 'search']",construal level theory preference consistency time value seeking discussed
"Organizational social capital (OSC), the goodwill and resources companies gain from their relationships with other companies, enables family firms to assemble the resources (especially knowledge) necessary for successful adaptation. Connecting with new ventures, the vanguard of radical change, is a priority for family firms seeking to achieve survival, profitability and growth. Yet, new ventures are often not well known and their networks are poorly structured, making access to them difficult. Using the relational perspectives on interorganizational relationships, this study proposes that family firms can employ their OSC to reach new ventures. Family firms can invest in these ventures, build profitable business relationships and alliances with them, as well as assist in governing their operations. Data from 779 companies show that family firms are in better positions to harvest their large OSC stocks to connect with new ventures. The results underscore the value of OSC as an important relational resource for family firms.","['nanMANAGEMENT', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'OPPORTUNITIES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'GOVERNANCE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'RESOURCES', 'ALLIANCES', 'CREATION', 'STRATEGY']","['resources', 'alliances']",organizational social capital family firms new ventures networks
"Most multichannel retailers offer larger assortment in their online channel than in the offline channels. Conventional belief holds that larger assortment leads to more sales. However, offering more products could also cannibalize the sales of the retailer's main product offerings, hence reducing efficiency in assortment management and increasing cost. Recent behavioral research suggests that excessive assortment can lead to customer cognitive overload and deter them from purchasing. In this paper, we investigate the effect of large online assortment on customer spending. We empirically estimate the effect of large online assortment by exploiting the natural experiment of channel migration, which allows us to compare the spending of customers who migrated to the retailer's online channel with that of a holdout group of pure catalog shoppers. We find that online customers outspend those catalog shoppers by 10.7 percent on the retailer's mainline products. We provide evidence that the increased spending by online customers is due to lower product search cost in the online channel. Lastly, our research suggests that the online sales of low-volume niche products can be an important source of revenue for the retailer. (C) 2016 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Subsequently, Me performed a regression analysis to examine the residual group effect after controlling for both environment and firm-specific effects.

"Recent development of an institution-based theory of corporate diversification has uncovered a diversification premium in emerging economies, suggesting that some business group-affiliated companies may outperform competing firms not affiliated with business groups. Is the diversification premium found in emerging economies likely to hold over time? This article extends the institution-based theory by arguing that as institutional transitions unfold, diversification premium in emerging economies is likely to dissipate over time and eventually become a diversification discount. We empirically draw on a data set from South Korea between 1984 and 1996 involving 84 business groups and 751 group-affiliated and independent firms to substantiate this claim via a chop shop method. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first study that documents the longitudinal process of how a diversification premium becomes a diversification discount during institutional transitions.

"Research on the determinants and effects of various governance mechanisms typically assumes that these mechanisms operate independently. However, since a variety of mechanisms are used to achieve alignment of the interests of shareholders and managers, we propose that the level of a particular mechanism should be influenced by the levels of other mechanisms which simultaneously operate in the firm. We examine the substitution effects between alternative internal governance mechanisms for a sample of 81 bank holding companies in the postderegulation period. Specifically, we consider the relationship between monitoring by outside directors and the following mechanisms: monitoring by large outside shareholders, mutual monitoring by inside directors, and incentive effects of shareholdings by managers. Our results provide evidence consistent with the substitution hypothesis.

"Foreign investors generally need to overcome a liability of foreignness stemming from contextual distance between their home country and the target country. We argue that they can limit that liability more easily by investing in a global city rather than elsewhere in the target country. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the contextual distance to a target country has a positive effect on a firm's propensity to invest in a global city in that country. We also predict that this effect is stronger for investments in knowledge-intensive activities and weaker for investors with more target-country experience in general and target-country experience in global cities in particular. Our hypotheses receive considerable support in an analysis of 11,748 foreign greenfield investments by 1025 manufacturing and service firms during 2008-2012. Our findings suggest that global cities are superior subnational locations for gathering contextual knowledge about target countries and limiting the liability of foreignness.","['Contextual distance', 'Global cities', 'Knowledge-intensive activities', 'Liability of foreignness', 'Location decisions', 'Target-country experienceRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'JAPANESE MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'CULTURAL DISTANCE', 'INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE', 'HOST-COUNTRY', 'CHOICE', 'ENTRY', 'IMPACT', 'CITY', 'HEADQUARTERS']","['contextual distance', 'contextual distance', 'global cities', 'global cities', 'knowledge intensive activities', 'knowledge intensive activities', 'knowledge intensive activities', 'liability of foreignness', 'liability of foreignness', 'liability of foreignness', 'city']",liability of foreignness greenfield investments firms
"In stigmatized industries characterized by social contestation, hostile audiences, and distancing between industry insiders and outsiders, firms facing media attacks follow different strategies from firms in uncontested industries. Because firms avoid publicizing their tainted-sector membership, when threatened, they can respond by divesting assets from that industry. Our analyses of the arms industry demonstrate that media attacks on the focal firm and its peers both increase the likelihood of divestment for the focal firm. Specifically, attacks on the focal firm are the most consequential, followed by attacks on peers in the same industry subcategory, and by attacks on peers in different subcategories. These findings shed new light on divestment as a response to media attacks in stigmatized industries and lead us to rethink impression management theory.

"Understanding the receiving side of creativity has both scientific and practical value. Creativity can add value to organizations after it is perceived, evaluated, and eventually adopted. In this paper, we review four decades of empirical research on the receiving side of creativity scattered across several business and social science fields. A comprehensive framework surfaces out of our review, indicating four groups of factors affecting the evaluation and adoption of creativity, namely, characteristics of target, creator, perceiver, and context. Although the receiving side of creativity has received far less attention than the generative side in management literature, vibrant research efforts in other scientific fields have built a solid foundation to understand creativity receiving in the workplace. We call for more studies on this important topic and discuss how future research could contribute to its development by advancing conceptual clarity, methodological precision, and integration between theories, disciplines, and different sides of the creative process.","['creativity receiving', 'creativity evaluation', 'creativity recognition', 'target', 'creator', 'perceiver', 'contextVENTURE CAPITALISTS EVALUATIONS', 'PERCEIVED PRODUCT CREATIVITY', 'IMPLICIT THEORIES', 'IDEA GENERATION', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'OPPORTUNITY EVALUATION', 'INDIVIDUAL CREATIVITY', 'REGULATORY FOCUS', 'PRIOR KNOWLEDGE', 'BRAND NAMES']","['creativity receiving', 'creativity receiving', 'target', 'creator', 'perceiver']",creativity context creative process
"Whether or not to adopt and how extensively to use a newly legitimized practice are discrete decisions made by firms undergoing institutional change. The aim of this paper is to identify the distinct effects of economic, social, and political factors on the adoption of performance-related pay practices and their coverage (i.e. the proportion of employees covered by the practices) by integrating institutional and agency theories. An empirical analysis is performed with a unique sample of Korean firms that experienced the East Asian financial crisis of 1997. The results show that while performance-related pay adoption was influenced by economic and social factors, performance-related pay coverage was related to political factors as well as economic and social factors. This finding suggests that while firms adopt performance-related pay practices in search of legitimacy, they do not blindly imitate such practices but rather proactively adapt them based on economic efficiency considerations. This study makes valuable contributions to research on institutionalism and remuneration by empirically identifying the conditions under which a pay practice adopted for social legitimacy fits or fails to fit the economic needs of the adopters.","['nanHUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'FORMAL-STRUCTURE', 'RISK', 'DETERMINANTS', 'IMPACT', 'FIRMS', 'DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION', 'GLOBALIZATION']",['firms'],legitimacy remuneration
"In response to traditional approaches' limited success in explaining voluntary turnover, we explored a paradigmatic shift in turnover research. Using a large national sample, we found we could more successfully model voluntary turnover by recognizing that job (dis)satisfaction and ease of movement importance depend on the group of leavers being studied. For example, ongoing job satisfaction had smaller effects for turnover driven by certain shocks (unsolicited job offers and family-related reasons), which accounted for 40 percent of all quits. Moreover, the prevalence of unsolicited job offers may necessitate rethinking the role of ease of movement in turnover decisions.","['nanEMPLOYEE TURNOVER', 'UNFOLDING MODEL', 'SURVIVAL ANALYSIS', 'SEX-DIFFERENCES', 'QUIT RATES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'REGRESSION', 'SEARCH', 'METAANALYSIS', 'CONCEPTUALIZATIONS']",['search'],decisions
"Does consistency between how a firm treats employees (what it does) and its espoused employee-oriented values (what it says) affect employee productivity? Furthermore, given that the stakeholder theory perspective holds that what happens to one stakeholder influences other stakeholders, does this sort of consistency vis-a-vis a firm's customers also influence employee productivity? We empirically investigate the influence of organizational authenticity-defined as consistency between a firm's espoused values and realized practices-in the context of a merger, and specifically during post-merger integration. Our findings show that a lack of organizational authenticity in terms of both under-promising and over-promising to both employees and customers is associated with lower productivity, which in turn is related to long-term merger performance, thus affecting outcomes for shareholders. These findings support the importance of authenticity and should therefore be of interest to executives responsible for ensuring the consistency between what a firm says and what it does, as well as those who participate in and study the merger integration process. In particular, we propose stakeholder theory as a helpful lens for examining the merger integration process as well as other joint actions such as strategic alliances.","['nanACQUISITION INTEGRATION', 'MANAGEMENT RESEARCH', 'TRUST', 'DETERMINANTS', 'RECIPROCITY', 'VALUES', 'SATISFACTION', 'METAANALYSIS', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'OPPORTUNISM']",['values'],values productivity stakeholder theory organizational authenticity alliances

"For a new leader, the process of entering and establishing a position of leadership in a complex organization presents a major challenge. This challenge seems particularly acute when authority, goals and technology are ambiguous, as in many professional service organizations. In this paper, we integrate ideas from the literature on socialization and role theory as well as that on executive succession processes to view new leader integration as a mutual adjustment process between two trajectories - that of the organization and that of the new leader. It is argued that this may lead to four possible types of integration outcomes: assimilation, transformation, accommodation and parallelism. Drawing on a case study of a large hospital, the paper identifies several mechanisms that can be mobilized by the new leader to enhance his or her room for manoeuvre as the integration process evolves. The mechanisms can be classified as collaborative or affirmative, with each type having different risks and advantages. The case analysis further reveals that leader integration processes may be differentiated between different activity domains, dynamic over time las the use of one type of integration approach alters the potential for another later), and interactive across different activity domains las events in one part of the organization have consequences for those occurring in another).","['nanEXECUTIVE SUCCESSION', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'TOP MANAGERS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SOCIALIZATION', 'OUTCOMES', 'SYSTEMS']","['socialization', 'outcomes']",organizations executive succession

"Category management (CM) is a recent retail management initiative that aims at improving a retailer's overall performance in a product category through more coordinated buying, merchandising, and pricing of the brands in the category than in the past. Despite tremendous retailer and manufacturer interest in the process of CM and its rapid adoption in the industry, much uncertainty exists about the consequences of CM for channel members. The present study focuses on how a shift to CM by a retailer affects its equilibrium prices, sales, and profitability in a competitive retail setting. On the basis of an analysis of a model of two competing national brand manufacturers that supply two competing common retailers, the authors find that one retailer's adoption of CM increases its average unit price of the category and reduces its sales volume and revenues. However, this retailer can still enjoy an increase in its gross margin profits as competing manufacturers' wholesale prices fall in the process. Also, the CM adopter's profits are greater than those of a symmetric competing retailer that follows the traditional brand-centered management of a product category when the interbrand competition is high but interstore competition is low. Applying the intervention analysis methodology, the authors empirically test several of these analytical findings, employing a unique data set that contains information about a supermarket chain's weekly average unit prices and sales of the laundry detergent category before and after this product category was moved to CM by the retailer. The propositions that adoption of CM will lead to higher retail prices and lower sales are upheld in this empirical study. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for practitioners and researchers, the limitations of the study, and directions for further research.","['nanINTERVENTION ANALYSIS', 'COMMON RETAILER', 'CHANNEL', 'COMPETITION']","['common retailer', 'common retailer', 'channel', 'competition']",category management

Thus, we argue that family firms sacrifice IPO proceeds by choosing higher IPO underpricing than nonfamily firms if underpricing helps them protect their SEW.

"This paper provides a contemporary and comprehensive review of work in the marketing channel field that is based on French and Raven's power-base theory. It traces the development of theoretic, conceptual and methodological orthodoxies from the 1970s. Mirroring the movement towards the relationship marketing paradigm, the paper considers the theory's empirical contribution to knowledge of power, conflict, trust and commitment in marketing channels. Limitations relating to inconsistency of treatment, contradictory findings and the simplification of complex phenomena are identified. Nevertheless, current work extends power-base theory to other cultures, other styles of research and to the area of supply chains. The review raises questions about the value of contribution made using this theory and notes the surprising absence within the channels literature of the broader, current debate about power. To illustrate, the paper shows how Clegg's (1989. Frameworks of Power. London: Sage) circuits of power framework, if applied to channel contexts, could address forms of power that are invisible, anonymous and not necessarily negative. Applications and methods are discussed, opening a space wherein a broadened understanding of power is integrated within a focus upon cooperative channels.","['nanINFLUENCE STRATEGIES', 'INTERFIRM POWER', 'RELATIONSHIP COMMITMENT', 'CONFLICT', 'SATISFACTION', 'SUPPLIER', 'IMPACT', 'MANAGEMENT', 'DEPENDENCE', 'EXERCISE']",['conflict'],trust commitment chains
"By integrating results from literature pertaining to social psychology, organizational behavior, and relationship marketing, the authors develop and test a model that explains how value congruence affects the key components of consumer-brand relationship quality and outcomes, including satisfaction, trust, affective commitment, and loyalty. Using structural equation modeling, they test the model with data from a survey of 1,037 consumers of clothing stores and banks in the Netherlands.

"The resource-depleting effect of surface acting is well established. Yet we know less about the pervasiveness of this depleting effect and what employees can do at work to replenish their resources. Drawing on conservation of resources theory and the ecological congruence model, we conduct a five-day diary study among customer service representatives (CSRs) to examine the extended depleting effect of surface acting and whether social interactions with coworkers (i.e., giving and receiving help) can mitigate the negative consequences of emotional labor. Momentary reports from 102 CSRs indicate that within-person daily surface acting positively predicted end-of-day emotional exhaustion, and the effect of emotional exhaustion spilled over to work engagement the following day. Analyzing the within-person moderating effects of giving and receiving help at work, we find that giving help buffered the depletion process while receiving help did not. We discuss the theoretical and practical significance of considering the temporality of the resource-depleting effects of surface acting, the role of at-work help giving in buffering the negative effect of emotional labor that could affect the sense of self, and the importance of resource congruence in influencing the efficacy of buffering effects.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'EMOTIONAL LABOR', 'JOB-SATISFACTION', 'WORK ENGAGEMENT', 'SOCIAL SUPPORT', 'MULTILEVEL MEDIATION', 'PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR', 'COWORKER SUPPORT', 'RESOURCES THEORY', 'SELF-REGULATION']","['emotional labor', 'emotional labor', 'work engagement', 'work engagement', 'resources theory', 'resources theory']",congruence service emotional labor
"Because partners may behave opportunistically in alliances, contractual safeguards or trust between partners are necessary for successful outcomes. However, it remains controversial whether safeguards and trust substitute or complement each other. Drawing on transaction cost theory, this study conceptualizes both contractual safeguards and trust as important control mechanisms in non-equity alliances, and develops a model that relates contractual safeguards and trust to cooperative outcomes. We test our hypotheses with data collected from 233 architect-contractor partnerships in Hong Kong. The results show that the relationship between contractual safeguards and cooperative outcomes depends on both the level and type of trust. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

"While joint ethical violations are fairly common in the marketplace and in workplace, sports-team, and academic settings, little research has studied such collaborative wrongdoings. This work compares the joint ethical decisions of pairs of people (i.e., dyads) to those of individual decision makers. Four experiments demonstrate that dyads in which the partners do not share a social bond with each other behave less ethically than individuals do. The authors propose that this effect occurs because joint ethical violations offer a means to socially bond with others. Consistent with this theory, they demonstrate that the dyads' subethicality relative to individuals is attenuated (1) if the dyad partners establish rapport prior to the joint decision making, and (2) in decision-making contexts in which social bonding goals are less active-namely, making a decision with an outgroup versus in-group member. Taken together, this research provides novel theoretical insights into the social aspects of unethical behavior, offers suggestions to improve ethicality in joint decisions, and raises important questions for future research.","['unethical decisions', 'cheating', 'ethical', 'dyads', 'joint decision making', 'social bondingSELF-CONTROL DECISIONS', 'CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS', 'UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR', 'SOCIAL EXCLUSION', 'MORAL IDENTITY', 'GOAL PURSUIT', 'ACCOUNTABILITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'DISHONESTY', 'STANDARDS']","['ethical', 'dyads', 'joint decision making', 'joint decision making', 'joint decision making', 'unethical behavior', 'unethical behavior']",wrongdoings rapport unethical behavior
"Although Chinese manufacturers are considered as latecomers or followers in global commodity chains, they have also been experiencing rapid progress in upgrading performance from own equipment manufacturing (OEM), original design manufacturing (ODM) to own brand manufacturing (OBM). Current literature on the global commodity chain has focused primarily on economic conditions that help explain manufacture upgrade while giving limited attention to what marketing capabilities support and sustain firm competitiveness through upgrading. This article examines eight different marketing capabilities to assess influence on manufacture upgrade performance. A survey of electronics manufacturers in mainland China and Hong Kong shows the significance of individual marketing capabilities and implications of their interdependency for manufacture upgrade performance. In particular, product development, marketing communication and channel management capabilities are crucial for manufacture upgrade. The results also highlight the importance of selective marketing capability development and the potential of secondary support for the relationship between substantive and dynamic capabilities.

"Family firms must attract talented employees to stay competitive. They have different employer characteristics than nonfamily firms. For example, although they generally offer lower wages, they also typically offer higher job security and a more cooperative and entrepreneurial work environment. However, drawing on occupational choice theory, we argue that the importance of these unique family firm characteristics depends on the national labor market context in which the family firm is embedded. A multilevel investigation of 12,746 individuals in 40 countries shows that individuals prefer to work in family firms in labor markets with flexible unregulated hiring and firing practices, centralized wage determination, and low labor-employer cooperation. A cross-level analysis further shows that the national labor market context moderates the effects of individual-level factors determining the preference to work in a family firm (e.g., entrepreneurship intention). Our article is the first to consider labor market institutions in research on family firms as employers. Practical implications exist for family firms regarding their employer branding and intrapreneurship strategies.","['family firms', 'occupational choice', 'employer branding', 'cross-country study', 'labor market institutionsEMPLOYMENT PROTECTION', 'BARGAINING REGIME', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'OWNERSHIP', 'STEWARDSHIP', 'MANAGEMENT', 'IMPACT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETITIVENESS', 'PARTICIPATION']","['family firms', 'family firms', 'occupational choice', 'occupational choice', 'employer branding', 'employer branding', 'entrepreneurship']",firm

"Recently, capturing within-organization variability during the implementation of high performance work systems (HPWS) has received considerable attention; however, the source of such variability has rarely been considered. If the utilization of HPWS is positively related to performance outcomes, examining factors contributing to an effective implementation may yield significant theoretical and practical implications. For this purpose, this study extends the extant HPWS literature in two ways. First, we attempt to conceptualize team-level HPWS intensity and identify antecedents of variance across teams. Specifically, we regard the visible role of team managers in the process of HPWS implementation as a primary interpretive filter that makes team members perceive differences in HPWS intensity, which in turn affects team performance. Second, we posit that if human resources (HR) policies are viewed as an exchange agreement between the organization and its employees, then a team manager more actively enforcing espoused HR practices may positively influence the sense of human resource management (HRM)-induced psychological contract fulfillment of team members, which in turn influences individual in-role performance and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Our hypotheses are tested with data from 183 matched responses from 51 teams, and the results generally support both the team-level and multilevel hypotheses.

"This article reviews the strategic decision making literature by focusing on the dominant paradigms-i.e., rationality and bounded rationality, politics and power, and garbage can. We review the theory and key empirical support, and identify emergent debates within each paradigm. We conclude that strategic decision makers are boundedly rational, that power wins battles of choice, and that chance matters. Further, we argue that these paradigms rest on unrealistic assumptions and tired controversies which are no longer very controversial. We conclude with a research agenda that emphasizes a more realistic view of strategic decision makers and decision making, and greater attention to normative implications, especially among profit-seeking firms in global contexts.","['STRATEGIC DECISION MAKING', 'BOUNDED RATIONALITY', 'POLITICS', 'POWER', 'GARBAGE CANHIGH-VELOCITY ENVIRONMENTS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL DECISION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'UNIVERSITY', 'GARBAGE', 'CONSENSUS', 'INDUSTRY', 'POWER', 'FIRM', 'COMPREHENSIVENESS']","['strategic decision making', 'strategic decision making', 'strategic decision making', 'bounded rationality', 'bounded rationality', 'politics', 'power', 'garbage', 'power', 'firm']",bounded
"Since its inception, the concept of absorptive capacity has been closely linked with notions of organizational learning. Yet the precise nature of the relationship between these two concepts has never been established. This relationship is examined in a variety of ways, and it is suggested that the literature on these two concepts shares a conceptual affinity which needs to be delineated. It is suggested that absorptive capacity (a dynamic capability) is a concrete example of organizational learning that concerns an organization's relationship with new external knowledge.

"This study explores how positioning a brand as global and/or local iconic can moderate the impact of advertising frequency (AF) on brand attitudes in an emerging market context. We argue that brands may be seen as the source of an advertisement and that the positioning of a brand can thus enhance source attractiveness, and/or source credibility, which in turn facilitate the impact of AF on brand attitudes. Our results support that both a global and a local iconic positioning enhance the AF-brand image relationship, but they do not have an effect on the AF-brand quality relationship. Additionally, we examine whether source attractiveness and source credibility mediate these moderation effects and find that only source attractiveness is a significant mediator. Additionally, we investigate whether a hybrid positioning strategy (i.e., positioning as both global and local iconic) is beneficial. Results indicate that a separate positioning (i.e., global or local iconic) is a better strategy to increase the attractiveness of the advertising source and in turn facilitate the effect of advertising frequency to create brand image.","['advertising', 'branding and brand management', 'emerging markets/countries/economies', 'global brands', 'local iconic brandsSOURCE CREDIBILITY', 'CULTURE', 'REPETITION', 'CONSUMERS', 'APPEALS', 'EQUITY', 'SPACE']",['advertising'],advertising frequency source attractiveness source credibility image
"This exploratory study provides a review of the neglected area of entrepreneurial founder team turnover. A novel distinction is made between entrepreneurial founder team member entry and team member exit. Ninety owner-managed ventures were monitored between 1990 and 2000. Presented hypotheses relating to a team's human capital were explored using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Variables associated with entry were found not to be the same as those associated with exit. The size of the founding team was significantly negatively associated with subsequent team member entry. The link between team turnover and entrepreneurial team heterogeneity was mixed. Functional heterogeneity was weakly significantly positively associated with team member entry. Heterogeneity of prior entrepreneurial experience was significantly positively associated with team member exit. In addition, family firms were significantly negatively associated with team member exit. The average age of the team was not significantly associated with team member entry or exit. Additional insights in future research may be gathered if a broader definition of team turnover (i.e., considering team member entry and exit) is considered. Practitioner awareness of the different factors associated with team member entry and exit may encourage them to provide assistance, which facilitates the team building process over time in developing firms.

"Purpose - The relationship between supply chain management (SCM) competency and firm performance is not well established empirically. This is largely because proven metrics for quantifying the effects of SCM are scarce. Drawing on the strategic managerial concept of supply chain orientation as a source of competitive advantage, this paper aims to apply three independent sources of secondary data to examine the influence of SCM competency on two important firm performance metrics: customer satisfaction and shareholder value. Design/methodology/approach - SCM competency is assessed with data from the expert opinion element of Gartner Supply Chain Group's (formerly AMR Research) supply chain top 25 rankings; the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) database and the recently developed Economic Value Added (EVA) Momentum financial metric are utilized as outcome measures. Findings - Firms recognized by peers and experts for superior SCM competency exhibit higher levels of customer satisfaction and shareholder value than their respective industry averages. Research limitations/implications - Further evidence is required to prove causality does exist between these variables. Limitations associated with the use of secondary data restricted the number of top performer firms available for this analysis. Nevertheless, the strong correlations found between SCM competency and two critical firm performance metrics may help senior managers and managers from other functional areas to better understand potential advantages associated with developing greater SCM competency. Practical implications - The assessment of two metrics that differentiate top SCM performers from their industry competitors may also help SCM professionals to better convey the impact of SCM competency to non-supply chain managers and external participants in the supply chain whose support and cooperation are critical to the success of process improvement initiatives. Originality/value - In addition to the study findings, blending qualitative expert opinion, formal customer satisfaction and quantitative financial performance secondary data represents a relatively novel and informative method that responds to contentions that different approaches should be employed to develop a more holistic understanding of SCM.","['Supply chain management competency', 'Customer satisfaction', 'Shareholder value analysis', 'Economic value added', 'Supply chain management metrics', 'Delphi methodORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'INTEGRATION', 'FRAMEWORK', 'IMPACT', 'PROFITABILITY', 'CAPABILITIES', 'ASSOCIATION']","['customer satisfaction', 'customer satisfaction', 'economic value added', 'economic value added', 'economic value added', 'firm performance', 'firm performance', 'impact']",supply chain management performance orientation customer satisfaction shareholder
"We revisit Karen Legge's (2001) critique of HRM in which she argues that the attempt of modernist/positivist HRM research to show that HRM improves organizational performance is a 'spent round'. We note that despite spirited challenges by Legge and others, the discourse of HRM is becoming increasingly dominant. Accordingly, we use discourse analysis to examine why this might be the case. Specifically, we analyse the texts produced in the engagement between Karen Legge and David Guest to show how modernist/positivist texts like those of Guest have been successful in constructing an identity for HRM and embedding it in the broader academic discourse concerning the employment relationship, while critical researchers like Legge face a number of difficulties in producing 'counter-texts'.","['nanHUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT', 'DISCOURSE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'UK', 'ORGANIZATION', 'CONFLICT', 'JOKING', 'GENRES', 'HUMOR']","['discourse', 'performance', 'organization']",discourse analysis guest identity
"This article integrates social network and exchange theory to develop a model of customer value based on three relational drivers: relationship quality (the caliber of relational ties), contact density (the number of relational ties), and contact authority (the decision-making capability of relational contacts). The results suggest that the value generated from interfirm relationships derives not only from the quality of customer ties (e.g., trust, commitment, norms), as is typically modeled, but also from the number and decision-making capability of interfirm contacts and the interactions among relational drivers. Moderator analysis of customer characteristics suggests that increasing contact density benefits sellers that have customers with high employee turnover rates, whereas building relationships with key decisions makers generates the highest returns among customers that are more difficult to access. The conceptual model of the impact of interfirm relational drivers on customer value receives support from dyadic data across 446 business-to-business exchanges.","['relationship marketing', 'interorganizational relationships', 'business-to-business marketing', 'network theory', 'customer valueNETWORK PARADIGM', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGIES', 'INVESTMENTS', 'INDICATORS', 'POSITION', 'TRUST', 'TIES']","['trust', 'ties']",customer value relationship interfirm trust

"When a sales representative (rep) leaves a business-to-business firm, a crucial link with the rep's customers becomes severed. The firm reassigns those customers to different sales reps (either existing reps or new hires) in amanner that mitigates potential sales losses. What causal effect do sales rep departures have on customer-level revenue, and which sales rep replacement strategies are more effective? Using data from a Fortune 500 firm and a difference-indifferences analysis with correction for selection bias, the authors show that sales rep transitions lead to 13.2%-17.6% losses in annual sales. New hires are less effective than existing sales reps in mitigating sales losses. Existing sales reps who are similar (vs. dissimilar) to the departing reps (in terms of past industry experience) are more effective in mitigating sales losses; however, reps with high past performance do not exhibit greater efficacy for mitigating sales losses than reps with average or low past performance. The analysis presents means to quantify the economic consequences of losing a sales rep and to determine how to reassign customers to sales reps according to the resulting economic impact.","['business-to-business marketing', 'customer assignment strategies', 'causal inference', 'difference-in-differences', 'sales representative departureSAMPLE SELECTION BIAS', 'EMPLOYEE TURNOVER', 'JOB-SATISFACTION', 'SALESPEOPLE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TRUST', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'DETERMINANTS', 'METAANALYSIS', 'COMPETITION']",['performance'],performance
"Collaborative filtering (CF) techniques are becoming very popular on the Internet and are widely used in several domains to cope with information overload. E-commerce sites use filtering systems to recommend products to customers based on the preferences of like-minded customers, but their systems do not protect user privacy. Because users concerned about privacy may give false information, it is not easy to collect high-quality user data for collaborative filtering, and recommendation systems using poor data produce inaccurate recommendations. This means that privacy measures are key to the success of collecting high-quality data and providing accurate recommendations. This article discusses collaborative filtering with privacy based on both correlation and singular-value decomposition (SVD) and proposes the use of randomized perturbation techniques to protect user privacy while producing reasonably accurate recommendations. Such techniques add randomness to the original data, preventing the data collector (the server) from learning private user data, but this scheme can still provide accurate recommendations. Experiments were conducted with real datasets to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed scheme. The results were used for analysis of how different parameters affect accuracy. Collaborative filtering systems using randomized perturbation techniques were found to provide accurate recommendations while preserving user privacy.","['accuracy', 'collaborative filtering', 'privacy', 'randomized perturbation', 'SVDnan']","['accuracy', 'collaborative filtering', 'collaborative filtering', 'privacy', 'randomized perturbation', 'randomized perturbation']",collaborative filtering
"Despite a long history of independent sales and service functions within organizations, customers are pressuring organizations to rethink their sales and service operations. Specifically, customers expect organizations to offer a single face'' of the firm rather than being forced to interact with multiple agents across both sales and service throughout their relationships. As firms attempt to meet these customer demands, they have countless options to integrate sales and service operations, but little is known about which strategies are most effective. This article attempts to shed new light into the challenges and potential benefits of salesservice integration, in an effort to spur research in this area and better inform this managerial challenge. Specifically, we formalize the concept of the sales-service interface, discuss how it relates to sales-service ambidexterity, and identify several opportunities for future research. Given the complexity of the sales-service interface, we contend that future researchers must view these issues through a multilevel lens and, as a result, we focus on identifying opportunities ideally suited for testing in a multilevel environment. The goal of this article is to provide a platform for researchers to tackle this challenging problem and generate new insights into how best to meet customer's evolving demands.","['sales-service interface', 'ambidexterity', 'multilevel', 'dynamic capabilitiesR-AND-D', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'AMBIDEXTROUS ORGANIZATIONS', 'RESEARCH PRIORITIES', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'ROLE-CONFLICT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CAPABILITIES', 'SELF']","['sales service interface', 'sales service interface', 'sales service interface', 'ambidexterity', 'multilevel']",firm sales service interface service ambidexterity
"New venture companies, starting from small entities comprising entrepreneurs and their teams, start to grow in scale by instigating formalized processes to enhance management efficiency. This includes the use of formalized processes for collecting and disseminating market information. Despite the fact that utilizing market information is one of the fundamental factors of market orientation, little is known about the way market information is processed in new venture companies. The first aim of this research was to investigate the impact of formalized market information acquisition and utilization on new venture performance. The second objective was to investigate the effect of organizational formalization on the acquisition and utilization of market information in new venture firms. The final goal was to explore the extent to which these relationships vary in different cultural contexts. Based on an extensive literature review and interviews with managers in China, Japan, and the United States, a conceptual framework is developed that relates formalized market information processes to new venture performance in the three countries. The conceptual model is tested with data collected from 453 new venture companies in these countries. The results suggest that the use of a formalized process of market information utilization has a positive effect on new venture performance regardless of country. The analysis also indicates that the effect of organizational formalization, in general, differs between countries. Organizational formalization is associated with increased formalized utilization of market information only in the United States; the relationship does not apply in the two Asian countries studied. Taken together, these results suggest that in the Asian countries, organizational formalization improves information collection, while in the United States, it also improves the utilization of information throughout the organization. One implication of these results may be the potential of added benefits accruing to organizational formalization in new ventures in countries with high levels of individualism and/or high levels of power distance, where organizational power is concentrated in formal vertical reporting relationships, as opposed to informal horizontal peer-to-peer networks.","['nanSMALL BUSINESS', 'ORIENTATION', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'INNOVATION', 'CONSTRUCT']",['orientation'],orientation firms

"Purpose - This case study aims to examine the role of demand management in balancing distribution efficiency and responsiveness to customer needs in the downstream of a retail supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - A major machine part supplier in Australia is used as a case study to investigate the challenges faced by the industry in distributing goods to customers. The use of demand management techniques to help improve distribution efficiency without significantly impacting on responsiveness is also explored. Findings - The findings of the case study reveal that appropriate demand management measures, such as customer segmentation and price discrimination, can help improve overall distribution efficiency of the supply chain while providing the required responsiveness to meet genuine customer needs. Other management attempts, such as vendor-managed inventory and rationalisation of retail network, can facilitate demand aggregation and improve vehicle utilisation in distribution with minor impact on customer service. These changes require a full understanding of customer requirements and supply capabilities of the company as well as corresponding adjustments in business strategy, leadership style, and organisational culture. Research limitations/implications - This study lends insight into the use of demand management techniques to improve efficiency in downstream wholesale and retail distribution, thereby enhancing sustainability and profitability of business. To serve mainly as a case study and an illustration of the approach, the scope of the study is limited to six stores in the distribution network of the case company. Practical implications - Retailers can explore the use of demand management techniques to increase distribution efficiency and hence competitiveness of the company. The approach can also assist managers in adopting best practices among stores and facilitate more effective allocation of distribution resources to serve different market segments. Social implications - Using demand management techniques to increase distribution efficiency can reduce delivery frequency and total travel distance. This will help lessen energy usage, carbon emission, traffic congestion, and other negative impacts on the environment. Originality/value - Research in retail distribution efficiency to date focuses mainly on delivery optimisation through routing and scheduling. Attempts to link demand with supply and use demand management techniques to improve distribution efficiency are relatively limited. This paper fills the gap in the literature by investigating the value of demand management in distribution and explores empirically the significance of the approach to achieve higher wholesale and retail distribution efficiency.","['Demand management', 'Customer segmentation', 'Price discrimination', 'Retail supply chain', 'Distribution', 'Efficiency', 'Distribution management', 'Process efficiencySUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATION', 'MARKET-SEGMENTATION', 'REVERSE LOGISTICS', 'CONSOLIDATION', 'STRATEGIES', 'INVENTORY', 'INDUSTRY', 'SYSTEMS', 'DESIGN']","['demand management', 'demand management', 'customer segmentation', 'customer segmentation', 'price discrimination', 'price discrimination', 'retail supply chain', 'retail supply chain', 'retail supply chain', 'distribution', 'efficiency', 'inventory', 'industry', 'design']",demand management distribution efficiency australia
"Research summary: Attaining optimal distinctiveness-positive stakeholder perceptions about a firm's strategic position that reconciles competing demands for differentiation and conformity-has been an important focal point for scholarship at the interface of strategic management and institutional theory. We provide a comprehensive review of this literature and situate studies on optimal distinctiveness in the broader scholarly effort to integrate institutional theory into strategic management. Our review finds that much extant research on firm-level optimal distinctiveness is grounded in the strategic balance perspective that conceptualizes conformity and competitive differentiation as a trade-off along a single organizational attribute. We argue for a renewed research agenda that draws on recent developments in institutional theory to conceptualize organizational environments as more multiplex, fragmented, and dynamic, and discuss its implications for core strategic management topics. Managerial summary: This article aims to provide managers with a more comprehensive and contemporary view of how firms can become optimally distinct-being different enough from peer firms to be competitive, but similar enough to peers to be recognizable. We aim to equip managers with an understanding of firms as complex, multidimensional entities, and encourage them to identify and orchestrate various types of strategic resources to reconcile conformity versus differentiation tensions, address the multiplicity of stakeholder expectations, and aptly modify their positioning strategies in order to succeed in dynamic environments.

"Experiential purchases, such as movies, theme parks, and vacations, represent a unique, and exceedingly popular, type of marketing behavior. Despite the increasing popularity of purchased experiences, the question of what makes one experiential purchase superior to another remains elusive. Using a multimethod, grounded theory approach, the authors perform two qualitative studies that reveal high-quality experiential purchases are composed of five dimensions: uniqueness, fun, escapism, servicescape quality, and social congruence. Next, an empirical model of experiential purchase quality (EPQ) and its outcome variables is tested in two different settings. The results find support for the EPQ conceptualization and uncover that a high-quality experiential purchase can positively influence braggart word of mouth, nostalgia, and self-connectedness to the experience while also lowering price consciousness perceptions to repeat the experience. A comparison of short and long experiences found that customers put a heavier weighting on concepts such as escapism and social congruence in shorter experiences where longer experiences had a heavier emphasis on the servicescape and perceptions of fun. From a managerial perspective, our results highlight that a one-size-fits all approach in experiential management is problematic. Managers need to understand that customers have different evaluative criteria depending on the length of an experiential purchase.","['experiential purchases', 'experiential marketing', 'nostalgia', 'braggart behavior', 'social congruence', 'servicescapeMULTIPLE-ITEM SCALE', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'CONSUMPTION', 'NOSTALGIA', 'HAPPINESS', 'MODELS', 'MATERIALISM', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'ATTACHMENT', 'RESPONSES']","['experiential purchases', 'experiential purchases', 'nostalgia', 'social congruence', 'social congruence', 'perceptions', 'nostalgia', 'perspective']",experiential purchases quality escapism nostalgia
"Marketing adaptation strategy has been characterized as a strategic imperative in markets with protectionist and nationalist sentiments, which underscores the need to better understand the effects of adaptation strategy. However, empirical investigations of international marketing strategy have considered mandatory and discretionary adaptations as equivalent. Discretionary adaptations, unlike mandatory adaptations, involve choice; thus, they are more relevant to the selection of an international marketing strategy. This article focuses on the direct and conditional effects of discretionary adaptation on export performance. Analyzing data from 203 U.S. small and medium-sized enterprises, the authors find a positive effect of discretionary adaptation on export performance as well as moderating effects of (1) a market characteristic (psychic distance), (2) a firm characteristic (international experience), and (3) a product characteristic (product positional advantage). The implications suggest that adaptation strategy may be more advantageous than previously thought, and that researchers should focus on discretionary adaptations when investigating the choice of a relatively standardized versus adapted international marketing strategy.","['discretionary adaptation', 'international marketing strategy', 'export performance', 'small and medium-sized enterprisesINTERNATIONAL MARKETING-STRATEGY', 'POSITIONAL ADVANTAGE', 'PSYCHIC DISTANCE', 'PRODUCT PERFORMANCE', 'CULTURAL DISTANCE', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'FOREIGN-MARKET', 'SERVICE FIRMS', 'STANDARDIZATION', 'FIT']","['discretionary adaptation', 'discretionary adaptation', 'international marketing strategy', 'international marketing strategy', 'international marketing strategy', 'export performance', 'export performance', 'positional advantage', 'positional advantage', 'psychic distance', 'psychic distance']",international choice distance international marketing strategy
"In this paper we examine how the interaction between influences of commercial banking and poverty alleviation shaped the evolution of modern microfinance. Using institutional theory as a lens, we observe that the commercial banking logic increasingly displaced the microfinance field's foundational poverty alleviation and development principles over time. We argue that this process of displacement can occur inadvertently as organizations that embody multiple logics draw disproportionately on only one of those logics when developing legitimating accounts of their activity to stakeholders. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of permeability - the extent to which the elements of a logic are ambiguous and loosely coupled - to explain why some logics may be more or less open to the influence of other logics. We conclude by discussing implications for entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation more generally. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"How universal are resource-based advantages? In this study, the authors suggest that differences in nations' institutional environments may influence the applicability of resource-based advantages; for this reason, the effectiveness of such advantages may vary cross-nationally. They hypothesize and find that adding the moderating influence of national institutional environment to a resource-based perspective better explains strategic decisions (entry mode choice) in an international context than does a mere resource-based approach. The analysis also shows that decisions predicted by a model incorporating both perspectives yield better subsidiary performance. Thus, results suggest that, at least in an international setting, resource-based advantages appear to be context specific. Based on these results, the authors conclude that considering country-specific contextual influences on the value of resource-based advantages allows firms to make strategic decisions that improve international subsidiary performance.","['resource-based view', 'institutional theory', 'context specificity', 'performance', 'dynamic capabilitiesENTRY MODE CHOICE', 'TRANSACTION COST', 'FIRM CAPABILITIES', 'FOREIGN-MARKET', 'VIEW', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGY', 'EXPLOITATION', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'COOPERATION']","['performance', 'performance', 'environments']",resource based advantages entry mode choice
"Are romance movies more desirable when people are cold? Building on research on (bodily) feeling-as-information and embodied cognition, we hypothesize that physical coldness activates a need for psychological warmth, which in turn leads to an increased liking for romance movies. Four laboratory experiments and an analysis of online movie rental data provide support for our hypothesis. Specifically, studies 1A and 1B show that physical coldness increases the liking of and willingness to pay for romance movies. Study 2 shows that the effect of physical coldness on liking of romance movies only occurs for people who associate romance movies with psychological warmth. Study 3 shows that people correct for the influence of physical coldness on their liking of romance movies when physical coldness is made salient. In study 4, using data on online movie rentals and historical temperature, we found a negative relationship between weather temperature and preference for romance movies.","['nanEMBODIMENT', 'COGNITION', 'SADNESS', 'CULTURE', 'ANXIETY', 'MOOD', 'SELF']",['cognition'],romance physical coldness psychological warmth temperature

"Recent research has conceptualized legitimacy as a multi-level phenomenon comprising propriety and validity. Propriety refers to an individual evaluator's belief that a legitimacy object is appropriate for its social context, whereas validity denotes an institutionalized, collective-level perception of appropriateness. In this article, we refine this multi-level understanding of legitimacy by adding a third, meso-level construct of 'consensus', which we define as the agreement between evaluators' propriety beliefs. Importantly, validity and consensus are distinct and can be incongruent, given that an institutionalized perception can hide underlying disagreement. Disentangling validity from consensus is a crucial extension of the multi-level theory of legitimacy, because it enables an improved understanding of the legitimacy processes that precede sudden and unanticipated institutional change. In particular, while previous works considered revised propriety beliefs as the starting point for institutional change, our account emphasizes that the disclosure of the actual (vs. merely assumed) belief distribution within a social context may instigate institutional change. To study the interplay of propriety, validity, and consensus empirically, we propose a set of experimental designs specifically geared towards improving knowledge of the role of legitimacy and its components in institutional change.","['consensus', 'experiments', 'institutional change', 'legitimacy', 'microfoundations', 'propriety', 'validityORGANIZATIONAL LEGITIMACY', 'SOCIAL MEDIA', 'PLURALISTIC IGNORANCE', 'RHETORICAL STRATEGIES', 'INSTITUTIONAL THEORY', 'MANAGING LEGITIMACY', 'EMOTIONAL-REACTIONS', 'PUBLIC-OPINION', 'MODEL', 'MANAGEMENT']","['consensus', 'institutional change', 'institutional change', 'legitimacy', 'propriety']",legitimacy propriety institutional change institutional change
"In this paper, we examine how employee mobility impacts the human capital of both those who are new to the organization (movers) and those who are existing members (incumbents). Employee mobility events can disrupt both the location-specific and the colleague-specific components of human capital and thus have different impacts on overall human capital. We test our theory on the disparate effects of location change and personnel change on human capital in the highly interdependent context of the National Basketball Association. We find that movers experience adverse performance shocks after mobility events that are moderated when moving as a group, and we also find that group mobility events hinder the performance improvement of incumbents. Our findings are consistent with the limited transfer of location-specific human capital and the disruption of colleague-specific human capital after mobility events.","['knowledge transfer/replication', 'strategic HRM', 'groups/group processes/dynamics', 'teamsCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'EMPLOYEE MOBILITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'EXPERIENCE', 'RESOURCE', 'FIRMS', 'JOB', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'METAANALYSIS']","['employee mobility', 'employee mobility', 'performance', 'experience']",mobility
"Over the past decade, knowledge management (KM), as a concept and a set of practices, has penetrated into the fabric of organizational and managerial processes in the healthcare sector, which has been the site of numerous innovative KM practices. As a result scholars from a range of academic (and non-academic) fields have begun to document how KM is conceived and practised in health care, what the recurrent issues are and how they can be addressed. The purpose of this paper is to review the current literature on KM concepts, policies and practices in the healthcare sector. Based on the analysis of the most relevant contributions in the last six years, three overarching themes that have occupied the interests of authors are identified and discussed: the nature of knowing in the healthcare sector, the type of KM tools and initiatives that are suitable for the healthcare sector, and the barriers and enablers to the take up of KM practices. The paper concludes with some considerations on what the literature tells us about the state of the art and the future of KM in this important sector of Western economies.","['nanDECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEMS', 'REFLECTIVE PRACTICE', 'CLINICAL-PRACTICE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'NETWORKS', 'COMMUNITIES', 'QUALITY', 'NHS', 'TRANSLATION', 'PERFORMANCE']",['management'],knowledge healthcare care
"Self-service technologies (SSTs), such as in-store kiosks, are increasingly prevalent and becoming a critical component of marketing. Researchers and practitioners alike have recognized the need to understand the effectiveness of these computer-based innovations for self-services-in particular, how to strengthen customers' perceived control over and evaluations of SSTs. Drawing on the resource-matching theory and the technology-based services and self-services literature, the authors hypothesize the interactive effects of two SST design features-namely, comparative information and interactivity-on customers' perceived control and interface evaluations. The authors then propose that the interaction pattern is further moderated by two individual traits: prior experience and technology readiness. The hypotheses are tested in two separate computer-based experiments with representative samples of the general U.S. population in a shopping environment. The findings support the hypotheses, enhancing knowledge in this emerging domain and providing important implications for managers and researchers.","['self-service technology effectiveness', 'comparative information', 'interactivity', 'experience', 'technology readiness', 'resource-matching theoryCONSUMER', 'QUALITY', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'DIMENSIONS', 'PERSUASION', 'EXPERIENCE', 'RESOURCES', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'DELIVERY', 'BEHAVIOR']","['comparative information', 'comparative information', 'interactivity', 'experience', 'technology readiness', 'technology readiness', 'experience', 'knowledge']",based innovations technology based services experience technology readiness
"Organizational noncompliance with legal rules can be consequential. The antecedents of such noncompliance as well as the remediation of it thus remain enduring subjects of research inquiry. However, prior studies have implicitly treated all rules alike. In contrast, we argue that rules are not all the same and that differences between rules might be systematically linked to variations in the likelihoods of noncompliance and remediation across the range of organizations under the purview of a rule system. We consider the role of two fundamental but distinct sources of rule complexity: components (i.e., sections that compose a rule) and connections (i.e., functional links to other rules in the same system). We analyzed data from 81,266 rule-level observations from 1,011 health inspections of 289 restaurants in Santa Monica, California, conducted from 2007 to 2010. As hypothesized, increases in either source of rule complexity were associated with higher probabilities of noncompliance. Unexpectedly, however, the two sources of rule complexity had divergent effects on remediation such that increases in the number of connections were associated with higher probabilities of repeated noncompliance, whereas increases in the number of components were not. Taken together, we suggest that our understanding of noncompliance and remediation can be enhanced by viewing them both as rule-level phenomena. A range of implications for theory and practice are discussed.","['noncompliance', 'remediation', 'legal rules', 'organizational routines', 'organizational learning', 'regulatory inspectionsTASK COMPLEXITY', 'SAFETY CLIMATE', 'SOCIAL-CONTROL', 'ROUTINES', 'MODEL', 'CAPABILITIES', 'HYGIENE', 'FIRM', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'INFORMATION']","['noncompliance', 'remediation', 'legal rules', 'legal rules']",organizational noncompliance rule complexity
"Large firms differ from smaller firms in many aspects. In this research note, we investigate the relationship between the size of firm and the characteristics of equity joint ventures (EJVs). Empirically, we found that very large firms are more likely to have a higher equity stake in their EJVs, seek alignment with other foreign firms, engage in global industries, and invest in large-scale EJV's than smaller firms. They are also less affected by the risk conditions of the host country. Empirical testing is based on a sample of 1,298 foreign EJVs in the People's Republic of China between 1981 and 1998.

"This paper examines the relationships of job attitudes (facets of job satisfaction and organizational commitment) and personality characteristics to absenteeism, in five manufacturing companies in Barbados, an English-speaking Caribbean country. The relationships examined are based on well-established theories from the developed world, especially the USA. In addition, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and power distance were measured. The results show that an employee's levels of satisfaction with co-workers, activity, responsibility, and job security, as well as loyalty to the organization, are related to absenteeism. These results are similar to those found in past research in the developed world. The most important single predictor of absence was satisfaction with co-workers. Respondents were moderate on individualism, high on uncertainty avoidance, and low on power distance. The cultural scores are used to help interpret the results. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of expanding the reach of an established theory, and relative to decreasing absenteeism in Barbados. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

"Results from four studies uncover a relatively automatic cultural congruency mechanism that can influence evaluations of culturally charged brand extensions, overriding the impact of perceived fit on extension evaluations. Culturally congruent extensions (i.e., when both the brand and the extension category cue the same cultural schema) were evaluated more favorably than culturally neutral extensions, which in turn were evaluated more favorably than culturally incongruent ones (i.e., cue two different cultural schemas). The effects emerged with both moderate and low fit brand extensions, as well as for narrow and broad brands. However, they only emerged when both the brand and the product were culturally symbolic, likely to automatically activate a cultural schema but did not emerge for brands low in cultural symbolism. The effects were driven by the processing (dis) fluency generated by the simultaneous activation of the same (different) cultural schemas by the product and the brand.","['nanINCIDENTAL AD EXPOSURE', 'PRODUCT EVALUATIONS', 'REGULATORY FIT', 'ORIGIN', 'EXTENSIONS', 'COUNTRY', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'FLUENCY', 'IMPACT']","['extensions', 'fluency', 'impact']",brand extensions symbolism
"Unlike prior research that has confined customer rage to a single point in time, this article explores the unfolding of rage over three time periods, at the initial service failure (Episode 1) and two ineffective service recovery attempts (Episodes 2 and 3). In each episode, we examine the association between loss, or a threat of loss, of personal resources (e.g., self-esteem, sense of justice, sense of control, and economic resources such as time and money) and negative emotions. We empirically demonstrate for the first time that although rage may sometimes take place at the initial service failure (Episode 1), rage does not tend to be an immediate reaction. Rather, it is when service failures remain unresolved that residual negative emotions are carried forward into the next episode, so that rage is dominant in Episodes 2 and 3. This carryover of negative emotion spirals with more resources being threatened, propelling the customer into rage. The authors offer a methodological contribution demonstrating the dynamic nature of appraisals and emotions in a sequence of related episodes in the elicitation of rage. Finally, differences between U.S. and Thai responses are discussed with important theoretical and managerial implications.","['customer rage', 'emotions', 'anger', 'customer experience', 'service failure and recoverySERVICE ENCOUNTERS', 'EMOTION REGULATION', 'RECOVERY', 'FAILURE', 'CULTURE', 'IMPACT', 'SELF', 'CONSERVATION', 'SATISFACTION', 'EXPERIENCE']","['customer rage', 'customer rage', 'emotions', 'recovery', 'failure', 'self']",emotions

"Purpose - Standardization of materials (i.e. replacement of several materials/components by a single component that has all the functionalities of the materials/components it replaces) is one important purchasing department decision. The primary objective of this study is to examine empirically the impact of standardization of materials and purchasing procedures (standardization in purchasing) on purchasing and business performance. Design/methodology/approach - To address our research problem, a survey instrument was developed and a structural model was hypothesized and tested using structural equation modeling. Data were collected from a field research on a sample of 306 manufacturing companies in Spain. Findings - The results of this research indicate that standardization in purchasing has a significant positive effect on both purchasing and business performance. Thus, standardizing materials and purchasing procedures is important and may help firms to meet their materials expenditure targets, and increase the quality of materials, on-time delivery from suppliers, inventory performance, as well as business performance. Research limitations/implications - One of the limitations of the study is that the use of a single key informant could be seen as a potential limitation of the study. The study was a cross-sectional and descriptive sample of the manufacturing industry at a given point in time. A more stringent test of the relationships between standardization in purchasing and performance requires a longitudinal study, or field experiment. Practical implications - the empirically validated positive relation of standardization in purchasing to firms' performance, such as that documented in this study, can be very useful for the managers who take the initiative in standardization to promote and obtain the resources needed for the adoption of standardization of materials and purchasing procedures. Standardization in purchasing has, as this study shows, much to offer firms that wish to improve their performance. Originality/value - Because there is a lack of empirical evidence about the impact of standardization of materials and purchasing procedures (standardization in purchasing) on purchasing and business performance, this paper filled an important gap in the purchasing literature.","['standardization', 'purchasing techniques', 'SpainCOMPONENT COMMONALITY', 'SUPPLY CHAIN', 'QUALITY', 'COSTS', 'BUYER']","['standardization', 'quality']",
"Marketing strategists who operate in turbulent markets face a competitive landscape marked by volatility and evolving market structures. As customer requirements change, an organization that stays in alignment with its markets will form new business units or alter the market charters of existing business units. In a longitudinal study, the authors traced the structural realignments that accompanied a Fortune-500 firm's entry into the Internet market. As the charter moved from a freshly created unit to an established business unit, the authors found support for the prediction that the former organizational structure will continue to shape the identity, beliefs, and social ties of managers. The study highlights the structural, social, and cognitive factors that must be managed as corporate decision makers search for the best strategy-structure fit for an emerging market opportunity.","['nanPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'IDENTITY', 'FIRM', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'RESOURCE', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'INNOVATION', 'EVOLUTION', 'CORPORATE']","['identity', 'firm', 'corporate']",internet
"When a choice set consists of a distribution of alternatives with correlated benefits and costs, consumers often exhibit single-peaked preferences-they prefer an alternative having moderate costs and benefits. Theories disagree about how adding additional lower benefit/lower cost or higher benefit/higher cost alternatives to this choice set will affect relative preferences for the initial set of alternatives. Prototype theory predicts that adding alternatives should produce assimilation, whereas multiattribute range-frequency theory predicts that it creates contrast. We reconcile these two theories by assuming that single-peaked preferences reflect a composition of underlying benefit and cost valuations. Moreover, we claim that the correlational structure of the benefit and cost dimensions in the contextual stimuli determines whether these stimuli will exert an assimilation or contrast effect. We show that when benefits and costs are correlated (uncorrelated), adding alternatives that extend the range of offerings produces assimilation (contrast) for preference judgments. We propose a cost-benefit trade-off model that incorporates elements of single-peaked preference theory and range-frequency theory to explain the complex fashion in which contextual stimuli affect consumer ideals.","['nanCHOICE', 'CONTRAST', 'JUDGMENT', 'PRICE', 'SIMILARITY', 'PREFERENCE', 'RANGE', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'ATTRACTION', 'FEATURES']","['contrast', 'judgment', 'preference', 'range']",assimilation frequency

"Strategy implementation and performance in organizations are influenced by its market orientation. Market orientation is the collective of employee behaviors that affects strategy implementation, how an organization interacts with its environment and adjusts to changes within that context. The relationship between market orientation, strategy implementation, and performance is robust across environmental contexts. This study identifies ideal behavioral profiles for organizations seeking to maximize performance by considering the scope and impact of market orientation on strategy implementation. This is accomplished by considering market orientation and strategy profiles in relation to performance in a holistic coalignment perspective, corresponding to competitive contexts characterized by varying degrees of market turbulence and competitive intensity. Important strategic and performance implications of this dynamic are revealed that should be considered by academics and practitioners alike.

"Purpose - The paper seeks to ascertain some of the implications of the supply chain configuration for important elements of the chain's management at an automaker using the industrial condominium configuration. Design/methodology/approach - In an attempt to identify the main motivating factors for the adoption of an industrial condominium configuration, a basic case study framework was built to guide and define the key content of the research. The framework considers simplification, cost reduction, process integration, and shared infrastructure as the four main interdependent factors that impel and drive an automaker's implementation of a condominium. It also considers product and process management, logistics management, performance assessment and relationship management as business processes significantly affected by implementation of the condominium. Using an intentional sampling approach, a case study was made of an automaker that uses the industrial condominium configuration, and of four of its representative suppliers. Findings - The study confirmed that the supply chain's configuration is indeed a determining element in the way the automaker's relationship with its suppliers is conducted and substantiated the importance of the logistics management process within the context of the condominium. Research limitations/implications - The research reported involved only one case study. Practical implications - The paper proposes and discusses four interdependent factors that motivate and drive an automaker's implementation of a contemporary industrial condominium in the auto industry. Originality/value - The study was conducted in a supply chain with an automaker using an industrial condominium and four suppliers situated in different positions, and contributes mainly to the understanding of new forms of supply chain configuration.","['automotive inclustry', 'supply chain management', 'suppliers', 'Brazilnan']",['suppliers'],condominium
"Visual elements of packaging design serve as a powerful, cost-efficient tool for manufacturers and retailers alike to communicate sensory features of the product to consumers and influence their consumption behaviors. Based on studies of packaging design, cross-modal correspondences, and food science, this research establishes a packaging visual-gustatory correspondence effect whereby the image of a food product placed at the bottom (vs. top) of the package facade enhances consumers' expectations (Study 1A) and actual perceptions (Study 1B) of the food's flavor heaviness. Further, this effect carries over to help consumers make healthier eating decisions such as eating less of the food (Study 2) and subsequently choosing a healthier snack (Study 3). This research also shows that the packaging visual-gustatory correspondence effect is moderated by consumers' processing style such that those who engage in holistic (vs. analytic) processing are more affected by the location of the food image on the package facade (Study 4). Our theoretically novel findings are also conducive to addressing the self-control dilemma: The location of the food image on the package facade can serve to increase flavor perception but decrease consumption quantity.

"Research summary: Agency theory suggests that external governance mechanisms (e.g., activist owners, the market for corporate control, securities analysts) can deter managers from acting opportunistically. Using cognitive evaluation theory, we argue that powerful expectations imposed by external governance can impinge on top managers' feelings of autonomy and crowd out their intrinsic motivation, potentially leading to financial fraud. Our findings indicate that external pressure from activist owners, the market for corporate control, and securities analysts increases managers' likelihood of financial fraud. Our study considers external governance from a top manager's perspective and questions one of agency theory's foundational tenets: that external pressure imposed on managers reduces the potential for moral hazard.Managerial summary: Many of us are familiar with stories about top managers cooking the books in one way or another. As a result, companies and regulatory bodies often implement strict controls to try to prevent financial fraud. However, cognitive evaluation theory describes how those external controls could actually have the opposite of their intended effect because they rob managers of their intrinsic motivation for behaving appropriately. We find this to be the case. When top managers face more stringent external control mechanisms, in the form of activist shareholders, the threat of a takeover, or zealous securities analysts, they are actually more likely to engage in financial misbehavior.

"Two experiments examined the effect of interacting with a virtual object ( object interactivity) on true and false memories. Although object interactivity may improve memory of associations compared to static pictures and text, it may lead to the creation of vivid internally generated recollections that pose as real memories. Consequently, compared to information conveyed via static pictures and text, object interactivity may cause people to falsely recognize more nonpresented features. The results support these hypotheses and provide converging evidence that this false-recognition effect is due to using imagery during retrieval and is robust, emerging regardless of individuals' goals (to search or browse) or learning intent.","['nanCONSUMER MEMORY', 'INFORMATION', 'RECOGNITION', 'ELABORATION']","['information', 'recognition']",pictures text

"This paper examines the effect of diversification upon intra-industry performance. We propose that intra-industry diversification promises three sets of benefits, which, separately and in combination, provide firms with a competitive advantage: synergies arising from economies of scoppe; premiums from mutual forbearance enabled by multi-market competition; and efficiencies derived from market structuration. The additive and integrative effects of the first two have not been explored. The benefits of market structuration remain untheorized and thus untested. The test of our theoretical model in the Canadian general insurance industry indicates that mutual forbearance provides advantage under specified conditions, that market structuration also provides advantages, but that diversification per se does not.

"Acquisitions enable firms to access new knowledge from target firms, along with the scientists who created the knowledge, to enhance their own knowledge creation outcomes. We explore how the retention of target firm scientists and acquired knowledge characteristics affect new knowledge creation outcomes for the acquiring firms. Using a sample of 111,227 patents following 301 high-tech acquisitions in 1990-2000, we find that acquiring firms that avoid the exodus of target firm scientists increase their likelihood of creating highly impactful knowledge. Moreover, the characteristics of acquired knowledge and organizational context of the acquiring firms moderate this relationship. The positive effect of target firm scientist retention on the likelihood of creating highly impactful knowledge during the post-acquisition period is stronger when the acquired knowledge is complex, whereas such a relationship is weaker when the acquired knowledge stock is similar to that of the acquiring firm.","['acquisition', 'breakthrough knowledge', 'human capital specificity', 'knowledge-based viewRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITIONS', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'EMPLOYEE MOBILITY', 'ESTABLISHED FIRMS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'SEARCH', 'CAPABILITIES', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP']",['acquisition'],

"To better understand whether the transition by Asian countries toward market economies mirrors the path taken in the West, we ask how embedded network ties between equity analysts and the chief executive officers (CEOs) of the firms that they follow in India influence the accuracy of analysts' earnings forecasts. We contrast traditional institutions of caste and regional language with contemporary institutions, such as universities, as the locus of such ties. We posit that CEOs from the postreform generation are more likely to transfer material private information via their school ties, while prereform-generation CEOs favor caste or language ties. Contrasting, domestic business groups (BGs) with Western multinational corporations (MNCs) as organizational contexts, we argue that BGs legitimate the transfer of private information along particularistic ties; whereas MNCs mitigate such transfers. Our conceptual framework is supported by analyses that draw on a sample of 1,552 earnings forecasts issued between 2001 and 2010 by 296 equity analysts. Our findings suggest that the embeddedness perspective should be broadened to incorporate the influence of the larger historical social structures within which economic action is embedded, and to view BGs as carriers and repositories that blend modern management practices with particularistic behavioral patterns among top executives.","['nanBUSINESS GROUPS', 'EMERGING MARKETS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ANALYSTS', 'EMBEDDEDNESS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'NETWORKS', 'IMPACT', 'FIRMS', 'TRANSITION']","['analysts', 'embeddedness', 'management', 'firms', 'transition']",firms earnings forecasts information business groups multinational corporations embeddedness

"Using social networks, we examined the founder's influence on key strategic behaviors in Mexican family business. First, we drew on a sample of 42 Mexican family businesses and 201 managers to show how founder centrality affects the top management group (TMG) members' cohesiveness. TMG members' cohesiveness was examined in terms of the firm's culture, its strategic vision, and strategic goals. Second, we examined how founder centrality and top management member group cohesiveness are related to performance in terms of financial, social and family-oriented objectives. Significant relationships were found between a founder's centrality and the TMGs strategic behavior. Further, significant results connect different aspects of the founder's centrality and the TMGs strategic behavior to financial, social and family-oriented objectives. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

"Nonprofit firms' reliance on donations to build inventory distinguishes them from traditional retailers. This reliance on consumer donations means that these organizations face an inherently more volatile supply chain than retailers that source inventory from manufacturers. The authors propose that consumer reluctance to part with possessions with sentimental value causes a bottleneck in the donation process. The goal of this research is therefore to provide nonprofits with tools to increase donations of used goods and provide a theoretical link between the literature streams on prosocial behavior, disposition, memory, and identity. As such, the authors explore the effectiveness of memory preservation strategies (e.g., taking a photo of a good before donating it) in increasing donations to nonprofits. A field study using a donation drive demonstrates that encouraging consumers to take photos of sentimental possessions before donating them increases donations, and five laboratory experiments explicate this result by mapping the proposed psychological process behind the success of memory preservation techniques. Specifically, these techniques operate by ameliorating consumers' perceived identity loss when considering donation of sentimental goods.","['nonprofit marketing', 'donation', 'memory', 'identity', 'product dispositionPREFERENCE REVERSALS', 'SELF', 'EXPRESSION', 'VALUATION', 'DECISIONS', 'SALIENCE', 'SELVES', 'TIME']","['donation', 'memory', 'identity', 'time']",sentimental value memory preservation
"In line with repeated recent calls for research on specific forms of growth rather than on an undifferentiated notion of total growth, our study contributes to the understanding of entrepreneurial growth. By this we mean growth through expansion into new geographic markets and/or via the introduction of new products or services. Building on Penrose's theory of the growth of the firm and on the research streams she has in part inspired, we investigate the impact of knowledge acquisition from international markets on entrepreneurial growth both at home and abroad. We further suggest that the effects of international knowledge acquisition on entrepreneurial growth will vary with firm age. Utilizing longitudinal data on 138 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we find that the acquisition of knowledge from international markets fuels growth through market development, and that this effect is stronger for international expansion than domestic expansion. Our results also show that firm age negatively moderates the relationship between international knowledge acquisition and entrepreneurial growth via the introduction of new products or services. Specifically, international knowledge acquisition has a positive effect on growth via new products/services development in young firms, but a negative effect in mature firms. We assume this reflects changes over time in how international knowledge is managed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"Early corporate turnaround theorists argued that strategic reorientations are central to the recovery process at many declining firms. However, subsequent large-sample empirical studies have reported that performance turnarounds for declining firms are primarily associated with cutback actions that increase efficiency, thus creating a gap between theory and empirical findings. We close this gap by presenting and empirically supporting a model proposing that the extent of strategic change initiated in a successful turnaround varies systematically with a declining firm's need and capacity to reorient its strategy. Based on our model, we offer explanations for why past large-sample researchers were not able to verify the role of strategic change in the turnaround process and we reassert the adaptive role that strategic reorientations have in the turnaround attempts of declining firms with weak strategic positions.","['corporate turnarounds', 'strategic change', 'organizational declineDECLINE', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'RECOVERY', 'RETRENCHMENT', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INDUSTRY', 'INERTIA', 'SUCCESS', 'UNITS']","['strategic change', 'strategic change', 'recovery', 'performance', 'success']",
"In our longitudinal, in-depth case study of strategic change within the National Health Service in England, we compare three practices related to contracting health care services. Contrary to what we would have believed from the extant literature, we found that the most profound change did not emerge in practices that witnessed the greatest increase in the quantity of resources or in which change agents were given the highest degree of control. Instead, change emerged in a practice that was not treated as a priority and that subsequently attracted interest from a very limited number of individuals. Our findings contribute to the resourcing literature by showing that the ability to use resources is shaped by how they are valued and distributed, and that strategic change initiatives can act as triggers for resource revaluations and redistributions. Specifically, we demonstrate that strategic change initiatives may contribute to the emergence of favorable conditions for change in practices that do not become associated with valued resources. This is because a lack of valued resources attracts limited interest from stakeholders, thereby allowing changes to emerge as powerful agents face minimal coordination costs and scrutiny when attempting to align arrangements with their own interests. Our study thereby shows how and why change initiatives can trigger divergent developments across multiple practices and lead to change emergence in unexpected places. It also highlights the role of what we call resourcing space in contributing to emergent change.","['nanSOCIAL POSITION', 'LEADERSHIP', 'VALUES', 'SPACES', 'MODEL', 'FIELD', 'POWER']",['power'],emergence
"Organizations are becoming relentless in managing and developing their key talent. This is a view, however, largely based on anecdote rather than reliable empirical evidence. Utilizing data from 260 multinational enterprises (MNEs), this paper helps redress this deficit. Specifically, this paper explores the extent to which MNEs engage in global talent management (GTM) and deciphers some of the factors which may explain the use and non-use of GTM practices. In so doing, we find that although a significant number of MNEs have systems and mechanisms in place to strategically identify and develop their talent many more seemingly adopt an ad hoc or haphazard approach. For instance, less than half of all MNEs have both global succession planning and formal management development programs for their high-potentials. Consequently it seems that there is a considerable distance yet to be travelled to arrive at a universal appreciation of the need to strategically manage one's key employees. We find the size of the MNE has a significant effect on GTM system usage larger MNEs are more likely to undertake GTM. Other significant, positive influences include whether products or services are standardized regionally or globally, and if the MNE has a global human resources policy formation body. Of considerable interest is the finding that MNEs operating in the low-tech/low-cost sectors are significantly more likely to have formal global systems to identify and develop high-potentials.

"Based on primary data spanning 5 years, we examine factors that influence the entry-level placement of marketing doctoral candidates at U.S. universities and colleges. Contributing to the emerging research on human brands, we identify marketing doctoral candidates' intrinsic and extrinsic brand cues that influence their number of AMA interviews, campus visit offers, and starting base salary. The strongest brand cue is the research productivity of candidates' doctoral degree-granting departments. A related cue that also predicts initial salary is the candidates' advisors' research record. Further, when beginning the job search, doctoral students who have a top research publication, who have a dissertation proposal defended with data, and who have attended the AMA-Sheth Foundation Doctoral Consortium receive a substantial entry salary premium. Based on branding frameworks and theories of academic rewards, this study adds to the emerging knowledge on both the concept of human brands as well as the growing literature on issues relating to marketing academia.","['Academic placement', 'Doctoral education', 'Human brand', 'Extrinsic cues', 'Intrinsic cues', 'Cumulative advantage', 'Universalism', 'Perceived qualityPRODUCT QUALITY', 'JOURNALS', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'EXTENSIONS', 'STRATEGIES', 'ALLIANCES', 'EXCHANGE', 'PRESTIGE', 'COMPANY', 'SIGNALS']","['human brand', 'human brand']",human brands productivity job search
"This article considers the evolution of interfirm networks within a context of technological change. More specifically, it studies the evolution of structural and positional embeddedness in a network of technology-based alliances when it moves from an early period of invention creation to a subsequent period of new product development and commercialization. Empirically, we study the evolution of technology-based alliance networks in the biopharmaceutical industry over a period of about 25 years, from 1975 until 1999. Examining interorganizational networks over such an extended time period allows us to move beyond more static approaches that have characterized most network studies until now, and consider network evolution along its various phases of birth, growth, and early maturation instead. Our findings indicate that the evolution of both structural and positional embeddedness does not follow the common idea of a path of linear progression, but instead strongly exhibits nonlinearity by resembling a sigmoid pattern. These findings have a number of implications. First, the break in the process of linear progression contrasts with the standing literature that (implicitly) assumes the informational and resource value of a network structure to remain constant over time or to evolve linearly from carrying low value to progressively higher value. Instead, our finding that the evolution of structural and positional embeddedness is nonlinear echoes the speculative idea, as expressed by Gulati and Garguilo, that network change may possibly be nonlinear when seen over the long run. A second implication concerns the validity of standing insights from the social network literature such as Coleman's theory of social capital and Burt's theory of structural holes. These theories may not apply to the extent that there are strong changes in environmental conditions like environmental uncertainty and/or munificence, such as during a transition phase as considered in this study.","['nanINTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'OPEN INNOVATION', 'PATTERNS', 'BIOTECHNOLOGY', 'DISCONTINUITIES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'GOVERNANCE', 'DETERMINANTS']","['product development', 'product development']",
"This paper highlights the venture capital investor (VC) portfolios of startups, and explores how the portfolios evolve. We emphasize the important trade-off between broadening and reinforcing VC portfolios (i.e., expanding to new VCs versus relying on existing VCs). This is because, to startups, new and existing VCs generate very different opportunities and constraints. Focusing on the social structure of existing VCs, we argue that startups are more likely to opt for new VCs when the internal networks of existing VCs are denser, when the external networks of existing VCs are smaller, and when the status of existing VCs is lower. Additionally, we not only focus on whether new VCs are on board, but also pay attention to which new VCs are introduced, by analyzing the ex-ante embeddedness between existing and newly-introduced VCs. We stress that when new VCs are highly embedded with existing VCs, their involvement makes only a limited contribution to broadening a startup's portfolio and network. We test the hypotheses using a sample of VC financing rounds in the U.S. and find broad support.","['nanPARTNER SELECTION', 'MARKET UNCERTAINTY', 'NETWORKS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FRIENDS', 'TIES', 'ENTREPRENEURS', 'SYNDICATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'STRANGERS']","['networks', 'ties']",venture capital portfolios networks involvement
"Using a mixed-methods approach, the current research examines online incivility in relation to service recovery on social media. First, findings from a netnographic investigation suggest consumer-to-consumer (C2C) incivility results in some consumers holding the firm accountable to address uncivil exchanges on a firm-managed communication channel. Based on the netnographic findings, fairness theory, and justice theory, a follow-up experimental study assesses how online incivility negatively affects service recovery outcomes (firm consumer justice) when a firm chooses (not) to respond to the incivility. Through these two studies, the current paper proposes a new form of justice (C2C interactional justice) and posits that online service recovery extends beyond direct victims of the incivility (first-party justice) to also include observers (third-party justice). This more nuanced view of justice associated with a service recovery is especially significant when considering the traditional relationships of justice with satisfaction, loyalty, positive word-of-mouth, and other desirable firm outcomes. For practitioners, this research suggests that firms must manage C2C interactional justice on corporate social media channels for both complainants and observers to avoid reputational damage and a loss of customers.

"Achieving employee adherence to organizational rules and policies is critical for successful coordination and functioning within organizations. In this article, we explore the antecedents of such rule-following behavior and present two studies of employees that compare two strategies for achieving rule and policy adherence: (1) an extrinsically oriented command-and-control model and (2) an intrinsically oriented self-regulatory model. The findings of both studies suggest that the influence of the self-regulatory strategy exceeds that of the command-and-control approach. Overall, these studies highlight the potential value of fostering employee rule following via intrinsically oriented self-regulatory mechanisms and suggest strategies for implementing such mechanisms.","['nanAGENCY THEORY PERSPECTIVE', 'SOCIAL-CONTROL', 'DETERRENCE', 'LAW', 'ENFORCEMENT', 'BEHAVIOR', 'MODEL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'COMMITMENT', 'LEGITIMACY']","['behavior', 'model']",and control model
"Because of modern digital technologies, business environments are turning into digital ecosystems, wherein a firm's traditional interdependencies are increasingly influenced by digital connectivity. For legacy firms, or firms yet to incorporate these technologies into their business models, this shift ushers in new opportunities for value creation, albeit through new capabilities. In this article, we focus on how legacy firms can embrace digital ecosystems to create value through a new capability: digital customer orientation. We define digital customer orientation as offering customized and enriched customer experiences made possible by embracing digital ecosystems. We develop a framework for legacy firms to develop capabilities for digital customer orientation in three steps: (1) by distilling key insights on how digital natives such as Amazon, Google and Facebook leverage their digital ecosystems for digital customer orientation; (2) by showing how legacy firms can apply those insights to harness their digital ecosystems and develop their own approaches for digital customer orientation; and (3) by offering a road map and a research agenda for legacy firms to engage in digital customer orientation-both by highlighting the organizational attributes needed, and by framing those attributes within the principles of transformative marketing.","['Digital ecosystems', 'Digital customer orientation', 'PlatformsMARKETING CAPABILITIES', 'PRODUCT INNOVATION', 'PLATFORMS', 'STRATEGY', 'EXPLOITATION', 'EXPLORATION', 'LEVEL', 'POWER']","['digital ecosystems', 'digital ecosystems', 'digital customer orientation', 'digital customer orientation', 'digital customer orientation']",digital ecosystems digital customer orientation marketing
"The recognition and development of new opportunities are at the heart of entrepreneurship. Building from Kirzner's (1973, 1999) work, cognition theory, and McMullen and Shepherd's (2006) recent development, we offer a model involving three distinct elements of alertness: scanning and search, association and connection, and evaluation and judgment. We then conduct multiple studies to develop and validate a 13-item alertness scale that captures these three dimensions. Results demonstrate appropriate dimensionality, strong reliability, and content, convergent, discriminant, and nomological validity. The resultant instrument provides researchers with a valuable tool for probing the entrepreneurial opportunity development process including antecedents and outcomes.

"This paper introduces a radically different conceptualization of human capital resources that runs counter to the individual-level approaches that have dominated human capital theory for the last 50 years. We leverage insights from economics, strategy, human resources, and psychology to develop an integrated and holistic framework that defines the structure, function, levels, and combinations of human capital resources. This multidisciplinary framework redefines human capital resources as individual or unit-level capacities based on individual knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) that are accessible for unit-relevant purposes. The framework and definition offer three broad contributions. First, multidisciplinary communication is facilitated by providing precise definitions and distinctions between individual differences, KSAOs, human capital, human capital resources, and strategic human capital resources. Second, given that human capital resources originate in individuals' KSAOs, multiple distinct types of human capital resources exist at individual and collective levels, and these types are much more diverse than the historical generic-specific distinction. Third, the multiple types of human capital resources may be combined within and across levels, via processes of emergence and complementarity. Consequently, the locus of competitive advantage has less to do with whether human capital resources are generic or specific but instead occurs because nearly all human capital resource combinations are complex, are firm-specific, and lack strategic (or efficient) factor markets. Overall, the proposed multidisciplinary framework opens new avenues for future research that challenge the prevailing literature's treatment of human capital resources.","['human capital resources', 'human capital', 'human resources', 'strategy', 'organizational behavior', 'psychologyCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'EMPLOYEE MOBILITY', 'FIRM', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MICROFOUNDATIONS', 'CAPABILITIES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'IMPACT', 'VIEW', 'COMPLEMENTARITIES']","['human capital resources', 'human capital resources', 'human capital resources', 'human capital', 'human capital', 'human resources', 'human resources', 'strategy', 'firm']",knowledge
"Careers are central to our understanding of the knowledge creation dynamics of network organizations. Based on the example of R&D project collaboration between firms and universities, this paper examines the emerging forms of career models that support knowledge flows between organizations. It explores how some large firms in the high-technology sectors have sought to break away from the limitations of internal R&D and firm-based careers for scientists by engaging in external collaborative projects to gain access to the open knowledge networks of university researchers. It examines how the firms seek to forge close institutional ties with their university partners and develop network career structures in order to engage academic scientists in joint knowledge production. It argues that firms have sought to extend their human resource and knowledge boundaries into the established internal labour markets of the universities with which they collaborate, leading to the formation of a pool of joint human resources with work experiences and career patterns straddling the two sectors. The paper develops the concept of an 'overlapping internal labour market' to provide a conceptual bridge between internal labour markets and network organizations.","['nanINNOVATION', 'SCIENCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ECONOMICS', 'FIRMS']",['firms'],organizations firms

"An outsized focus on the explanatory value of conscious thought can constrain opportunities to more rigorously examine the influence of less obvious drivers of consumer behavior. This article proposes a more precise, disaggregated, and minimized perspective on consciousness, distinguishing it from other higher-order mental processes (i.e.,deliberation, intentionality, control, and effort). A more circumscribed perspective on consciousness, we argue, facilitates attempts to examine the causal impact of low-level, biological, or otherwise unconscious influences, bringing these into the frame of inquiry. Accordingly, we outline how a reduced reliance on consciousness as an explanatory construct deepens inquiry into the processes guiding choice, self-control, and persuasion. Lastly, in a set of recommendations centering on theory, methods, and training, we suggest ways for consumer researchers to evaluate more critically whether the contents of consciousness play a meaningful role in driving behavior.","['consciousness', 'biological influences', 'theory building', 'research methods', 'data interpretation', 'trainingSELF-CONTROL', 'UNCONSCIOUS THOUGHT', 'LIFE-HISTORY', 'IMPLEMENTATION INTENTIONS', 'CONTINGENCY AWARENESS', 'NONCONSCIOUS GOALS', 'ATTITUDE FORMATION', 'EARLY EXPERIENCE', 'FREE WILL', 'CHOICE']","['consciousness', 'choice']",self control persuasion

Data from 904 manager-subordinate dyads in six organizations showed that leader expectations were related to employee engagement in learning activities. Goal specificity, goal difficulty, and providing learning opportunities proved to be mediators.

"Do family firms benefit more from a regional or a global geographic scope? We suggest it depends on their family leadership type - family vs non-family leadership. We offer a nuanced view of agency and stewardship theories to hypothesize that family leaders are most beneficial when pursuing a regional strategy (i.e., high home-region focus (HRF)), whereas non-family leaders are more advantageous when pursing a global strategy (i.e., low HRF). Utilizing a sample of 202 Western European firms from 1996 to 2006, we find support for this central hypothesis. Thus family leadership influences the degree to which family firms benefit from HRF.

"This article is critical of monological research accounts that fail to accommodate polyvocal narratives of organizational change, calling for more fully informed case studies that combine elements of a narrative approach with processual/contextual analysis. We illustrate how contrasting versions of the same change event by different stakeholders and by the same stakeholder for different audiences, raise theoretical and methodological issues in the analysis and presentation of data on organizational change. Our argument is that research narratives (that seek to develop understanding of change processes) are necessarily selective and sieved through particular discourses that represent different ways of engaging in research. They are authored in a particular genre and written to influence target audiences who become active co-creators of meaning. Organizational change viewed from this perspective is a multi-story process, in which theoretical accounts and guides to practice are authored consistent with pre-selected narrative styles. These, in turn, are purposefully chosen to influence target audiences, but this subjective crafting is often hidden behind a cloak of putative objectivity in the written and oral presentations of academic research findings.","['nanNARRATIVE APPROACH', 'POLITICS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'SCIENCE', 'SENSE', 'STORY', 'TALES']",['story'],meaning

Using an agent-based simulation model, this paper investigates the effectiveness of effectuation relative to causation in uncertain and risky contexts. The simulation overcomes the shortcomings of think aloud protocols typically used in effectuation research. The results suggest that effectuation outperforms causation in both risky and uncertain contexts until the entrepreneur can predict the future correctly > 75% of the time.

"Unlike their counterparts in developed markets, emerging-market firms are characterized by limited resources, including international experience and access to relevant information, which are essential for developing suitable international marketing strategy (IMS). Under such circumstances, strategies are expected to produce suboptimal results, especially when targeting competitive markets in advanced economies. Prior IMS research has largely focused on developed markets. In contrast, the authors examine IMS of exporters in Thailand, an emerging market. Despite major differences in environments and processes in emerging markets, they establish that Thai exporters that match their IMS to local market conditions realize superior performance, as predicated by strategy coalignment. The authors validate these results and discuss emerging-market firms' capacity to adapt their strategies and succeed in highly competitive advanced economies, despite relative inexperience, volatility, and information asymmetry at home. Exporting remains of critical importance to the economies of emerging markets, and the findings provide greater optimism for their firms' ability to address host-market conditions in their marketing strategies, as well as pointing to the competitive threat posed by these emerging-market neophytes.","['export marketing strategy standardization/adaptation', 'emerging markets', 'ideal profile analysis', 'strategy coalignment', 'ThailandMIMETIC ISOMORPHISM', 'CONVENTIONAL WISDOM', 'BUSINESS STRATEGIES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FIT', 'STANDARDIZATION', 'ADAPTATION', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DETERMINANTS', 'ANTECEDENTS']","['emerging markets', 'emerging markets', 'strategy coalignment', 'strategy coalignment', 'performance']",market international marketing strategy performance

Using an objective measure of customer presence in the boardroom and a sample of 329 B2B firms over a nine-year period, the authors find support for this hypothesis. Moreover, relying on the resource-based view, they hypothesize that the performance benefit of customers in the boardroom is contingent on the value, rarity, inimitability, and organizational fit of customer resources. Specifically, they find that a customer on the board is more effective when demand uncertainty is high but is less effective when the firm is highly diversified. Moreover, a board member who is an independent director of the customer firm is less effective than a board member who is an executive at the customer firm.

We theorize that team design thinking enables NPD teams to develop more innovative products--products that are useful and novel--by reducing the routine and cognition-based inertia that constrains the team's innovativeness. Through a study of 247 NPD projects, we investigate the relationships between team design thinking, product utility, and product novelty. Further, we also explore whether the team's unfamiliarity with product contexts influences these relationships. Findings show that team design thinking is positively associated with useful products in both familiar and unfamiliar contexts, but that team design thinking is associated with product novelty only in familiar contexts. Findings also suggest that team design thinking can be framed as a dynamic capability that addresses routine and cognition-based inertia by expanding the organization's knowledge resource base, particularly in familiar contexts. A key implication of this research is that team design thinking will influence product utility in a variety of situations, but its influence on product novelty will be evident primarily in familiar contexts.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL ROUTINES', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'REQUISITE VARIETY', 'INDUSTRIAL-DESIGN', 'BOUNDARY OBJECTS', 'INERTIA', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'PERSPECTIVE']","['inertia', 'knowledge']",cognition
"Research Summary: A firm's stakeholder orientation toward its employees is argued to be beneficial for firm outcomes. However, this orientation may also have disparate impacts on particular behaviors and outcomes, such as local versus distant search, which impose contradictory firm requirements. We find that while a strong firm-employee relationship leads to increasingly higher levels of local search (exploitation), it also leads to increasingly lower levels of distant search (exploration). In additional supplementary analyses, we find similar disparate effects on the productivity of innovation and its market value, as well as a moderating effect of the firm's relationship with other stakeholders which exacerbates both the positive and negative impacts of firm-employee relationships. We discuss the implications of these findings for both the innovation and the instrumental stakeholder literatures. Managerial Summary: Motivating employees toward generating new ideas and innovations is an important challenge for most firms. Establishing the firm as a trustful and good partner for employees may engender in them the commitment and willingness to invest in such activities. However, questions remain as to how well the firm should treat its employees, and the potential adverse consequences from over-investing in such relationships. This paper examines these important practical questions and finds that establishing strong relationships with employees can be simultaneously beneficial and harmful for the firm depending on the type of new ideas it seeks. We find that such strong relationships helps with motivating employees to build on and perfect existing knowledge, but is harmful with respect to bringing in new and unfamiliar knowledge.","['firm-employee relationship', 'innovation', 'local versus distant search', 'patenting', 'stakeholder theoryCORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'CONSTRUCT-VALIDITY', 'SLACK', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'DIMENSIONS', 'BEHAVIOR']","['firm employee relationship', 'firm employee relationship', 'firm employee relationship', 'innovation', 'local versus distant search', 'local versus distant search', 'local versus distant search', 'local versus distant search', 'behavior']",search exploration innovation
"Researchers often struggle when applying golden rules of thumb' to evaluate structural equation models. This paper questions the notion of universal thresholds and calls for adjusted orientation points that account for sample size, factor loadings, the number of latent variables and indicators, as well as data (non-)normality. This research explores the need for flexible cutoffs and their accuracy in single- and two-index strategies. Study 1 reveals that many indices are biased; thus, rigid cutoffs can become imprecise. Flexible cutoff values are shown to compensate for the unique distorting patterns and prove to be particularly beneficial for moderate misspecification. Study 2 sheds further light on this gray' area of misspecification and disentangles the different sources of misspecification. Study 3 finally investigates the performance of flexible cutoffs for non-normal data. Having substantiated higher performance for flexible reference values, this paper provides to managers an easy-to-use tool that facilitates the determination of adequate cutoffs.","['Structural equation modeling', 'Fit indices', 'Cutoff values', 'Monte Carlo simulation', 'Accuracy', 'Flexible cutoff valuesGOODNESS-OF-FIT', 'CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS', 'SAMPLE-SIZE', 'CHI-SQUARE', 'IMPROPER SOLUTIONS', 'TEST STATISTICS', 'MONTE-CARLO', 'COVARIANCE', 'SENSITIVITY', 'ERROR']","['cutoff values', 'cutoff values', 'accuracy', 'sample size', 'sample size']",models misspecification
"Although marketing researchers agree that brand authenticity has various meanings, little consensus exists concerning the number of meanings and what those meanings entail. This paper addresses this lack of clarity in the literature by introducing the Entity-Referent Correspondence (ERC) Framework of Authenticity. The ERC Framework provides an overarching definition of authenticity-a consumer's perception of the degree to which a supposed authenticentity corresponds withor is true to something else, which we label areferent. The ERC Framework also suggests three types of authenticity-true-to-ideal,true-to-fact, andtrue-to-self-that are consistent with the general definition yet are distinct. Each type may manifest in a variety of ways in a brand context, suggesting that brand authenticity is not a singular concept. The framework also proposes nomological nets that explain how consumers form perceptions of each type, how the types lead to managerially relevant outcomes (e.g., expected quality, trust), and how the types affect each other. This research advances the literature on brand authenticity by offering three types of conceptual contributions as identified by MacInnis (2011):integrating,differentiating, anddelineating.","['Brand authenticity', 'Authenticity', 'Truth', 'True-to-ideal', 'True-to-fact', 'True-to-selfSELF-DETERMINATION THEORY', 'CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS', 'MARKET-RESEARCH', 'TRUST', 'CATEGORIZATION', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'CULTURE', 'QUALITY', 'PASSION', 'MEMORY']","['brand authenticity', 'brand authenticity', 'authenticity', 'true to ideal', 'true to ideal', 'true to ideal', 'true to fact', 'true to fact', 'true to fact', 'trust', 'quality']",brand authenticity entity referent correspondence framework

Extending this body of research, we theorize how affective valence and affective activation work together to impact opportunity identification. We emphasize that to understand affective influences, both valence and activation should be included because they each influence active search effort and knowledge integration. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our study and suggest that future research should include more dynamic relationships among affect and entrepreneurial outcomes.","['nanDISPOSITIONAL POSITIVE AFFECT', 'AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCE', 'REGULATORY FOCUS', 'RISK-TAKING', 'MOOD', 'ENTREPRENEURS', 'EMOTIONS', 'INFORMATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CREATIVITY']",['entrepreneurs'],opportunity identification search
"This paper explains, through a field study and from an agency perspective, how monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms change to support the interests of a privatized firm's new ownership. In this case, privatization led to important changes in the board of directors and to more formal performance evaluation and compensation systems for top managers, as profitability and financial control gained relevancy with the firm ownership change. Our results show that differences in incentives management before and after privatization are due to different agency relations in the two periods. We also argue that in a privatization framework the relation between monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms is complex, not simply substitutive as agency theory would predict, and this finding allows us to refine and extend agency theory for this specific context.","['nanFIRM PERFORMANCE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'STATE ENTERPRISES', 'WATER INDUSTRY', 'EXECUTIVE PAY', 'COMPENSATION', 'OWNERSHIP', 'SYSTEMS', 'DIVERSIFICATION']","['compensation', 'ownership', 'systems']",privatization
"Studies have shown positive associations between liking a Facebook brand page and brand evaluations, but causal evidence is lacking. This online pre-post-measure experiment compared brand evaluations of 'current followers' of a target brand's Facebook page, with 'new followers' instructed to 'like' the page, and 'non-followers' over one month. Results showed a significant positive increase for new followers on brand evaluations, whereas non-followers showed no change. Current followers were most positive in evaluations overall, but showed no change over time. This provides evidence that following a brand's Facebook updates can cause positive changes in brand evaluations. The effects were explained by perceived conversational human voice, indicating the importance of brand interactivity. Implications for brands' social media presence are discussed.

"To support managerial practice and help improve analytical models in retailing, this article extends the literature on processes in the psychological chain of effects from perceived quality to customer loyalty by making three original and fundamental contributions. Based on multilevel structural equation modeling of consumer data from Bolivia, Japan, and the USA, it shows that product beliefs mediate this chain of effects and that cross-over effects connect rational and emotional processes within this chain. Moreover, it elucidates conditions moderating the strength of these emotional and rational processes. Breadth of experience positively moderates the mediating role of product beliefs. Relative price positively moderates the effect of hedonic product beliefs on affective customer satisfaction and negatively moderates the effect of utilitarian product beliefs on cognitive customer satisfaction. Time since purchase positively moderates the role of emotional processes and negatively moderates the role of rational processes. The moderating effects of sensory, affective, and intellectual brand experience support the predictive validity of the research model. Further analyses illuminate how social recognition, customer value co-creation through product usage patterns, and product-service bundling affect product beliefs, as well as how affective and cognitive customer satisfaction influence positive word-of-mouth.

"Previous research on attribute framing has shown that people often infer higher quantity from larger numbers, usually with the assumption that the units used to specify this information elicit the same meanings. Drawing on literature on categorization and numerical cognition, the authors challenge this assumption and show that consumers often have preset units for attribute levels that strike an optimal balance between a preference for small numbers and the need for accuracy (study 1a). As such, these default units appear commonly (study 1b). Specifying positive attributes in default units renders products' evaluation more favorable, even if such specification lowers the nominal value of the attributes (studies 2-4). This effect disappears if participants attribute metacognitive feelings generated by default units to an irrelevant source (study 3). Study 5 shows that a default unit effect is more likely in single evaluation mode, but a numerosity effect may reemerge in joint evaluations.","['nanPSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE', 'METACOGNITIVE DIFFICULTY', 'PREFERENCE REVERSALS', 'SEPARATE EVALUATIONS', 'PERCEPTUAL FLUENCY', 'PROCESSING FLUENCY', 'NUMBER LINE', 'CONSUMER', 'JUDGMENTS', 'DIGIT']",['consumer'],attribute framing categorization
"The term entrepreneurial orientation has been used to refer to the strategy-making processes and styles of firms that engage in entrepreneurial activities. A popular model of entrepreneurial entrepreneurial orientation (EO) suggests that there are five dimensions of EO-autonomy, innovativeness, risk taking proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness (Lumpkin and Dess 1996). This paper reports on two of those dimensions-proactiveness and competitive aggressiveness. Proactiveness refers to how firms relate to market opportunities by seizing initiative in the marketplace; competitive aggressiveness refers to how firms react to competitive trends and demands that already exist in the marketplace. Despite these distinctions, prior research has tended to equate these two concepts and argued that they have a similar effect on firm performance. This paper investigates how these two approaches are related to each other, how they are related to performance, and how their function differs in the environments in which firms exhibit these approaches to strategy making. These distinctions are important because proactiveness and competitive aggressiveness represent distinctly different avenues to entrepreneurial success. A field study was conducted in which 124 executives from 94 firms were surveyed. These were executives from non-affiliated, non-diversified firms who were actively involved in strategic decision making at the top level of the firm. All firms reporting had at least one respondent who was an owner; Analysis of the data was conducted in two phases. In phase I, factor analysis was rued to examine the distinctions between different dimensions of EO. Proactiveness and competitive aggressiveness emerged as two separate factors indicating that these two strategy-making modes were perceived differently by the executives in the study. In the second phase, the relationship of these two dimensions to performance was analyzed in various contexts. Initial tests found that proactiveness was positively related to performance but competitive aggressiveness tended to be poorly associated with performance. Subsequent tests of the EO-performance relationship indicated that the stage of industry life cycle tended to favor one entrepreneurial orientation over another. The performance of firms in the early stages of industry development was stronger when their. strategy making was proactively oriented. In contrast a competitively aggressive frame of mind was helpful to firms in more mature stages industry development. These findings were supported by other tests of the business environment. In dynamic environments, characterized by rapid change and uncertainty, proactive firms had higher performance relative to competitively aggressive firms. In hostile environments, where competition is intense and resources are con strained, competitively aggressive firms had stronger performance. The findings suggest that these two different approaches to entrepreneurial decision making may have different effects on firm performance. The differences were particularly apparent in the way firms relate to their external environment. Proactiveness-a response to opportunities-is an appropriate mode for firms in dynamic environments or in growth stage industries where conditions are rapidly changing and opportunities for advancement are numerous. But such environments may nor favor the kind of combative posturing typical of competitive aggressiveness. Firms in hostile environments, or in mature industries where competition for customers and resources is intense, are more likely to benefit from competitive aggressiveness-a response to threats. A further implication of this research is that the dimensions of an entrepreneurial orientation, often considered to be positively related to performance under all conditions, may not always be associated with successful outcomes. This study indicates that the dimensions of EO often vary independently rather than covary, suggesting that the extent to which an entrepreneurial approach to strategy making is useful will frequently depend on the organizational or environmental conditions under which such decisions are made.

"To guide new product forecasting efforts, the following study offers preliminary data on new product forecasting practices during the commercialization stage (prelaunch and launch stage). Data on department responsibility for and involvement in the new product forecasting process, technique usage, forecast accuracy, and forecast time horizon across different types of new products are reported. Comparisons of new product forecasting practices for consumer firms versus industrial firms are also reported. Overall, study results show that the marketing department is predominantly responsible for the new product forecasting effort, there is a preference to employ judgmental forecasting techniques, forecast accuracy is 58% on average across the different types of new products, and two to four forecasting techniques are typically employed during the new product forecasting effort. Compared to consumer firms, industrial firms appear to have longer forecast time horizons and rely more on the sales force for new product forecasting. Additional analyses show that there does not appear to be a general relationship between a particular department's involvement and higher forecast accuracy or greater satisfaction, nor does it appear that use of a particular technique relates to higher forecast accuracy and greater satisfaction. Countering previous research findings, the number of forecasting techniques employed also does not appear to correlate to higher forecasting accuracy or greater satisfaction.

"Driven by the proliferation of augmented reality (AR) technologies, many firms are pursuing a strategy of service augmentation to enhance customers' online service experiences. Drawing on situated cognition theory, the authors show that AR-based service augmentation enhances customer value perceptions by simultaneously providing simulated physical control and environmental embedding. The resulting authentic situated experience, manifested in a feeling of spatial presence, functions as a mediator and also predicts customer decision comfort. Furthermore, the effect of spatial presence on utilitarian value perceptions is greater for customers who are disposed toward verbal rather than visual information processing, and the positive effect on decision comfort is attenuated by customers' privacy concerns.","['Augmented reality', 'Online service experience', 'Service marketing strategy', 'Situated cognition', 'Spatial presenceSPATIAL PRESENCE', 'SELF-SERVICE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL FRONTLINES', 'MENTAL SIMULATION', 'RESEARCH AGENDA', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'PRODUCT', 'MODEL', 'INFORMATION', 'COGNITION']","['augmented reality', 'augmented reality', 'online service experience', 'online service experience', 'online service experience', 'situated cognition', 'situated cognition', 'information', 'cognition']",augmented reality service augmentation cognition customer value perceptions spatial presence customer decision comfort privacy
"Research Summary Strategic management has come to pay more attention to value creation and appropriation (VCA) among the firm's stakeholders, including customers, capital owners, and employees. Existing research has conceptualized this as a strategic choice bounded by the bargaining power of each stakeholder group, which, we argue, risks misattributing outcomes by neglecting structural constraints. Instead, these dynamics need to be understood within the wider institutional context shaping the behavior of managers and stakeholders. Using a question-driven mixed-methods approach, we investigate the evolution of VCA in three telecom companies located in different institutional systems-British Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, and Telecom Italia. Our findings suggest that national institutional and firm strategic effects must be considered together to understand patterns of VCA among stakeholders. Managerial Summary Using an emerging methodology, we quantify how three telecom firms (British Telecom, Deutsche Telecom, and Telecom Italia) have created and distributed economic value since privatization. Our focus is on explaining the extent to which various stakeholders-employees, customers, capital owners, and government-were able to appropriate the value created by the firms. Some similarities are found across the three companies, but we also found major differences. To explain patterns, we bring together (a) strategic decision making by managers within the firm and (b) constraints imposed by institutions outside the firm. We find both to be important, interlinked drivers of distributional patterns. The article gives managers and stakeholders a means to understand major changes and determinants of value creation and distribution.","['institutions', 'stakeholders', 'value appropriation', 'value creation', 'VCA modelCORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'BRITISH-TELECOM', 'CAPITALISM', 'GLOBALIZATION', 'MODEL']","['institutions', 'stakeholders', 'value creation', 'value creation', 'british telecom', 'british telecom']",value creation and appropriation stakeholders privatization
"I examine how firms use alliances to respond to the alliance networks of their rivals, by either allying with their rivals' partners or by building countervailing alliances. Evidence from the global airline industry (1994-98) suggests that these strategic responses depend on alliance cospecialization. Cospecialized alliances by rivals may involve exclusivity, precluding alliances with the rivals' partners and thus encouraging countervailing alliances. Nonspecialized alliances are less exclusive and are used when rivals share the same partners.","['nanSTRATEGIC GROUPS', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS', 'CREDIBLE COMMITMENTS', 'MOBILITY BARRIERS', 'INTERFIRM RIVALRY', 'SOCIAL-STRUCTURE', 'INDUSTRY', 'COOPERATION', 'DYNAMICS']",['industry'],alliances airline industry
"This study examined the association between corporations' environments, strategies, and past performance and the composition of their boards of directors as measured by size and outside director representation. The environment, strategy and past performance were viewed as posing a strategic contingency; each of these sets could determine the success or failure of the company. Data on 119 Fortune 500 industrial companies for the 1983-9 period were used. Canonical analysis showed that increased uncertainty of a firm's environment, use of external growth and diversification; reliance on leverage as a means of finance, and poor past financial performance were associated with large board size and increased outside representation in subsequent years.

"The current research offers a new theoretical perspective on the relationship between power and persuasion. An agentic-communal model of power is presented that proposes power affects both the messages generated by communicators and the messages that persuade audiences. Compared to low-power states, highpower states produce a greater emphasis on information that conveys competence. As a consequence, high-power communicators generate messages with greater competence information, and high-power audiences are persuaded more by competence information. In contrast to high-power states, low-power states produce a greater emphasis on information that conveys warmth. As a result, lowpower communicators generate messages with greater warmth information, and low-power audiences are persuaded more by warmth information. Because of these two outcomes, a power-matching effect occurs between communicator and audience power: high-power communicators are more effective in persuading high-power audience members, whereas low-power communicators are more effective in persuading low-power audience members. Four experiments find support for these effects in oral and written contexts with three distinct manipulations of power. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that the persuasiveness of messages can be affected by the alignment between the psychological sense of power of the communicator and the audience.","['power', 'persuasion', 'agentic-communal', 'warmth', 'competenceSOCIAL-CLASS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'ATTITUDE', 'SELF', 'ORIENTATION', 'COMPLEMENTARITY', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'INHIBITION', 'DIMENSIONS', 'EXPERIENCE']","['power', 'persuasion', 'agentic communal', 'agentic communal', 'warmth']",persuasion
"We examine the link between international diversification, organizational knowledge resources, and subsidiary performance. The success of international corporate diversification depends on a firm's capability to transfer knowledge to its subsidiaries, and how its local subsidiaries effectively utilize that knowledge. As knowledge resources are imperfectly mobile, a firm may find it difficult to transfer knowledge to its subsidiaries. In our analysis of 4964 Japanese subsidiaries over a 14-year period, we find that knowledge that is valuable, but not rare, positively affects subsidiary performance in the short term, but not the long term. In contrast, knowledge that is both valuable and rare affects subsidiary performance in the long term, but not the short term.

"Using a novel approach with video-recordings of sales interactions, this study focuses on a dynamic analysis of salesperson effectiveness in handling customer queries. We conceptualize salesperson behaviors, namely, resolving, relating, and emoting, as separate elements of customer query handling and empirically identify the distinct verbal and nonverbal cues that salespeople use to display these behaviors during sales interactions. We draw from compensation effects in social cognition theory to propose that customers' perceptions of a salesperson's effectiveness are prone to trade-offs between competence (resolving behaviors) and warmth (relating and emoting behaviors). Results, robust to endogeneity corrections, support the proposed tradeoffs such that the effectiveness of salesperson's resolving behavior is significantly curtailed, even neutralized, by the salesperson's relating and emoting behaviors. We situate these counterintuitive results within the extant theory and research on sales interactions, and outline implications for practice.","['Customer query handling', 'Customer interest', 'Salesperson behaviors', 'Linguistic cues', 'Dynamic effectsRELATIONSHIP QUALITY', 'NONVERBAL-COMMUNICATION', 'INFLUENCE TACTICS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'IMPACT', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SALESPEOPLE', 'INSURANCE', 'SELLER']","['customer query handling', 'customer query handling', 'customer query handling', 'salesperson behaviors', 'salesperson behaviors', 'behavior', 'salespeople']",

"For the past decade, project organization has become increasingly central to management and organization studies, particularly as these seek to discern the contours of post-modern organizations. Yet, these contours frequently seem to be sighted without bearings on the current realities of project management. In this paper we take such bearings, using data derived from detailed qualitative, ethnographic enquiry into the experience of project management. From this data we construct the contours of project management more sharply. Rather than being a harbinger of an autonomous and more democratic future, free from extant bureaucratic organization controls, we find that project management has distinct modalities of control that we outline in the paper: reputational, calculative, and professional. Indeed, rather than foreshadowing a future transformational form, we find traces of a much older design: that of de Tocqueville.","['nanINTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION', 'NETWORKS', 'CULTURE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'FIRMS', 'POWER', 'FORM']",['form'],organization
"Past research studies on service failures and recovery have conceptualized voice in terms of customers having an opportunity to air complaints after failures occur In contrast, the authors introduce the concept of recovery voice, which entails a service provider asking a customer (after a failure has occurred) what the firm can do to rectify the problem. In a scenario-based experiment carried out in an airline setting and in a hotel setting with 216 and 208 participants, respectively, it was found that customers perceived greater procedural justice when offered recovery voice, which resulted in higher overall postfailure satisfaction. It was shown that perceived procedural justice mediated the effect of recovery voice on overall satisfaction. Furthermore, recovery voice had a greater impact on perceived procedural justice for established customers with long transaction histories than for new ones with short transaction histories.

"The process of new venture creation is central to the field of entrepreneurship. The effects of initial organizing have a direct influence on survival, yet empirical examination of the dimensions of emergent organizations is limited. Using longitudinal data on nascent entrepreneurs, this paper empirically tests four properties of emerging organizations-intentionality, resources, boundary and exchange- and their effect on likelihood of continued organizing [Katz, J., Gartner, W.B., 1988. Properties of emerging organizations. Academy of Management Review 13(3), 429-441]. Our results suggest that all four properties are necessary for firm survival in the short-term and those firms that organize more slowly are more likely to continue to organize. Further, nascent ventures in which intentionality preceded the other organizing properties were not significantly more likely to continue in the organizing effort. Our results suggest an extension of the original Katz and Gartner [Katz, J., Gartner, W.B., 1988. Properties of emerging organizations. Academy of Management Review 13(3), 429-441] framework.

"There is agreement among ecology researchers that the concepts of legitimation and competition are partly responsible for organizational selection. Finding adequate measures to represent these concepts, however, has been elusive and has been the main obstacle to the development of this stream of investigation. On the basis of the germinal density dependence model, we identify two lines of research, which have generated seven distinct models. This survey shows that there has been a general tendency to use only three variables to measure legitimation and competition, which are often measured together. However, we argue that fruitful results have emerged when efforts have been made to separate both concepts and that there is some potential in using new measures (mass or concentration) which have so far only found limited application in the field of population demography. These findings, together with the inconclusive results of this stream of research, allow us to identify the existing gaps in the literature and comment on directions for future research.","['nanAMERICAN BREWING INDUSTRY', 'DENSITY-DEPENDENCE', 'WINE INDUSTRY', 'AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS', 'POPULATION-DYNAMICS', 'MORTALITY', 'ECOLOGY', 'EVOLUTION', 'FAILURE', 'RATES']","['density dependence', 'density dependence', 'ecology']",ecology selection density dependence demography
"In today's marketplace, many of the newer-generation convergence products (e.g., camera phones, all-in-one personal digital assistants) offer consumers product performance that rivals dedicated versions. With the increased availability of options, consumers now face another dilemma in their purchase consideration: Which product form should they choose-converged, dedicated, or both? This study investigates the choice patterns for product forms along the technology trajectories. In a series of four studies, the authors find that at low levels of technological performance, consumers overwhelmingly select convergence products over the dedicated options, whereas the choice pattern is reversed at high levels of technological performance. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that a preannouncement of future technology can affect consumer preferences for product forms. Finally, they address the managerial implications and suggest directions for further research.","['digital convergence', 'technology trajectory', 'intercategory choice', 'product bundling', 'dilution effectFEATURE FATIGUE', 'MODEL', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'INNOVATION', 'ADOPTION', 'EVOLUTION', 'DEMAND', 'CHOICE', 'MARKET']","['choice', 'market']",

"Over the past decade, the world has been contending with a growing set of challenges related to illicit traffic as advancements in technology, communications, and global integration facilitate the operation of black markets and greater organization of criminal activity. In this study, the dark web and associated dark net markets are introduced as an important context for scholars interested in international marketing. Furthermore, the scale, scope, and structure of the real-world drug trade is empirically analyzed as an example of the work possible within this dark world. The study concludes by highlighting key themes from the literature in international marketing scholarship and focuses on how they might be co-opted to contribute toward the understanding and countermarketing of illicit systems of exchange.","['black markets', 'dark web', 'illicit trade', 'international trade', 'social network analysisPIRACY', 'IMPACT', 'SALES']","['black markets', 'black markets', 'dark web', 'dark web']",dark web dark net
"This research fills a gap in the retailing literature regarding the impact of shoppers' perceptions of being watched while shopping for embarrassing products. Four studies consistently show that an employee watching a shopper can cause the shopper to either permanently or temporarily leave the shopping area as purchase intentions decrease. Reactance theory explains this relationship, which is mediated by consumers' feelings of control over their own privacy. Essentially, when shoppers believe an employee is watching them, they feel less in control of their privacy, resulting in negative consequences for the retailer. This relationship is especially important for products that consumers may already feel some level of embarrassment over purchasing in the first place. The results have important theoretical implications for reactance theory by demonstrating that a consumer can regain control even when the original threat to behavior still exists. Additionally, increasing options that allow a consumer to regain control will reduce the overall reactance to the threat to privacy and will improve retailer outcomes. Practitioner recommendations present several techniques that allow the consumer to regain privacy control in spite of the sometimes necessary practice of watching in-store consumers.

"Gratitude is a valuable emotion with an array of functional outcomes. Nonetheless, research on gratitude in organizations is limited. In this article we develop a multi-level model of gratitude composed of episodic gratitude at the event level, persistent gratitude at the individual level, and collective gratitude at the organizational level. We then consider the types of human resource initiatives that organizations can develop to cultivate employee gratitude and the contingencies of gratitude's emergence at the individual and organizational levels of analysis. Finally, we elucidate the benefits of gratitude for organizations and their employees. The result is a deeper understanding of how gratitude unfolds in organizations and the role that organizations themselves can play in influencing emotions at multiple levels in the workplace.","['nanCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'DEVELOPMENTAL FEEDBACK', 'CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'EXPRESSING GRATITUDE', 'WORK', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EMOTION', 'COMPASSION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MOOD']","['work', 'emotion']",gratitude
"This study applies the justice theory to address interpartner cooperation in strategic alliances. It emphasizes how procedural fairness as perceived by boundary spanners in these alliances influences cooperation outcomes. We theorize that procedural fairness improves cooperation results through enhancing relational value and curtailing relational risk in an environment characterized by both economic and social exchange. Our path analysis suggests that procedural fairness has a direct effect on operational outcome, but an indirect effect on financial outcome via increased trust driven by fairness. Procedural fairness contributes more to performance outcomes when strategic alliances are equity joint ventures than if they are contractual agreements. Theoretical and managerial implications arising from the findings are highlighted.

"Analyzes four entities in a connected supply chain through a case study. Focuses on the relationships between organizations and the specific goals and objectives of each firm. The study was conducted from an insider's view through personal experiences, and a series of on-site and telephone interviews with managers from each entity of the supply chain. Focuses on passing on and interpreting quality goals, alignment of quality goals and the existence of partnership with the connected supply chain. The main reason for the success of the supply chain is the strength or dominance of the manufacturer. Strong and frequent unidirectional communication exists between the manufacturer and the supplier and between the manufacturer and the distributor. These connections are the crux of the supply chain. From this strong relationship, the supply chain is able to remain successful while communication weakens and disappears at either end of the supply chain.","['case studies', 'supply chain management', 'quality', 'communicationMANAGEMENT']",['quality'],
"To counter the negative effects of a product-harm crisis, brands hope to capitalize on their equity, and often use advertising as a communication device to regain customers' lost trust. We study how consumer characteristics and advertising influence consumers' first-purchase decisions for two affected brands of peanut butter following a severe Australian product-harm crisis. Both pre-crisis loyalty and familiarity are found to form an important buffer against the product-harm crisis, although this resilience decreases over time. Also heavy users tend to purchase the affected brands sooner, unless their usage rate decreased significantly during the crisis. Brand advertising was found to be effective for the stronger brand, but not for the weaker brand.","['product-harm crises', 'brand equity', 'advertising', 'multiple-event hazard modelMODERATING ROLE', 'CONSUMER RESPONSE', 'SEGMENTATION', 'REPUTATION', 'MODELS', 'IMPACT', 'SALES']",['advertising'],product harm crisis familiarity
"This study proposes a typology of reasons why people substantially delay important consumer decisions. The delay reasons we study are drawn from delay typologies identified in other contexts as well as from the product diffusion literature. Two studies reported here examine why subjects delay consumer decisions. These support most of the reasons in the proposed typology, while some unanticipated delay reasons also emerge. We find that the delay reasons are related to the reasons consumers stop delaying, a process that we call delay closure, and are also related to the amount of time that consumers spend in different stages of the decision-making process. A final study supports a conceptual framework to classify these delay reasons based on the two dimensions of internal versus external locus of causation, and whether the purpose of delay is related to the decision or to unrelated activities.","['nanDIFFUSION-MODELS', 'EXTERNAL SEARCH', 'PROCRASTINATION', 'PURCHASE', 'PRICE', 'TIME', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'INFORMATION', 'JUDGMENTS', 'BEHAVIOR']",['time'],decisions diffusion causation
"Research Summary We conduct a field experiment at an entrepreneurship bootcamp to investigate whether interaction with proximate peers shapes a nascent startup team's performance. We find that teams whose members lack prior ties to others at the bootcamp experience peer effects that influence the quality of their product prototypes. A 1-SD increase in the performance of proximate teams is related to a two-thirds SD improvement for a focal team. In contrast, we find that teams whose members have many prior ties interact less frequently with proximate peers, and thus their performance is unaffected by nearby teams. Our findings highlight how prior social connections, which are often a source of knowledge and influence, can limit new interactions and thus the ability of organizations to leverage peer effects to improve the performance of their members. Managerial Summary Researchers and policymakers believe that accelerators, incubators, and bootcamps help entrepreneurial ecosystems spur innovation and drive startup growth. The effectiveness of these organizations, in large part, depends on the new social interactions fostered among colocated entrepreneurs. Yet, little evidence exists about the extent to which such interactions actually lead to spillovers. We ran a controlled experiment at a startup bootcamp to investigate when entrepreneurs were most affected by their colocated peers. Not everyone benefited. We found that entrepreneurs with many prior ties to others at the bootcamp made fewer new connections, especially to neighboring peers, and thus did not experience significant spillovers. In contrast, those without prior connections experienced the greatest spillovers because they interacted frequently with people on nearby colocated teams. Our findings highlight how organizations like incubators and bootcamps, designed to foster new connections, might sometimes just reinforce old networks.","['accelerators and incubators', 'entrepreneurship', 'entrepreneurship training', 'field experiment', 'peer effectsSOCIAL NETWORKS', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'COHESION', 'POLICY']","['entrepreneurship', 'field experiment', 'field experiment', 'organizations', 'policy']",field experiment entrepreneurship knowledge organizations
"More than a billion dollars is spent annually on generic advertisements that promote the consumption of commodity goods. Generic advertising is designed to increase primary demand, or the size of the pie, without affecting selective demand, or the  share of the pie. We find evidence to the contrary - generic advertising increases the consumer's sensitivity to changes in price and systematically alters brand preferences. These effects of generic advertising can be attributed to the tendency of generic ads to change the relative importance of the attributes used to evaluate the brands. The results have implications for the public policy issue of how to effectively implement generic advertising without differentially benefiting certain brands and the managerial issue of how to integrate generic and brand advertising in order to achieve product category and brand differentiation goals.","['nanLONG-TERM-MEMORY', 'SIMILARITY', 'PROMOTION', 'ATTRIBUTE', 'PRICE', 'MIX']","['attribute', 'price']",price
"This article examines consumers' emotional reactions for a specific negative service-a mammography screening test-and measures how such reactions are influenced by the consumer's stage in the screening process and her beliefs in the efficacy of the test. Stage in process moderates the relationship between test efficacy beliefs and stress, such that those obtaining screening tests feel more stress as their belief in the efficacy of mammography increases while those obtaining follow-up diagnostic tests feel less stress as their belief in the efficacy of mammography increases. Process measures indicate that fear of a positive mammogram result is uniquely associated with stress for those receiving a screening mammogram, while uncertainty regarding diagnosis is uniquely associated with stress for those receiving a diagnostic mammogram. Implications for better managing the testing experience and for understanding negative services more generally are discussed.","['mammography', 'stress', 'efficacy beliefs', 'health care serviceBREAST-CANCER', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS', 'MAMMOGRAPHY ADHERENCE', 'MODEL', 'WOMEN', 'SATISFACTION', 'ENCOUNTERS', 'RESPONSES', 'WORRY', 'FEAR']","['mammography', 'stress', 'efficacy beliefs', 'efficacy beliefs', 'fear']",mammography efficacy stress
"Stores with more satisfied employees also have greater customer satisfaction ( CS). Two theoretical mechanisms have been employed to explain why: affective transfer (i.e., emotional contagion) and performance motivation (i.e., extra-effort service behaviors). The authors provide a constructive replication of these relationships, while also arguing for an important boundary condition: store busyness. The authors suggest that in busy stores, employee attitudes ( a) are less likely to be emotionally expressed by employees and caught by customers, and (b) are less likely to emerge as extra-effort performance, compared to slow stores. In a survey study of 328 warehouse-style retail stores, with multisource and time-separated data and controlling for contextual features, the authors support both direct affective transfer and indirect effects via an objective performance measure (i.e., speed of response to customers' requests for help). However, these associations depended on store busyness: store employee satisfaction had less influence on CS and service responsiveness in busy stores compared to slower stores. The results suggest several practical implications. For example, interventions targeting employee morale will have a greater effect on customer reactions in less successful stores with fewer sales transactions, while busy stores will see more benefit from interventions targeting other factors.","['customer satisfaction', 'employees', 'moderation analysis', 'regression models', 'service encounter', 'service-profit chainUNIT-LEVEL', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-EFFECTIVENESS', 'SERVICE QUALITY', 'SATISFACTION', 'ATTITUDES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'BEHAVIORS', 'EMOTIONS', 'CLIMATE', 'METAANALYSIS']","['customer satisfaction', 'customer satisfaction', 'employees', 'satisfaction', 'attitudes', 'performance', 'behaviors']",customer satisfaction affective contagion

"A model of factors thought to affect the treatment of disabled individuals in organizations is presented. Specifically, the model suggests that person characteristics (e.g., attributes of the disabled person, attributes of the observer), environmental factors (i.e., legislation), and organizational characteristics (e.g., norms. values, policies. the nature of jobs, reward systems) combine to affect the way disabled individuals are treated in organizations. Furthermore, the model indicates that the relationships just noted are mediated by observers' cognitions (i.e., categorization. stereotyping, expectancies) and affective states. Finally. the model predicts that the disabled person's responses feed back to modify observers' expectancies and organizational characteristics. Implications for conducting research on disability issues and facilitating the inclusion of disabled individuals in organizational settings are discussed.","['nanSOCIAL-INTERACTION', 'PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS', 'CHANGING ATTITUDES', 'DISABILITY', 'EMPLOYMENT', 'DISCRIMINATION', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'COMPETENCE', 'CONTACT', 'PEOPLE']",['disability'],responses
"Management system standards, also called meta-standards, have been adopted by an increasing number of organizations across the world. Although these management system standards are based on the same type of management principles and institutional arrangements, the literature remains scattered, with diverse studies focused on specific standards and published in various journals. The main objective of this paper is to analyse the academic research on meta-standards through an integrative review intended to shed light on the main conclusions and substantial advances made in this area. This integrative review focuses more specifically on the two main meta-standards which have been adopted by more than 1.3 million organizations worldwide: ISO 14001 and ISO 9001.

"New ventures seem to suffer more difficulties and business failures than do established firms. Also, there is a pattern to the mortality, with most newly founded businesses lasting only a few years. Explanations of high failure rates in new ventures have often centered on ''poor management,'' or have postulated that firms chose inappropriate strategies for their markets and economic environments. The present article conceives of new venture mortality as similar in nature to patterns of development that we observe, for instance, in human embryos or in the formation of new species. That is, development is an inherently hazardous process. Some of the specific hazards of development are: 1. Generic Entry Barriers. It is generally not possible for a new firm or product to successfully enter an already crowded, stable market where competitors are strong. It is more feasible instead to enter a new or growing marker; or to enter with a ''substitute'' product that is clearly superior to those existing; or to exploit an unnoticed market opening; or to develop competitive strengths ''secretly,'' without overtly challenging others in the industry. 2. Density of Developmental Hurdles. Any new entity must clear a sequence of important hurdles on its way to maturity, such as establishing a well-ordered office, a functional sales channel, etc. Failure at any one hurdle is potentially fatal, and a mathematical analysis shows that the likelihood of passing even 10 hurdles in a row is about one in three. The earliest hurdles tend to be the most difficult and to crowd more densely than later hurdles. Particularly troublesome are ''phase changes'' where a company first starts business or becomes one thing rather than another within a short period of time. 3. Amplification of Maturational Error. Any complex system that grows rapidly and is unable to predict the future perfectly is going to accumulate structural errors that become very difficult to remedy. This is a natural and inevitable developmental process, as the system grows in complexity and the flaw itself becomes a pillar of the system. If an imitator or competitor arrives soon afterward and spots the error, he or she will easily be able to retool and redesign a better system, whereas the first firm is stuck with old habits, tools, dies, and production methods. 4. Sequence and Control in Development. Every embryonic organism has a design template outlined in its DNA that is carefully followed. Both the developing fetus itself and the mother have monitoring and control mechanisms that trigger an abortion if the development process goes awry. New ventures lack such mechanisms. They are more susceptible to ''developmental deviance,'' likely to differ from the model successful corporation of their type. 5. Smallness and the Asymmetry of Luck. Small things are more subject to the whims of fate than big things. Amount of resources is the key. Because new ventures typically start off with scarce resources, a bad bounce can sink the company, and the probability of at least one such bad bounce is high. 6. Costs of Organizing. Like all of the larger-brained mammals, a new company, such as a medical supply firm, must learn through experience much of what it means to be mature. Costs associated with learning arrive just when the Jinn is most vulnerable and distracted by other challenges. In one sense, the message of this article is good news, in that managers of failed enterprises need not assume all the blame. After all, if most new businesses do poorly, then failure is the average or typical case, and it makes little sense to say that the average manager is ''poor.'' The bad news is that, if our perspective is correct, managers of new ventures have less scope to influence the success of their enterprises than is commonly believed. The managerial recommendations that emerge are that new ventures are more likely to succeed to the extent that they: have sponsorship or capital, have managers with a range of experience in previous ventures, are given extra assistance of ''shelter,'' or can ensure a high probability of passing all of the hurdles faced by a new venture.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL MORTALITY', 'CELL-CYCLE', 'VENTURES', 'SUCCESS', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL', 'TECHNOLOGIES', 'MODEL', 'ADOLESCENCE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EVOLUTION']","['ventures', 'success', 'model']",management entry
"Norm violations disrupt social order, and according to prior research, social order can be restored through the punishment of norm violators. Based on this conceptual framework, the current research examines a prevalent yet overlooked behavior in the consumer literature by showing that consumers play an active role in making punishment decisions. Importantly, this article highlights three factors that affect the balance in social order and thus are critical in consumer-to-consumer punishment decisions. First, when a third party in the consumption environment restores social order through punishment, consumers will refrain from punishing further (study 1). Second, punishment is mitigated when the norm violator faces an unjustified adversity, as punishment would create a further imbalance in social order (studies 2a and 2b). Third, the level of punishment required to achieve social order is reduced for a higher status norm violator (study 3). Finally, this article identifies multiple avenues for future research that build on the current work.","['nanOBESITY STIGMA', 'ATTRACTIVENESS', 'CONSUMPTION', 'MODELS', 'IMPACT', 'NORMS']",['consumption'],norm violations consumption
"This article, to date, is the first to consolidate, review, and integrate over 250 earlier studies that examine the country-specific determinants of cross-border Mergers and acquisitions. Following 6Ws' systematic review design and protocol, we survey the taxonomy of research publishbd over the past three decades in international business, strategic management, finance, and economics. We present our syntheses in seven strands: macroeconomic and financial markets environment, institutional and regulatory environment, political environment and corruption, tax and the taxation environment, accounting standards and valuation guidelines, cultural environment, and geographical environment. Our integrative review and discussions are framed through Home-Host country, West-South, and SouthWest directional flows. We then show some highlights of the bibliometric analysis, provide a summary for each country-level determinant, and offer several theoretical propositions and research directions in need of future exploration. The review suggests that better the host Country's institutional laws with regard to financial markets, taxation and corporate governance, then higher the number of inward acquisitions. It emphasizes that geopolitical distance, regulatory distance, and cultural distance between developed and developing economies are more likely to be moderated by the target country's market size, natural resources base, and weak institutional laws, especially corporate tax and capital gains tax.

"Entrepreneurial 'process' perspectives explain the events of an entrepreneurial journey in terms of mechanisms, such as 'effectual logic', 'bricolage', 'dynamic creation', 'opportunity tension' and 'enactment'. Process theorists, however, have not as yet developed an analytical framework that explains an entrepreneurial event in relation to the entrepreneurial journey as the unit of analysis. Building on Sarasvathy's (2003, 2008) and Venkataraman et al.'s (2012) conception of entrepreneurship inquiry as a 'science of the artificial' (Simon, 1996), we explain how this research gap can be addressed by conceptualizing the entrepreneurial journey as an 'emergent hierarchical system of entrepreneurial artifact-creating processes'. From this perspective, entrepreneurial events can be explained in relation to the endogenous dynamics of prior patterns of artifact emergence. We discuss some research implications of focusing on artifact emergence as a key unit of analysis in process theory development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"Although extant studies have increased our understanding of the decision of when to terminate a project and its organizational implications, they do not explore the contextual mechanisms underlying the link between the speed at which a project is terminated and the learning of those directly working on the project. This is surprising because perceptions of project failure likely differ between those who own the option (i.e., the decision maker) and those who are the option (i.e., project team members). In this multiple case study, we explored research and development (R&D) subsidiaries within a large multinational parent organization and generated several new insights: (1) rather than alleviate negative emotions, delayed termination was perceived as creeping death, thwarting new career opportunities and generating negative emotions; (2) rather than obstructing learning from project experience, negative emotions motivated sensemaking efforts; and (3) rather than emphasizing learning after project termination, in the context of rapid redeployment of team members after project termination, delayed termination provided employees the time to reflect on, articulate, and codify lessons learned.

"This article challenges the assumption that the factors associated with the self-employment choices of women differ from those of men; specifically, we test the extent to which women are influenced by standard economic factors compared with family and social issues. We find that economic factors influence the self-employment choices made by men and by women in the long and short-run. Although some findings were sensitive to the chosen self-employment measure our short-run findings, in particular, are at variance with the interpretation that self-employed women are less likely to be influenced by economic factors than their male counterparts. Consequently, we argue that gender-based explanations have exaggerated the importance of social factors in the self-employment choices made by women. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"Teleworking is a work practice that entails remote working for at least some of the time. Common arrangements include work done at home or in the field, by teleworkers in a range of occupations. As such, telework is one of the most radical departures from standard working conditions in the suite of flexible work practices now gaining widespread acceptance. In this paper, we develop an explanatory model of organizational adoption of teleworking. We do this as a means of integrating the current literature on the incidence of teleworking and to provide a theoretical grounding and framework for understanding differentials in the growth of teleworking in different organizations, industries and countries. We begin by developing an appropriate framework for conceptualizing teleworking. Ve propose a multivariate approach that is able to differentiate the various forms of teleworking. We then use this framework to develop a model and a series of propositions concerning the adoption of different forms of teleworking.

"Managers are faced with complex decisions when considering automating the front end of a service, where the firm interacts with its customers (e.g., check-in at airports). We develop an analytical model for the optimal decisions as to whether to automate the service and which price to charge. The model accounts for automation-induced customer inconvenience in the short run and differences in service quality and production costs in the long run. We show that it may be optimal not to automate, even if automated service reduces production costs for the firm and is ultimately desired by customers. In other situations, automated service is optimal, even though customer inconvenience may trigger financial losses in the short run. Automated service may also become optimal, as customers become more sensitive to service quality, but only if the quality of the automation technology is sufficiently high. We show that the firm should compensate customers for automation-induced inconvenience, but this price compensation can be reduced as customers become more comfortable with the service. Although automated service is cheaper to produce than labor-produced service, the firm should charge a price premium if the quality of the automated service is sufficiently superior.","['labor-automation trade-offs', 'self-service technology', 'customer inconvenience', 'price compensation', 'analytical modelUSER ACCEPTANCE', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'SATISFACTION', 'TECHNOLOGY']","['customer inconvenience', 'customer inconvenience', 'price compensation', 'price compensation', 'technology']",quality technology
"Generalized structured component analysis has emerged in marketing and psychometric literature as an alternative to structural equation modeling. A recent simulation study recommends that, in most cases, this analysis is preferable to structural equation modeling because it outperforms the latter when the model is misspecified. This article examines the characteristics of generalized structured component analysis and reveals that the surprising previous findings are attributable to an incomplete experimental design and an error incurred during the software implementation of generalized structured component analysis. Simulated data show that generalized structured component analysis provides inconsistent estimates. In some instances, model misspecification can nearly neutralize this inconsistency, but in others it will reinforce the inconsistency. Moreover, generalized structured component analysis is hardly suitable for mediation analysis because it substantially overestimates the direct effect. Thus, generalized structured component analysis cannot be recommended universally over structural equation modeling.","['Generalized structured component analysis', 'Structural equation modeling', 'Model misspecification', 'Mediationnan']","['generalized structured component analysis', 'generalized structured component analysis', 'generalized structured component analysis', 'generalized structured component analysis', 'structural equation modeling', 'structural equation modeling', 'structural equation modeling', 'model misspecification', 'model misspecification']",generalized structured component analysis structural equation modeling simulation mediation
"The success of an innovating firm often depends on the efforts of other innovators in its environment. How do the challenges faced by external innovators affect the focal firm's outcomes? To address this question we first characterize the external environment according to the structure Of interdependence. We follow the flow of inputs and outputs in the ecosystem to distinguish between upstream components that tire handled by the focal firm, and downstream complements that are bundled by the firm's customers. We hypothesize that the effects of external innovation challenges depend not only on their magnitude, but also 017 their location in the ecosystem relative to the focal firm. We identify a key asymmetry that results from the location of challenges relative to a focal firm-greater upstream innovation challenges in components enhance the benefits that accrue to technology leaders, while greater downstream innovation challenges in complements erode these benefits. We,further propose that the effectiveness of vertical integration as a strategy to manage ecosystem interdependence increases over the course of the technology life cycle.

"The present research proposes a new perspective to investigate the effect of product anthropomorphism on consumers' comparative judgment strategy in comparing two anthropomorphized (vs. two nonanthropomorphized) product options in a consideration set. Six experiments show that anthropomorphism increases consumers' use of an absolute judgment strategy (vs. a dimension-by-dimension strategy) in comparative judgment, leading to increased preference for the option with a more favorable overall evaluation over the option with a greater number of superior dimensions. The effect is mediated by consumers' perception of each anthropomorphized product alternative as an integrated entity rather than a bundle of separate attributes. The authors find the effect to be robust by directly tracing the process of participants' information processing using MouseLab software and eye-tracking techniques, and by self-reported preferences and real consumption choices. Moreover, the effect is moderated by the motivation to seek maximized accuracy or ease. These studies have important implications for theories about anthropomorphism and comparative judgment as well as marketing practice.","['anthropomorphism', 'comparative judgment', 'absolute strategy', 'dimension-by-dimension strategyDECISION-MAKING', 'INFORMATION', 'SELECTION', 'ATTRACTION', 'STRATEGIES', 'MOTIVATION', 'THINKING', 'HUMANS', 'MODEL']","['anthropomorphism', 'comparative judgment', 'comparative judgment', 'information', 'motivation']",product anthropomorphism comparative judgment dimension dimensions
"This study examines how a social psychological bias referred to as pluralistic ignorance may occur in corporate boards and how this bias could contribute to strategic persistence in response to relatively low firm performance. Our theory suggests that under conditions of low performance, there may be a systematic tendency for outside directors to underestimate the extent to which fellow directors share their concerns about the viability of the firm's corporate strategy. This reduces the propensity for individual directors to express their concerns about the current corporate strategy in board meetings, decreasing the likelihood that boards will initiate strategic change in response to low firm performance. We also posit factors that may moderate the extent to which pluralistic ignorance occurs on boards. We suggest that demographic homogeneity among outside directors (with respect to gender, functional background, education, and industry of employment) and the density of friendship ties among them will significantly moderate the occurrence of pluralistic ignorance on boards. We test our hypotheses with original survey data from a large sample of outside directors at medium-sized U.S. companies and find support for our theory. We discuss contributions of our theory and findings to,the literatures on corporate governance, strategic persistence and change, and group decision-making processes in organizations.","['nanMANAGEMENT TEAM DEMOGRAPHY', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'RELATIONAL DEMOGRAPHY', 'SOCIAL INTEGRATION', 'DECLINE PROCESSES', 'CEO COMPENSATION', 'TOP MANAGERS', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'GOVERNANCE', 'POWER']","['decision making', 'decision making', 'governance']",performance directors
"Long-term reversals (LTRs) have been extensively documented as existing in international markets. The predictability of returns opens the question whether investors should continue to diversify across international markets. Such predictability also has implications for the corporate decision of where and when to raise capital. This paper re-examines the international evidence for long-term contrarian profits using a longer time horizon than all previous studies (81 years of data from 1925 to 2005), and finds that the long-term contrarian anomaly disappears when time-varying (conditional) alphas are considered. This is true even without transaction costs. For the marginal trader, conservative transaction costs subsume LTR profits, whether returns are risk-adjusted or not. This suggests that benefits from actual trades on LTRs do not negate a strategy based on diversification. Although time-varying beta has been extensively documented as ineffective in describing LTRs, this paper demonstrates that it is important to control for time variation in alpha. A full conditional capital asset-pricing model captures the LTR premium. This suggests that macroeconomic factors are important for understanding LTRs and their associated risk.

"This manuscript investigates the role of individual team members' breadth of functional experience for their interteam coordination behavior. Integrating personal construct and social identity theories, we examine interpersonal cognitive complexity as a mediating variable and organizational identification as a moderator. We test our hypotheses across two independent field studies, comprising an international peace support training mission (Study 1) and a municipality administration (Study 2). Corroborating our predictions, interpersonal cognitive complexity appeared as a conditional mediating variable that can translate an individual's breadth of functional experience into interteam coordination. The strength and direction of this indirect relationship, however, depended on the individual's identification with the organization as a whole. Moreover, on the team level of analysis, we found members' overall interteam coordination to positively relate with team performance in Study 2. All in all, this paper advances new knowledge on the antecedents, mechanisms, contingency factors, and team-level consequences of members' boundary spanning.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'R-AND-D', 'COGNITIVE-COMPLEXITY', 'BOUNDARY SPANNERS', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'COMMUNICATION SKILL', 'MANAGEMENT TEAMS', 'METHOD VARIANCE', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'DIVERSITY']","['cognitive complexity', 'cognitive complexity', 'identification']",identity cognitive complexity identification
"Competitor identification, a core element of competitive dynamics, has been of long-standing interest to researchers in management and related disciplines. This broad interest has resulted in various definitions and conceptualizations of competitor identification as well as various approaches to studying it, which impairs the integration of existing knowledge aimed at answering vital questions regarding its nature, processes, and implications. To help researchers confront the complexities underlying this phenomenon, we identify, review, and organize theory and research on competitor identification across the management, marketing, and industrial organization economics disciplines. Based on our review, we organize the identified literature into four perspectives on competitor identification labeled as industry-oriented, strategic groups-oriented, manager-oriented, and customer-oriented. For each of these perspectives, we also identify major research streams and these streams' foci and contributions. Building on our review, we propose an agenda for future management research that addresses both unresolved debates in the reviewed literature and identifies new promising connections between competitor identification and specific areas of management theory and research. We organize this future research agenda into six main themes focusing on exploring the dynamics of competitor identification, building connections to research on interorganizational relations, building a practice and process perspective, expanding micro-oriented approaches, and exploring international and entrepreneurial dimensions of competitor identification.","['competitor identification', 'competitor analysis', 'competitive dynamics', 'multidisciplinary reviewSTRATEGIC GROUPS', 'MARKET STRUCTURES', 'PAST ACCOMPLISHMENTS', 'SPATIAL COMPETITION', 'GENERIC STRATEGIES', 'FIRM', 'INDUSTRY', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'ORGANIZATION', 'MANAGEMENT']","['competitor identification', 'competitor identification', 'competitive dynamics', 'competitive dynamics', 'industry', 'organization', 'management']",competitor
"The large majority of online grocery shoppers are multichannel shoppers who keep visiting offline grocery stores to combine convenience advantages of online shopping with self-service advantages of offline stores. An important retail management question, therefore, is how these consumers divide grocery purchases across the retailer's online and offline channel. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of category characteristics on the allocation pattern of multichannel grocery shoppers and find that category allocation decisions are affected not only by marketing mix differences between the online and offline channel, but also by intrinsic category characteristics like perceived purchase risk and shopping convenience. In addition, we examine the effect of online buying experience. In line with expectations, we find that it can affect allocation patterns in different ways: (i) it attenuates the perceived risk of buying sensory categories online, thereby reducing differences in online category share, (ii) it reinforces marketing mix (assortment) effects, thereby making online category share differences more pronounced, and (iii) it has no effect for factors such as promotions that are easy to evaluate without experience, thereby leaving the online category share stable. In addition to different experience effects across allocation factors, we also observe variations in experience effects across consumer segments.

"The spread of Lean management has fuelled debates over the changing nature of workplace domination. While Lean discourses often espouse a 'human relations' approach, research has suggested the proliferation of coercion systems and questioned whether Lean is instead shorthand for cost-cutting and new forms of domination. The varied interpretations of Lean have explained the heterogeneity of worker responses, including forms of resistance. Our ethnography explores this heterogeneity by examining the implementation of Lean in a printing factory and tracing the emergence of shopfloor opposition. Various tactics were devised by workers, ranging from tangible procedures such as sabotage and working-to-rule to more subtle forms reflecting irony and contempt. We argue that the distinctive manifestations of domination emerging during the Lean programme stimulated particular forms of worker reaction, which are explained through fieldwork illustrations. Overall, we produce a theoretical explanation of domination and resistance that builds upon and extends the extant scholarship.","['ethnography', 'domination', 'resistance', 'lean production', 'organizational changePRINTING INDUSTRY', 'LEAN PRODUCTION', 'HUMOR', 'POWER', 'WORK', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'TEAMWORKING', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'SOCIOLOGY', 'TOYOTA']","['ethnography', 'domination', 'resistance', 'work']",management workplace domination
"There has been a significant increase in scholarly research focusing on marketing capabilities as an important aspect of marketing theory-based explanations of firm performance. This growing research interest in marketing capabilities has also been reflected in the international marketing literature. However, it is unclear whether and how thinking and research about international marketing capabilities differs from that of marketing capabilities in a domestic market context. To explore this question, the authors conduct a review of studies of marketing capabilities in the most influential journals publishing research in international marketing. They supplement this with insights from interviews with executives in firms engaged to varying degrees in international marketing. The study suggests that there remain numerous important unanswered questions in conceptualizing and empirically researching international marketing capabilities.","['marketing capabilities', 'international marketing', 'marketing strategy', 'marketing performanceCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT', 'EXPORT VENTURE PERFORMANCE', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'RESOURCE-BASED APPROACH', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'EMERGING MARKET', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITY']","['marketing capabilities', 'marketing capabilities', 'international marketing', 'international marketing', 'firm performance', 'firm performance']",marketing capabilities firm performance
"This paper uses data on 23 process development projects in pharmaceuticals to explore the broader issue of how organizations create, implement, and replicate new routines. A framework is presented which links approaches to experimentation and the structure of underlying knowledge. Although the concept of learning-by-doing is well accepted in the literature, the framework here suggests that where underlying scientific knowledge is sufficiently strong, effective learning may take place outside the final use environment in laboratories (i.e., 'learning-before-doing'). This proposition is tested by comparing how an emphasis on laboratory experimentation impacts process development lead times in two different technological environments: traditional chemical-based pharmaceuticals and new biotechnology-based pharmaceuticals. The data indicate that in chemical-based pharmaceuticals-an environment characterized by deep theoretical and practical knowledge of the process technology-more emphasis on laboratory experimentation (learning-before-doing) is associated with more rapid development. In contrast in biotechnology-based pharmaceuticals-an environment in which process technology is often characterized as being more of an 'art' than a science-a greater emphasis on laboratory experimentation does not seem to shorten process development lead times. These results suggest that there is no one best way to learn, but that different approaches may be required in different knowledge environments.","['ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING', 'PROCESS R AND D', 'PHARMACEUTICALS', 'EXPERIMENTATIONFIRM']",['pharmaceuticals'],projects organizations
"Shortly after Groupon started its business in 2008, selling one deal a day with substantial price discounts, daily-deal sites became new online shopping places for many people. Starting with Groupon, most daily-deal sites required that voucher sales be higher than a predetermined number before deals become active. This feature, known as the tipping point, was a unique characteristic of the daily-deal business and is identified as one of the most prominent features of social shopping. Most daily-deal sites also required that a redemption period start after a deal was over and be fixed, usually 90 days, presumably to maximize the promotional effect of deals by encouraging rapid voucher redemption. The question remains, however, whether such features actually contributed to the success of the daily-deal industry. Using individual-level panel data from a major daily deal site in Korea, we analyze whether consumers' purchase and redemption behaviors were affected by these features and how consumers changed their behaviors as they continued to purchase and redeem vouchers over time. We find that the presence of the tipping point did not boost voucher sales and likely deterred new customers from buying deals right away. We also find that new customers tended to redeem their vouchers quickly, and this likely caused the small businesses that offered deals to become overwhelmed. It is not surprising, given our findings, that both Groupon and the Korean daily deal site abandoned the use of the tipping point and modified redemption rules.

"The relationship between political violence and greenfield foreign direct investment is contingent on the type of violence, the characteristics of the investment-receiving sector, and the international scope of the investing firm. Analysis using a dynamic fixed effects model for a panel of 90 developing countries shows that nationwide political conflict is negatively associated with total and nonresource-related greenfield FDI, but not with resource-related greenfield FDI. The insensitivity of resource FDI to political conflict is explained by the high profitability of natural-resource extraction and geographic constraints on location choice. In the nonresource sector, the least geographically diversified firms are most sensitive to conflict. Other types of political violence, including intermittent violence in the form of terrorist acts and assassinations, or persistent but low-impact events, such as political terror, have no effect on the location choice decisions of multinational enterprises. These findings inform the strategies of multinationals with a nuanced and much-needed understanding of the effects of political violence and the risks it poses to their businesses.","['political violence', 'foreign direct investment (FDI)', 'political risk', 'heterogeneity', 'political conflict', 'economic geographyFOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'INSTITUTION-BASED VIEW', 'INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS', 'NATURAL-RESOURCES', 'LOCATION DECISION', 'TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM', 'HUMAN-RIGHTS', 'RISK', 'CONFLICT', 'CHOICE']","['political violence', 'political violence', 'political conflict', 'political conflict', 'risk', 'conflict', 'choice']",political violence political fdi fdi location enterprises
"The use of organizational web sites for recruitment has become increasingly common. Despite their widespread growth, however: little is known about how these web sites influence recruitment outcomes. In the current paper; we present a model that explicates how job seekers interact with and respond to web site characteristics to predict various job seeker attitudes and behaviors. We suggest that job seekers are initially affected by the facade of a web site, comprised of the web site's aesthetic and playfulness features. Coupled with system features of the web site, these initial affective reactions then influence perceptions of the usability of the web site. Perceptions of usability and affective reactions work through two key mediating constructs, job seeker search behavior and web site attitude, to ultimatey predict applicant attraction. Throughout the paper we present a series of testable propositions that should serve to guide future research. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

"Beginning with Chandler's 1962 seminal work, researchers have emphasized that competitive strategy is not a static phenomenon, but rather a sequence of interconnected actions and reactions unfolding over time. This paper reviews the empirical research on dynamic competitive strategy published between 1986 and 2005 in nine leading strategic management journals. An integrated framework is used to showcase the research in terms of antecedents, strategic actions and outcomes. The literature review demonstrates that significant progress has been made in the field of dynamic competitive strategy, and yet that there are still many promising lines of inquiry for future theoretical and empirical research, particularly in the areas of strategic action timing and path dependency.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'US PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'MULTIMARKET ENVIRONMENT', 'TECHNOLOGY ALLIANCES', 'EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION', 'MANAGEMENT JOURNALS', 'INSURANCE INDUSTRY', 'MOBILITY BARRIERS', 'ESTABLISHED FIRMS']","['management journals', 'management journals']",competitive action timing

"Prior research has traced poor judgment quality to poor calibration. We suggest inconsistency to be another reason for poor judgment quality-utilizing different models on different occasions resulting in increased wandering in judgments. We demonstrate differing consistency in the utilization of models depending upon which variable is used as a cue and which is used as the criterion to be predicted. This results in differing correlations underlying judgments between the same two variables, an internally inconsistent pattern. We trace this to the utilization of lay causal models to make predictions but with the strength of the causal story moderating the consistency in use of the model.","['nanILLUSORY CORRELATION', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'COVARIATION', 'MODELS', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'EXPLANATION', 'BRAND']",['models'],judgment
"This paper investigates the processes underlying consumers' memory-based store price judgments. The numerosity heuristic implies that the greater the number of relatively lower priced products at a store that consumers can recall, the lower will be their overall price image of the store. That is, people use the number of recalled low-price products to judge the overall store price image. We show that this expectation holds only for knowledgeable consumers. Instead, less knowledgeable consumers use the ease with which low-price products are recalled (i.e., the availability heuristic) as a cue to make store price judgments. Therefore, the fewer low-price products they recall, the easier their recall task, and the lower their price perceptions of the store. Field studies using different manipulations tested and confirmed these predictions. Managerial implications for retailers are offered. Theoretical implications for behavioral price perceptions, memory-based judgments, and the use of heuristic cues are also discussed.

"Purpose - The purpose of the research described in this paper is to disentangle the rhetoric from the reality in relation to supply chain management (SCM) adoption in practice. There is significant evidence of a divergence between theory and practice in the field of SCM. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a review of extant theory, the authors posit a new definitional construct for SCM - the Four Fundamentals - and investigated four research questions (RQs) that emerged from the theoretical review. The empirical work comprised three main phases: focussed interviews, focus groups and a questionnaire survey. Each phase used the authors' definitional construct as its basis. While the context of the paper's empirical work is Ireland, the insights and results are generalisable to other geographical contexts. Findings - The data collected during the various stages of the empirical research supported the essence of the definitional construct and allowed it to be further developed and refined. In addition, the findings suggest that, while levels of SCM understanding are generally quite high, there is room for improvement in relation to how this understanding is translated into practice. Research limitations/implications - Expansion of the research design to incorporate case studies, grounded theory and action research has the potential to generate new SCM theory that builds on the Four Fundamentals construct, thus facilitating a deeper and richer understanding of SCM phenomena. The use of longitudinal studies would enable a barometer of progress to be developed over time. Practical implications - The authors' definitional construct supports improvement in the cohesion of SCM practices, thereby promoting the effective implementation of supply chain strategies. A number of critical success factors and/or barriers to implementation of SCM theory in practice are identified, as are a number of practical measures that could be implemented at policy/supply chain/firm level to improve the level of effective SCM adoption. Originality/value - The authors' robust definitional construct supports a more cohesive approach to the development of a unified theory of SCM. In addition to a profile of SCM understanding and adoption by firms in Ireland, the related critical success factors and/or inhibitors to success, as well as possible interventions, are identified.","['Supply chain management', 'Practice', 'Implementation', 'TheoryPERFORMANCE', 'INTEGRATION', 'LOGISTICS']","['supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'practice', 'implementation']",supply chain management
"The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to be the next phase of the Internet revolution and to transform consumers' service experience. It nevertheless raises challenges on innovation in services. Based on Ram and Sheth's () theoretical framework, this work attempts to provide a better understanding of the barriers that lead to consumers' resistance to smart services as an innovation. To this end, our research adopts an integrative framework that combines functional barriers, psychological barriers, and individual barriers to explain consumer resistance to smart services. Structural equation modeling was used to test this theoretical framework. Our research enriches the existing literature by (1) adapting Ram and Sheth's () theoretical framework to the evolution of digital technologies (technological vulnerability barriers), (2) taking into account the ideological aspect of resistance (ideological barriers), and (3) considering dispositional variables (individual barriers). Moreover, it highlights the key role of skepticism toward IoT devices as a mediator between technological vulnerability barriers and individual barriers on the one hand and consumer resistance to smart services on the other.","['nanSELF-IMAGE CONGRUENCE', 'STATUS-QUO BIAS', 'INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY', 'GENDER-DIFFERENCES', 'USER ACCEPTANCE', 'PERCEIVED RISK', 'ADOPTION', 'ONLINE', 'SMART', 'MODEL']","['smart', 'model']",internet of things iot barriers

Using three independent field samples, the authors generated new, context-specific measurements for relational and collective identification using an inductive, multistage approach; established their construct validity; and provided evidence for their differential antecedents and consequences in organizational workgroups. Results indicate that relational and collective identification are distinct constructs and that they are embedded in separate nomological networks.","['identification', 'relational identification', 'groups', 'teams', 'nomological networksORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY', 'JOB-SATISFACTION', 'INDIVIDUALISM-COLLECTIVISM', 'SELF-CATEGORIZATION', 'WORK GROUPS', 'INTERPERSONAL-ATTRACTION', 'GENDER-DIFFERENCES', 'SEX-DIFFERENCES', 'COMMITMENT']","['identification', 'relational identification', 'relational identification', 'groups']",
"As an organizational form, cooperatives are increasingly being used throughout the world across different industries and sectors. While it has been suggested that various benefits can be derived from shared ownership, cooperatives are often characterized by conflict among members that, in turn, can lead to eventual failure of the cooperatives. Existing theory has suggested that the choice of formal control structure can play an important role in mitigating conflict, but a longstanding debate exists as to whether flat versus hierarchical control structures are more effective. To add further insight into this theoretical discussion, we conducted a field experiment involving 40 newly formed cooperatives in rural Ghana, which were randomly assigned to either a flat or hierarchical control structure. The quantitative results of our field experiment and subsequent qualitative data suggest that formal hierarchical control structures lead to lower levels of collective psychological ownership, which in turn result in higher levels of conflict compared to flat control structures within cooperatives. However, our results also suggest that the extent to which the choice of formal control structures influences conflict among cooperative members can be highly dependent on the absence or presence of an informal hierarchy.","['nanPSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP', 'EMPLOYEE ATTITUDES', 'POWER', 'WORK', 'DIFFERENTIATION', 'ENTREPRENEURS', 'ORGANIZATION', 'CORPORATIONS', 'NETWORKS', 'ECONOMY']",['organization'],cooperatives psychological
"In private family firms, affiliate directors are largely resource-providing servants of the family. In nonfamily public firms with dispersed ownership, affiliates are, figuratively speaking, symbiotic parasites loyally supporting their professional management hosts while extracting revenues for their home firms. The public family firm stands somewhere between and the affiliate directors in such firms are consequently an enigma. Jones, Makri, and Gomez-Mejia compare affiliate directors in public family firms with those in public nonfamily firms and find that they positively influence diversification strategy only in public family firms. They interpret this outcome as evidence that affiliate directors in public family firms act like the servants found in private family firms. I offer an alternative interpretation by suggesting that affiliate directors in public family firms are more successful versions of their parasitic cousins in public nonfamily firms. I draw attention to the Janus-headed nature of these directors to underscore why it is useful to study public family firms as a distinct ownership structure.","['nanFIRM PERFORMANCE', 'FAMILY', 'COSTS', 'CEOS']",['family'],affiliate directors diversification structure
"The fundamental dynamics of virtual and traditional face-to-face teams may be very different. The purpose of this study is to empirically examine and assess the moderating effects of virtuality on the antecedents and outcome of trust, where virtuality is measured along a continuum from face to face (no virtuality) to fully virtual rather than the more common approach of dichotomizing teams into two groups (i.e., face to face and virtual). The sample includes 116 different new product development teams from a variety of industries. The antecedents of trust that are studied are familiarity, goal clarity, training, relationship conflict, and process conflict. The outcome of trust is analyzed by determining how the impact of trust on cooperation changes as the level of virtuality changes. Primary findings are as follows: (1) Relationship conflict can be more detrimental to virtual teams than face-to-face teams because it is very difficult for team members of virtual teams to resolve their interpersonal disputes; (2) goal clarity is more important for face-to-face teams and less important for virtual teams in creating trust among team members; and (3) the impact of trust on cooperation is less for virtual teams than face-to-face teams. The primary implication for researchers and practice of these findings is that the role and importance of trust in virtual teams needs to be reevaluated. Managers using virtual teams need to realize that interpersonal relationships in virtual teams do not evolve in the same manner as face-to-face teams and may require different management techniques to be successful.","['nanFACE-TO-FACE', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'DISTRIBUTED TEAMS', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'CONFLICT', 'MODEL', 'DISTRUST', 'COMMUNICATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONTEXT']",['conflict'],conflict
"How does employer status benefit firms in the market for general human capital? On the one hand, high status employers are better able to attract workers, who value the signal of ability that employment at those firms provides. On the other hand, that same signal can help workers bid up wages and capture the value of employers' status. Exploring this tension, we argue that high status firms are able to hire higher ability workers than other firms, and do not need to pay them the full value of their ability early in the career, but must raise wages more rapidly than other firms as those workers accrue experience. We test our arguments using unique survey data on careers in investment banking.

"This paper examines how professionals working in bureaucratic organizations, despite having formal authority, struggle to enact authority over the clients they advise, transforming their right to command into deference to commands. Drawing on a comparative ethnographic study of two professional groups overseeing compliance in university laboratories, I identify how choices about their task jurisdiction influence each profession's ability to enact authority over and gain voluntary compliance from the same group of clients. One group constructs its work domain to include not only high-skilled tasks that emphasize members' expertise but also scut workmenial work with contaminated materialsthrough which they gain regular entry into clients' workspaces, developing knowledge about and relationships with clients. Using these resources to accommodate, discipline, and understand clients, they produce relational authoritythe capacity to elicit voluntary compliance with commands. The other group outsources everyday scut work and interacts with lab researchers mostly during annual inspections and training, which leads to complaints by researchers to management and eventual loss of jurisdiction. The findings show the importance of producing relational authority in contemporary professional-client interactions in bureaucratic settings and challenge the relevance of expertise and professional identity in generating relational authority. I show how holding on to, not hiving off, scut work allows professionals to enact authority over clients.","['professions', 'authority', 'autonomy', 'control', 'clients', 'scut work', 'dirty work', 'expertise', 'laboratories', 'relational authority', 'compliance', 'biosafety officers', 'health physicistsUNITED-STATES', 'IDENTITY', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'COMMUNITIES', 'TECHNICIANS', 'SOCIOLOGY', 'RESIDENTS', 'REALITY', 'SCIENCE', 'MODEL']","['authority', 'clients', 'scut work', 'scut work', 'expertise', 'laboratories', 'relational authority', 'relational authority', 'compliance', 'identity', 'organizations']",organizations deference workspaces
"The difficulty of translating the in-store experience to the online environment is one of the main reasons why the fashion industry has been slower than other sectors to adopt e-commerce. Recently, however, new information technologies (ITs) have enabled consumers to evaluate fashion online, creating an interactive and exciting shopping experience. As a result, clothing has become the fastest-growing online category of goods bought in the United Kingdom. This trend could have serious consequences for brick-and-mortar stores. The aim of this quantitative research is to gain a better understanding of multichannel fashion-shopping experiences, focusing on the role of IT and the crossover effects between channels. In particular, I explore the influence of the level of online experience on the perceptions and motivations of fashion consumers when they buy across multiple channels. The theoretical framework of hedonic and utilitarian shopping values is applied to measure consumers' shopping experiences and shopping motivations to buy in different channels. The results from a quantitative survey of 439 consumers in the United Kingdom suggest the need to redefine the in-store shopping experience, promoting the use of technology as a way to create an engaging and integrated experience among channels. Retailers must think in all channels holistically, boosting interactive and new technologies for the Internet and taking advantage of all touchpoints with the consumer, including mobile devices and social networks.","['Brick-and-mortar stores', 'e-commerce', 'e-tail', 'hedonic value', 'information technologies', 'multichannel retail', 'shopping experience', 'shopping motivations', 'utilitarian valueINTERNET', 'ONLINE', 'UTILITARIAN', 'MOTIVATIONS', 'NEED', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'SHOPPERS', 'GENDER', 'STORES', 'MODEL']","['brick and mortar stores', 'brick and mortar stores', 'brick and mortar stores', 'brick and mortar stores', 'e commerce', 'e commerce', 'information technologies', 'information technologies', 'shopping experience', 'shopping experience', 'shopping motivations', 'shopping motivations', 'online', 'utilitarian', 'motivations', 'need', 'perceptions', 'stores']",fashion
"Research on the optimization of donation solicitations has focused on language and content rather than appearance. The present work considers how a solicitation's appearance influences donor response. The results indicate that potential donors make inferences about the soliciting organization based on the aesthetics of the solicitation materials. In general, highly aesthetic elements increase perceptions of organizational professionalism, which consequently leads to greater donations. However, aesthetic enhancement can backfire; when high levels of aesthetics with cost implications (e.g., embossed cardstock, gold ink) are combined with high levels of aesthetics without cost implications (e.g., attractive background, appealing font), perceptions of organizational wastefulness discourage donations. Thus, the most effective solicitation is not the most beautiful but rather one offering high levels of aesthetics without cost implications and low levels of aesthetics with cost implications. The studies demonstrate these effects in the field and in the lab and also identify moderators of the negative effect of aesthetics with cost implications on donations.","['design', 'aesthetics', 'donation solicitations', 'nonprofit', 'frugalityPRODUCT QUALITY', 'STUDENTS CHARACTERISTICS', 'PACKAGE DESIGN', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'AESTHETICS', 'JUDGMENTS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'CHARITY', 'IMPRESSIONS', 'INFORMATION']","['aesthetics', 'donation solicitations', 'donation solicitations', 'perceptions', 'aesthetics']",solicitations perceptions
"This study explores the relationships between insider ownership and earnings management in family firms and the impact of family versus nonfamily CEOs on earnings management. The results show that the larger the level of insider ownership, the greater the extent of earnings management, supporting an entrenchment effect of family ownership. Furthermore, consistent with traditional agency analyses, nonfamily CEOs exhibit a greater tendency to manage earnings than do family CEOs.The study suggests that family firms should promote information transparency and quality of accounting reporting to avoid a negative image that suggests that family firms expropriate the interests of outside shareholders.","['family firms', 'earnings management', 'family CEOs', 'controlling families', 'insider ownershipFIRM PERFORMANCE', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'INVESTOR PROTECTION', 'BONUS SCHEMES', 'INFORMATIVENESS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'ACCRUALS', 'CHOICE', 'AGENCY']","['family firms', 'family firms', 'earnings management', 'earnings management', 'family ceos', 'family ceos', 'agency']",earnings management family firms nonfamily ceos ceos
We articulate opportunities and challenges for governments and innovating firms operating within countries that display four types of national political institutional structures. We argue that corporatist and associational institutional structures influence governments' capabilities to support diffusion- and mission-oriented technology policies and firms' tendencies to engage in bricolage or breakthrough approaches to technological entrepreneurship. We then show how the relative strength of state institutions can amplify or compromise governments' policies and firms' innovation strategies.,"['nanPANEL DISPLAY INDUSTRY', 'CELTIC TIGER', 'STATE', 'FIRMS', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'STRATEGIES', 'INNOVATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'INSTITUTIONS']","['state', 'firms', 'technology', 'strategies', 'innovation', 'institutions']",technology bricolage

"A paper in one of the quality journals of Management Studies is much more important as a unit of measurement than as a contribution to knowledge. It measures academic performance and determines much academic funding. There is consequently some pressure to publish in quality journals. But quality journals are defined in terms that are themselves defined in terms of quality journals - a circularity that explains both the paper's title and the frustration of those who do not mix in these circles. We examine the gamesmanship of publishing in quality journals. Findings from a survey of heads of Management Studies departments in UK universities suggest that such gamesmanship is common. Cunning and calculation now support scholarship in Management Studies. Gamesmanship will remain common until the rewards for publishing attach to the content of papers, to what is published rather than where it is published. We propose a 'Tinkerbell Solution': without belief in the value of a paper in a quality journal, the game is no longer worth playing.","['nanRESEARCH ASSESSMENT EXERCISE', 'INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY', 'R-AND-R', 'CITATION ANALYSIS', 'BUSINESS SCHOOLS', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'RESEARCH SELECTIVITY', 'UK UNIVERSITIES', 'PROPER ROLES', 'REFLECTIONS']","['uk universities', 'uk universities']",knowledge performance
"In this study we introduce a justice perspective to examining the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards over the allocation of firm residuals that ultimately determines CEO compensation. Framing CEO pay as the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards focuses attention on the power of CEOs to increase their share of firm residuals in the form of increased compensation, and the diligence of boards of directors to constrain CEO opportunism. Framing this negotiation through a theory of justice offers an alternative perspective to the search for pay-performance sensitivity. We predict and find that as board diligence in controlling opportunism declines and CEO power increases, CEOs are increasingly able to capture a larger portion of firm residuals relative to shareholders. This finding supports critics who charge that CEO pay violates norms of distributive and procedural justice.","['CEO compensation', 'agency theory', 'board monitoring', 'distributive justiceEXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE', 'AGENCY PROBLEMS', 'STOCK-OPTIONS', 'PANEL-DATA', 'FIRM', 'BOARD']","['ceo compensation', 'ceo compensation', 'firm', 'board']",directors
"Purpose - Increasingly, private sector companies are aiming to buy and supply products and services in a sustainable way, termed sustainable supply chain management (sustainable SCM), using purchasing and supply to reduce negative impacts on the environment, economy and society. There is often a gap between rhetoric and reality, with companies often accused of paying green lip service to sustainable SCM. This research aims to explore sustainable SCM issues in companies that have been recognized as leaders in their sectors, and investigate what factors influence sustainable SCM, and how practice might change in the future. Design/methodology/approach - Current practice in sustainable SCM and predictions for the future were explored in case studies of seven UK companies, through semi-structured interviews with purchasers and CSR practitioners, and secondary data collection from reports and websites. Sectors included aerospace, retail, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink. Findings - Companies were mapped onto a typology of approaches to sustainable SCM, based on internal and external enablers and barriers. Companies were classified as Internal focusers, Reserved players, External responders, and Agenda setters. Predictions for the future of sustainable SCM within the companies were also explored. Research limitations/implications - The typology could be further explored through a survey of firms from different sectors, and with firms not seen as leading in their field. Originality/value - The paper draws on contingency theory and existing sustainable SCM literature to develop a typology of approaches to sustainable SCM. The paper draws useful lessons from leading companies for practitioners seeking to implement sustainable SCM.","['Case studies', 'Corporate responsibility', 'Sustainable supply chains', 'Sustainable development', 'Supply chain management', 'United Kingdom', 'Multiple retailersCONTINGENCY THEORY', 'GREEN', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INTEGRATION', 'STRATEGIES', 'PRODUCT', 'CHINA']","['case studies', 'case studies', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'green', 'product']",supply chain management impacts contingency theory
"This essay identifies five research opportunities that concern consumer response to product design. The first opportunity involves the need for more research on the interaction between form and function in consumer product evaluations. To this end, more knowledge about how product appearance characteristics influence consumer evaluation of both product form and function, and how this differs between countries and in time, is needed. The second research opportunity concerns the influence of consumer input in the front end of new product development on product success. Although the positive effect of market information use on product success is known, more actionable insight into which consumer information or input is beneficial in which circumstances is largely missing. The third opportunity for research concerns how to include subjective product attributes in concept testing. Getting valid feedback from consumers, which includes functional as well as emotional and experiential aspects, can improve proficiency in the early stages of product development. In this essay, several ways of approaching this research endeavor are highlighted. Next to enhancing market receipt and the assessment of product design, two topics that concern consumer response to product design from a more managerial viewpoint are identified. The first of these is strategic management of product styling. The importance and opportunities of visual design for brand management has gained more attention in the literature; different strategies and the cases in which they are beneficial are issues for further research. And finally, the design of product service systems (PSSs) provides opportunities for future research. Here, engendering perceptual unity between products and services and an explicit managing of meanings and feelings that PSSs should communicate are issues at play.","['nanCUSTOMER', 'INNOVATION', 'SERVICE', 'BRAND']","['service', 'brand']",
"Justifying information technology (IT) projects is desirable but challenging. Given the unprecedented level of functional integration in e-business environments, the way to link IT projects to business benefits is by capturing interactions in the business process in which they are embedded. Because the application of IT will alter the physical and information flows of a business process, the benefits of an IT project can be estimated by rigorously representing these flows. A system dynamics approach for this purpose is proposed, and, using a call center application as an example, the way this approach links an IT project to its business benefits is demonstrated. Simulations show how the model can be used to make trade-offs among important project parameters. In addition to linking IT projects to business performance, this approach offers insights into the timing of anticipated benefits.","['information technology', 'information-technology projects', 'justification', 'process modeling', 'system dynamicsSYSTEMS', 'INVESTMENT', 'DYNAMICS', 'QUALITY', 'FIRM']","['information technology', 'information technology', 'dynamics']",it projects system dynamics
"Discount negotiations are prevalent in retailing and serve as key instruments for adjusting retail prices to the individual customer. Accurate perception of the importance the customer attaches to price, which the authors label as customer price importance (CPI) sensing, should be critical to retail salespeople's negotiation performance. However, prior research has neither conceptually nor empirically investigated the role of CPI sensing in customer salesperson interactions. Addressing this research void, this study analyzes both antecedents and consequences of salespeople's accurate CPI sensing in discount negotiations with customers. The authors use a four-sources multilevel data set from the B2C automobile retailing context that comprises data on 537 salesperson customer interactions. Results provide evidence that through accurate CPI sensing, salespeople are able to substantially reduce the discounts they grant to customers (on average by $616 per transaction). Moreover, with respect to CPI sensing accuracy, results show that retail salespeople misperceive CPI owing to reliance on heuristic customer cues. (c) 2015 New York University.

"In the context of the changing workforce, this study introduced two perspectives on HRM and distinguished universalistic developmental HRM from contingent accommodative HRM. We predicted two separate pathways for the effects on two employee outcomes: work engagement and affective commitment. We expected that developmental HRM would universally relate to employee outcomes by rebalancing the psychological contract between the employee and organization into a less transactional to a more relational contract. We also predicted that accommodative HRM would relate to outcomes only when fulfilling specific needs of employees, associated with their selecting, optimizing, and compensating strategies. Results of a multilevel study among 1058 employees in 17 healthcare units fully supported our expectations regarding the role of the psychological contract. Additionally, we found support for the expected roles of selection and compensation, but not for optimization strategy. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that HRM relates to employee outcomes through multiple pathways, which can be either universal or contingent.","['accommodative HRM', 'affective commitment', 'developmental HRM', 'employee work engagement', 'selection', 'optimization and compensation (SOC) theory', 'transactional and relational psychological contractHUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT', 'ECONOMIC EXCHANGE', 'MEASUREMENT ERROR', 'WORK PRACTICES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'OUTCOMES', 'METAANALYSIS', 'ATTITUDES', 'OPTIMIZATION', 'COMPENSATION']","['accommodative hrm', 'accommodative hrm', 'affective commitment', 'affective commitment', 'developmental hrm', 'developmental hrm', 'selection', 'outcomes', 'optimization', 'compensation']",workforce work psychological contract
"The present research leverages the irrational options theoretical framework to explore options rationality differences between salespeople and non-salespeople. Specifically, the reported research first examines (Study 1) whether or not salespeople are more likely to place a higher value on diminishing options than individuals who do not work in sales. Two follow-up studies embed a potential internal moderator (salesperson thinking style; Study 2) and a potential external moderator (performance-based incentives; Study 3) of salesperson valuations of diminishing options. The method employed in all three studies is an experimental design tailored after Shin and Ariely's (Management Science 50(5):575-586, 2004) seminal work on irrationality and options availability. The results demonstrate that, compared to non-salespeople, salespeople are more inclined to value option availability (Study 1), with this effect being especially pronounced for rule-bound thinkers (Study 2) and those operating under incentive-based compensation plans (Study 3). The article concludes by highlighting key managerial and theoretical implications, while acknowledging limitations and proposing directions for related, future work.","['Sales', 'Salespeople', 'Strategic decision making', 'Resources', 'Territory management', 'Performance', 'CustomersREAL OPTIONS', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'LOSS AVERSION', 'ESCALATION', 'CUSTOMER', 'DECISION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'IMPACT', 'MODEL', 'COMMITMENT']","['sales', 'salespeople', 'performance', 'management']",irrational options diminishing options compensation
"This paper analyzes data on 461 large U.S. industrial corporations to determine the factors that led large firms to participate in the wave of diversifying acquisitions that peaked in the late 1960s. We elaborate and test a class theory of corporate acquisitions, maintaining that firms pursued acquisitions in this period when they were commanded by well-networked challengers who were central in elite social networks but relatively marginal with respect to social status, isolated from the resistance of established elites, and free from control of owning families. We also consider a wide range of factors highlighted by alternative accounts of acquisition likelihood, including resource dependence, institutional pressures, and principal-agent conflicts. The results provide support for our main theoretical arguments, even when controls related to alternative explanations are taken into account.","['nanFREE CASH FLOW', 'AGENCY COSTS', 'INTERLOCKS', 'MERGER', 'OWNERSHIP', 'NETWORKS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'FIRM', 'ORGANIZATION', 'GOVERNANCE']","['networks', 'firm']",firms networks

Centrifugal and centripetal forces were indirectly related to performance through problem-solving outcomes, although some direct effects of these forces were also found.

"Customer satisfaction is universally acknowledged as a key driver of customer repurchase behavior, but recent evidence suggests that satisfaction has no effect on repurchase under certain circumstances. In this study, the authors develop a framework for understanding the complex relationships among satisfaction, moderating variables, and repurchase. They propose that the satisfaction repurchase link is subject to complementary and substitute effects and present satiation and inertia as key theoretical mechanisms that explain and predict those effects. In weak-satiation purchase categories, complementary effects are more likely, which suggests that managers should invest in customer satisfaction and complementary initiatives simultaneously. In strong-satiation purchase categories, substitute effects are more likely, which suggests that managers should invest in either customer satisfaction or substitute initiatives. An empirical test combining survey and longitudinal purchase data from two categories fashion apparel and automobile service provides a remarkable degree of support for the propositions. The findings offer new theoretical insights and substantive guidance for managers to effectively allocate resources to initiatives that complement or substitute for customer satisfaction.","['satiation', 'repurchase behavior', 'customer satisfaction', 'complementarity', 'substitutionSERVICE CONVENIENCE', 'CONSUMER LOYALTY', 'VARIETY SEEKING', 'DYNAMIC-MODEL', 'SHARE', 'RETENTION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INTENTIONS', 'EXCHANGES', 'SATIATION']","['satiation', 'repurchase behavior', 'repurchase behavior', 'customer satisfaction', 'customer satisfaction', 'satiation']",customer customer repurchase satiation inertia
"Moving beyond the dominant emphasis in the expatriate literature on adjustment problems, we integrate self-determination and relative deprivation theories to examine the role of thriving in the expatriate experience. Using data from 121 international teachers in the United States, we found that perceptions of job deprivation with respect to cultural instruction competence were negatively related to expatriate thriving. Perceptions of job deprivation with respect to autonomy and relatedness were more negatively associated with expatriate thriving when expatriates' emotional stability was low. Finally, thriving was a positive influence on expatriate engagement and actual retention beyond adjustment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"In emerging economies where the institutional environment is weak, the level of risk faced by MNEs remains high. Extant literature recognizes the forms of risks faced by MNEs, but only a few studies have attempted to explain how firms identify and mitigate these risks. This study addressed the commercial risk management strategies of MNEs operating in Vietnam. We found that the government remained the key stakeholder and maintaining active relations with them aided MNEs' operational success. The risk mitigation strategies employed by MNEs included managing alertness, portraying good behavior, navigating through the state of comfort, and active mediation.","['Risk mitigation', 'MNEs', 'Emerging economies', 'IBGRPOLITICAL RISK', 'STAKEHOLDER THEORY', 'INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS', 'QUALITATIVE RESEARCH', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LEGITIMACY', 'FRAMEWORK', 'VIETNAM']","['risk mitigation', 'risk mitigation', 'mnes', 'emerging economies', 'emerging economies', 'vietnam']",management mediation
"The issue of a published literature not representative of the population of research is most often discussed in terms of entire studies being suppressed. However, alternative sources of publication bias are questionable research practices (QRPs) that entail post hoc alterations of hypotheses to support data or post hoc alterations of data to support hypotheses. Using general strain theory as an explanatory framework, we outline the means, motives, and opportunities for researchers to better their chances of publication independent of rigor and relevance. We then assess the frequency of QRPs in management research by tracking differences between dissertations and their resulting journal publications. Our primary finding is that from dissertation to journal article, the ratio of supported to unsupported hypotheses more than doubled (0.82 to 1.00 versus 1.94 to 1.00). The rise in predictive accuracy resulted from the dropping of statistically nonsignificant hypotheses, the addition of statistically significant hypotheses, the reversing of predicted direction of hypotheses, and alterations to data.

"While there has been considerable research into the internationalisation of high-technology firms, it mostly assumes that these firms are pursuing global opportunities for technologies which are ready to be sold. This assumption does not hold for firms with 'new-to-the-world' technologies still under development. We investigate the internationalisation patterns of such firms by means of a qualitative case study. Our findings show the internationalisation patterns of the case firms to be uneven and discontinuous in nature. We attribute these patterns to the dialectical tensions which decision-makers confront between expanding internationally and developing their technologies. The nature and duration of the uncertainty inherent to bringing new-to-the-world technologies to global markets explains why tensions between innovation and internationalisation dominated, rather than synergies. In these conditions of fundamental uncertainty, the case firms were unable to benefit from the positive, self-reinforcing learning mechanism that underlies both the Uppsala internationalisation process model and the accelerated (early and rapid) internationalisation postulate. Instead, the dialectical process model which we develop recognises the socio-technical nature of technology, the impact of fundamental uncertainty, and the need to account for nonlinearity and interdependencies in the internationalisation process.","['case theoretic approaches', 'innovation and R&D', 'internationalisation', 'small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)', 'internationalisation theories and foreign market entryRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'BORN-GLOBAL FIRM', 'VENTURE INTERNATIONALIZATION', 'PROCESS MODEL', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'DIRECTIONS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'INDUSTRY', 'GROWTH']","['internationalisation', 'process model', 'process model']",uncertainty markets

Financial value of the ESOP was positively related to satisfaction with the ESOP plan, but was not related to other attitudinal variables. Perceived influence from ownership was positively related to ESOP satisfaction, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment.

"Alliance formation is commonplace in many high-technology industries experiencing radical technological change, where established firms use alliances with new entrants to adapt to technological change, while new entrants benefit from the ability of established players to commercialize the new technology. Despite the prevalence of these alliances, we know little about how these firms choose to ally with specific firms given the range of possible partners they may choose from. This study explores factors that lead to alliance formation between pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We focus on the alliance tie as the unit of analysis and argue that dyadic complementarities and similarities directly influence alliance formation. We then introduce a contingency model in which the positive effect of complementarities and similarities on alliance formation is moderated by the age of the new technology firm. We draw theoretical attention to the intersection between levels of analysis, in particular, the intersection between dyadic and firm-level constructs. We find that a pharmaceutical and a biotechnology firm are more likely to enter an alliance based on complementarities when the biotechnology firm is younger. Another noteworthy finding is that proxies for broad capabilities appear to be at least as effective, if not more so, in predicting alliance formation compared to fine-grained science and technology-related indicators, like patent cross-citations or patent common citations. We conclude by suggesting that future studies on alliance formation need to take into account interactions across levels; for example, how dyadic capabilities interact with firm-level factors, and the advantages and disadvantages of more or less fine-grained measures of organizational capabilities.

"Drawing on interviews, archival material, and observation, this article investigates how and why, on two different occasions, actors at the Carlsberg Group headquartered in Denmark were inspired to use a particular historical artifact, the Latin phrase Semper Ardens, carved above a doorway. Used first as the inspiration for naming a new line of handcrafted beers, ten years later it became the motto featured in the company's identity statement. Findings describe a temporal pattern of micro-level activities that accounts for how actors used this historical material and, in doing so, lent the authenticity of history to their actions, a phenomenon we term organizational historicizing. Analysis of historicizing activities revealed five micro-processes: rediscovering, recontextualizing, reclaiming, renewing, and re-embedding of an artifact in organizational history. Relationships between the micro-processes, explained in terms of authenticity, power, and identity, are theorized in a process model describing organizational historicizing. The findings show the importance of history when establishing claims to authenticity and how history becomes relevant to present and future activities. We also show that latent history can be revived for use in future historicizing.","['organizational history', 'historicizing', 'brewing industry', 'authenticity', 'organizational identity', 'Carlsberg GroupORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY', 'MEMORY', 'STRATEGIES', 'INVENTION', 'DYNAMICS', 'CULTURE']","['organizational history', 'organizational history', 'historicizing', 'authenticity']",model

"This research investigates the moderating effect of social capital on the conflict-innovation relationship and poses the argument that social interaction amplifies the beneficial effect of task conflict and the harmful effect of relationship conflict, whereas trust suppresses these effects. Analyses of a sample of 232 Canadian-based firms demonstrate that at higher levels of social interaction, the positive relationship between task conflict and innovation is stronger, and so is the negative relationship between relationship conflict and innovation. Furthermore, at higher levels of trust, the positive relationship between task conflict and innovation weakens.

"We analyse vertical boundaries of firms by identifying and comparing industrial, transactional and firm-specific factors in such a way that industrial organization, new institutional economics and the capability-based view are all taken into account. After testing the model in 155 firms in the Spanish meat industry, we observe that only factors associated with both transaction costs and capabilities have a statistical and economic relevance for explaining vertical integration. Firms vertically integrate to create specific investment between stages of the value chain, to internally exploit their pool of knowledge and capacities, and to guarantee quality of inputs and services employed. On the other hand, firms avoid high levels of vertical integration in the presence of high demand changes in order to stay flexible. Finally, providers or clients with market power do not seem to affect vertical boundaries in any consistent way.","['nanRAISING-RIVALS COSTS', 'BUY DECISIONS', 'INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE', 'APPROPRIABLE RENTS', 'SALES FORCE', 'FIRM', 'ORGANIZATION', 'INFORMATION', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'COMPETITION']","['firm', 'organization']",view integration
"This study advances our understanding of the contextualization of the effects of cultural intelligence (CQ). Drawing from trait activation theory and institutional theory, we develop a multi-level model showing how host countries' informal and formal openness towards foreigners facilitate or constrain the importance of expatriates' CQ in becoming embedded in the host organization. Furthermore, this study positions organizational embeddedness as a mediator in the association between expatriates' CQ and a central element of expatriates' jobs - knowledge sharing in the foreign workplace. Results from a cross-lagged survey of 1327 expatriates from 100 different nations residing in 30 host countries combined with secondary data indicate expatriate CQ relates positively to organizational embeddedness. Cross-level interaction analyses further suggest that in-group collectivism, the proxy for host countries' informal openness towards foreigners, facilitates the importance of CQ as a predictor of expatriates' organizational embeddedness. In contrast, CQ was not found to interact with the proxy for host countries' formal openness towards foreigners, i.e. national immigration policies. Consistent with predictions, we identified that CQ relates positively to knowledge sharing and that organizational embeddedness carries an indirect effect. We discuss the implications for theory and practice.","['expatriate management', 'cultural intelligence', 'in-group collectivism', 'immigration policies', 'organizational embeddedness', 'knowledge sharing', 'trait activation theory', 'multi-level analysisJOB EMBEDDEDNESS', 'INTERNATIONAL ADJUSTMENT', 'SOCIALIZATION TACTICS', 'TURNOVER INTENTIONS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SUPPORT', 'MODEL', 'PERSONALITY', 'NATIONALS', 'STAY']","['cultural intelligence', 'cultural intelligence', 'in group collectivism', 'in group collectivism', 'in group collectivism', 'immigration policies', 'immigration policies', 'organizational embeddedness', 'organizational embeddedness', 'knowledge sharing', 'knowledge sharing', 'trait activation theory', 'trait activation theory', 'trait activation theory', 'model']",cultural intelligence foreigners expatriates organizational embeddedness jobs workplace collectivism
"The literature on consumer choice between global and local brands is focused on sales-based measures of brand globalness (BG). When managers need to establish an effective social media campaign to raise awareness of their brands' activities on social media, the literature focus may not provide clear guidance on how such measures can be applied to social media. This research contributes to global brand research by combining the literature streams on consumer social media engagement and global branding marketing strategies. First, to provide a managerial tool for this task, the authors propose two novel measures, BG and country brand popularity (CBP), based on consumers' brand activities on social media. Using these measures, the authors hypothesize that CBP is influenced by cultural, social, and economic factors, which is motivated by motivation-opportunity-ability theory. Using Facebook data covering the top 100 brands that operate across 50 countries in each of 51 industries, they show that CBP is influenced by BG and cultural, social, and economic characteristics.","['brand', 'globalization', 'localization', 'multilevel model', 'social mediaCOUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN', 'LOCAL BRANDS', 'CULTURE', 'CONSUMERS', 'IMPACT', 'IMAGE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INFORMATION', 'PRODUCTS', 'DRIVERS']","['brand', 'local brands', 'local brands', 'consumers']",brand globalness social media engagement global branding country brand popularity
"Does asking people about their future behavior increase or decrease the likelihood that they will repeat their past behavior? In two laboratory and two field experiments, we find that behavior prediction strengthens behavior repetition, making people more likely to do what they normally do, when personal norms regarding engaging in a behavior are weak or not easily accessible. However, when personal norms are strong or made accessible at the time of the prediction request, behavior prediction weakens behavior repetition and increases the likelihood that people do what they think they should do-even if it's not what they normally would do. These findings provide new tools for influencing behavior repetition, reconcile some seemingly contradictory past findings, and contribute to the debate regarding the relative importance of habits and intentions in guiding behavior.","['nanSELF-GENERATED VALIDITY', 'MEASURING INTENT', 'REASONED ACTION', 'PROPHECY', 'PURCHASE', 'HABITS', 'SUSCEPTIBILITY', 'QUESTIONS', 'REQUESTS', 'ATTITUDE']",['habits'],behavior repetition
"The increasing globalization of business provides a compelling reason for understanding the cultural context of consumer behavior. The research reported here examines the impact of culture on consumers' perceptions of service recovery efforts. In particular, we studied in an experimental setting, across East-West cultures, the combined effects of explanation and compensation in shaping customers' attributions and post-recovery perceptions in a medium contact service-a restaurant setting. Our findings show that the differential sensitivity of East Asian and American consumers to situational constraints influence their attributions for service failures, and thus moderate their satisfaction with service recovery process. More specifically, the results suggest that a causal explanation for service failure decreases the likelihood of US consumers falling prey to the fundamental attribution error. Conversely, among East Asians, an explanation had minimal influence in attributional processes. Finally, our results indicate that attributional processes influence customer perceptions of employee effort, which in turn is linked to post-recovery satisfaction. (C) 2004 by New York University.

"By analyzing internationalization as a dynamic process, we attempt to explain the speed of international operations in terms of learning acquired in the course of past international activities. We consider that the speed of the internationalization process depends on the type of experiential learning that results from decisions implicit in the internationalization process: choice of location and modes of operation. Firms develop two types of learning activities with respect to the selection of foreign markets and modes of operation: diversity and depth of accumulated international activities. We propose that depth of international activities has an inverted U-shaped impact on the speed of the internationalization process, while diversity of international activities has a U-shaped influence on the speed of internationalization process. The results of our longitudinal study of 889 firms over 23 years (1986-2008) suggest that diversity of international activities promotes long-term learning by exposing the firm to richer experiences, although such learning only takes place over time. Depth of international activities may accelerate the internationalization process in the short term, but it eventually restrains its potential for development in the long term. Our research highlights the short-term vs long-term consequences of different types of decisions related to the internationalization process.","['speed of internationalization', 'diversity', 'depth', 'modes of operation', 'market selectionFOREIGN-MARKET', 'MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISES', 'FIRMS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'ENTRY', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'EXPLOITATION', 'LIABILITY', 'STRATEGY', 'SUCCESS']","['speed of internationalization', 'speed of internationalization', 'speed of internationalization', 'diversity', 'depth', 'modes of operation', 'modes of operation', 'modes of operation', 'firms']",choice firms
"Under increased scrutiny from top management and shareholders, marketing managers feel the need to measure and communicate the impact of their actions on shareholder returns. In particular, how do customer value creation (through product innovation) and customer value communication (through marketing investments) affect stock returns? This article examines, conceptually and empirically, how product innovations and marketing investments for such product innovations lift stock returns by improving the outlook on future cash flows. The authors address these questions with a large-scale econometric analysis of product innovation and associated marketing mix in the automobile industry. They find that adding such marketing actions to the established finance benchmark model greatly improves the explained variance in stock returns. In particular, investors react favorably to companies that launch pioneering innovations, that have higher perceived quality, that are backed by substantial advertising support, and that are in large and growing categories. Finally, the authors quantify and compare the stock return benefits of several managerial control variables. The results highlight the stock market benefits of pioneering innovations. Compared with minor updates, pioneering innovations have an impact on stock returns that is seven times greater, and their advertising support is nine times more effective as well. Perceived quality of the new car introduction improves the firm's stock returns, but customer liking does not have a statistically significant effect. Promotional incentives have a negative effect on stock returns, indicating that price promotions may be interpreted as a signal of demand weakness. Managers can combine these return estimates with internal data on project costs to help decide the appropriate mix of product innovation and marketing investment.","['marketing investments', 'advertising', 'financial performance', 'product innovations', 'stock returns', 'marketing and firm value', 'stock return response modelsSHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'CAPITAL-MARKETS', 'BRAND ATTITUDE', 'ENTRY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'IMPACT', 'MIX', 'INTRODUCTIONS', 'INCUMBENCY', 'MANAGEMENT']","['marketing investments', 'marketing investments', 'advertising', 'product innovations', 'product innovations', 'stock returns', 'stock returns', 'impact', 'mix', 'management']",impact innovation
"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and organic growth are two common strategies to achieve horizontal growth. In this study, we disentangle two distinct sources of firm performance corresponding to different theoretical perspectives on firm size: firms' bargaining power with respect to suppliers and customers, and operating efficiency arising from scale economies. We conceptually argue and empirically show that relatively, M&A enhance bargaining power in the short term while organic growth enhances operating efficiency over the long term. In order to disaggregate these effects, we use accounting rather than financial or managerial data and test our predictions in the global retail industry over a 20-year period. We examine implications of these results for sustainability of size-based competitive advantages.

"Joint venturing is recommended to avoid some of the obstacles to successful business venturing, such as capability limitations and organizational resistance. However, the high dissolution rates for joint ventures suggest a need to learn how to utilize this cooperative strategy more effectively. Two frequently reported problem areas in joint venturing are unrealistic corporate expectations and inadequate planning. Thus, this study sought to examine the impact of strategic intent on joint venture success as measured by partner goal achievement and satisfaction. A review of the literature on strategic goals and goal consensus suggested that two variables are likely to affect joint venture performance: the number of partner goals pursued and the overlap in partners' goals. The type of goals pursued may also affect performance; that is, some goals may be more achievable through joint venturing than are other goals The purpose of this research was two-fold. (1) to empirically explore the relative importance of a variety of partner goals for their joint ventures, and (2) to determine if goal disparity, and the number and type of goals pursued affected joint venture success. This approach draws attention to the expectations of partners rather than to the venture itself, the traditional focus in entrepreneurship. The hypotheses and exploratory propositions were tested using data from U.S. firms involved in manufacturing joint ventures. A categorization of partner goals was developed through factor analysis, in which five categories of goals emerged knowledge transfer, market power financial performance, efficiency, and financial structure. Partners were found to have pursued multiple goals simultaneously, with knowledge transfer and market goals being most frequently rated as critically important. These findings suggest the need to expand traditional performance measures to account for the diverse and nonfinancial nature of partner goals. When examined separately, it was found that a large goal set facilitated partner goal achievement and satisfaction, and that an overlap in partners' goals promoted partner satisfaction. The large goal set was argued to be necessary in the volatile environments that are often attractive for joint venturing. A large goal set reflects adaptation to environmental change and facilitates prudent strategy selection by subjecting alternatives to multiple goal hurdles. The overlap in partners' goals reflects a meshing of individual partner goals and helps to minimize conflict, which could stall strategy development and drain resources. However, when an integrated model was developed from multiple regression findings, the overlap in partners' goals became a moderator variable. This model exposed the negative as well as the positive effects of the overlap in partners' goals. Analysis further suggested that the joint venture strategy may be better suited to achieving efficiency goals than financial goals. Possible explanations for the difficulty in achieving financial goals include: insufficient time (or short lifespan of the joint venture), the complex structure inherent in joint ventures, and the possibility of disagreement between the partners about how the financial goals should be achieved. On the other hand, efficiency goals, such as vertical integration and economies of scale, require expansion or extension of operations and thus fit well with the pooling of skills and resources that are characteristic of joint venturing. Further, both partners contribute to and gain from efficiency goals, unlike with market access or knowledge transfer goals where one firm contributes more than it gains or vice versa for that particular goal. Additional analysis revealed that the goal types explained more variance in partner goal achievement and satisfaction than did the size of goal sets or the extent of overlap in partners' goals. Taken in combination, the various aspects of partners' goals explained 26% of the variance in partner goal achievement and 38% of the variance in partner satisfaction. When partner goal achievement was included in the multiple regression model for partner satisfaction, the amount of explained variance increased to 69%. The results suggest that a partner firm may be able to significantly enhance its chances of judging a joint venture to be successful if its goals focus on efficiency rather than revenues and profits, if it has a relatively large goal set, and if it concentrates on achieving the set of stated goals.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL-EFFECTIVENESS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONSENSUS', 'STRATEGY', 'UNCERTAINTY']","['performance', 'consensus', 'strategy']",impact consensus performance firms
"Manufacturers across many industries use service infusion to address the changing customer demands and improve their competitive position. However, understanding the drivers of successful service infusion is a complex process. Using business model and configuration theories, this study conceptualizes and analyzes the interplay of different driver domains for suppliers, customers, and their business relationships. In particular, we analyze how service offering, service pricing, service capabilities, and the service infusion process interact in affecting service infusion success and failure. 137 interviews relating to 25 business relationships are analyzed via configuration analysis, particularly fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Results show that different equifinal configurations exist (i.e., different ways to succeed with service infusion). We also find that more is not always better. For example, service infusion success can be achieved without fully developed service capabilities. In addition, successful configurations are often very similar to those leading to failure. A dyadic analysis demonstrates that customer service capabilities are overall more important than those of suppliers. From these findings, we derive priorities for future research. In particular, our study points toward the need to better understand the interplay between service infusion drivers. Second, we advocate the augmentation of research perspectives in service infusion by taking into account the supplier, customer, and dyadic perspectives. Lastly, the importance of understanding drivers of service infusion failure is highlighted. For managers, our study shows the importance of relational audits as a starting point to deciding on how to infuse services in a business relationship.","['service infusion', 'configurations', 'business model', 'dyadic perspective', 'service capabilities', 'servitization', 'hybrid offeringQUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS', 'COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS QCA', 'BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'RESEARCH PRIORITIES', 'TRANSITION', 'PRODUCT', 'ORIENTATION', 'STRATEGIES', 'OFFERINGS']","['service infusion', 'service infusion', 'configurations', 'business model', 'business model', 'dyadic perspective', 'dyadic perspective', 'service capabilities', 'service capabilities']",service infusion business model pricing capabilities fsqca

"This research investigates the interrelationship between service characteristics and switching costs and makes two contributions to the service retailing literature: (1) As a means of better understanding the effectiveness of switching costs, the study suggests a two-dimensional typology of switching costs, including internal and external switching costs and (2) it reveals that the effect of these switching costs on customer loyalty is contingent upon four service characteristics (the IHIP characteristics of service). We carried out a meta-analytic review of the literature on the switching costs-customer loyalty link and created a hierarchical linear model using a sample of 1,694 customers from 51 service industries. Results reveal that external switching costs have a stronger average effect on customer loyalty than do internal switching costs. Moreover, we find that IHIP characteristics moderate the links between switching costs and customer loyalty. Thus, the link between external switching costs and customer loyalty is weaker in industries higher in the four service characteristics (as compared to industries lower in these characteristics), while the opposite moderating effect of service characteristics for the internal switching costs loyalty link is noted.

"A substantial body of research evidence has now accumulated in the reference price literature. One stream of research has identified the antecedents of reference price and has assessed their effects through experimentation. Others have calibrated a variety of reference price models on panel data and reported the effects on brand choice and other purchase decisions. In this article, the authors review the published literature on reference price in both the behavioral and modeling streams. They offer an integrative framework to review prior research on (1) the formation of reference price, (2) retrieval and use of reference price, and (3) influences of reference price on various purchase decisions and evaluations. In doing so, the authors examine the influences of consumers' prior purchase history and contextual moderators, such as specific purchase occasions, promotional environment of the store, and product category characteristics. They summarize the key findings, identify the unresolved issues, and offer an agenda for further research, which includes a set of testable propositions. They also identify the methodological challenges that face reference price research. In the concluding section, the authors discuss the managerial implications of reference price research.","['nanEXTERNAL REFERENCE PRICES', 'CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS', 'BRAND CHOICE', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'CONTEXTUAL INFLUENCES', 'LOSS AVERSION', 'MODEL', 'FREQUENCY', 'PROMOTION', 'CATEGORY']","['brand choice', 'brand choice', 'model', 'promotion', 'category']",models choice
"We examine call option rights as a contractual clause in international joint ventures (IJVs) and propose that the assignment of the call option right in an IJV is determined by certain ex ante asymmetries between the partners. Results show that between the two partners in an IJV, the firm with greater complementarity with the venture and greater prior IJV experience is more likely to hold the call option right; in addition, the firm's contractual choice on the call option right and its ownership choice on a greater initial equity stake are substitutive. Our focus on explicit call options advances the real options theory of collaborative agreements, and our results also highlight that option rights be considered an important part of alliance design.

"Making agency theory institutionally sensitive is a reasonable suggestion, as far as normal science stands. However, we argue that such a move has already been taking place, that it cannot address important problems with agency theory, and that the time is ripe for a critical re-examination of this theory. We suggest that inductive studies can not only be more sensitive to institutional features than deductive studies, but they can also offer deeper understanding of governance practices in specific contexts, as well as the potential for analytical or moderatum generalizations. Drawing from legal theory, we offer an alternative conception of the principal, and of the role and status of the board of directors. We contend that this reformulated agency theory has a greater potential of being institutionally sensitive because it recognizes various stakeholders as team members, rather than just adding specific institutional features as variables to the dominant conception of agency theory.","['abduction', 'agency theory', 'board of directors', 'induction', 'legal perspectiveCORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'TEAM PRODUCTION-MODEL', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'STAKEHOLDER THEORY', 'GOVERNANCE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'SHAREHOLDER', 'BUSINESS', 'BOARD', 'RESPONSIBILITY']","['agency theory', 'agency theory', 'board of directors', 'board of directors', 'board of directors', 'governance', 'board']",directors
"In this study we present evidence that geographic diversification increases shareholder value and improves long-term performance when firms engage in core-related foreign direct (greenfield) investments. Non-core-related foreign investments are found to be associated with both short-term and long-term losses. Our results suggest that the synergy gains stemming from the internalization of markets are rooted in the core business of the firm. Geographic diversification outside the core business of the firm bears strongly against the prediction of the internalization hypothesis. The analysis also shows that, regardless of the industrial structure of the firm (that is, number of segments), foreign direct investments outside the core business of the firm are associated with a loss in shareholder value, whereas core-related (focused) foreign direct investments are found to be value increasing. Unrelated international diversification, however, is less harmful for diversified (multi-segment) than specialized (single-segment) firms. The larger gains to diversified firms suggest that operational and internal capital market efficiency gains are considerably greater in multi-segment than single-segment firms when both expand their core business overseas.","['foreign direct investments', 'industrial and international diversification', 'short-term and long-term performance', 'diversified and specialized firmsCONGLOMERATE MERGER WAVE', 'CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION', 'FINANCING POLICIES', 'MARKET VALUATION', 'STOCK RETURNS', 'CASH FLOW', 'TOBIN Q', 'OWNERSHIP', 'ACQUISITIONS', 'DECISIONS']","['foreign direct investments', 'foreign direct investments', 'foreign direct investments']",geographic diversification firms internalization structure
"Advances in frontline interface technologies and devices are profoundly disrupting how organizations and customers interact to create and exchange value. Where once customer interactions were limited in variety, multiplicity, and complexity, today's broadband Internet and wireless connection technologies defy limitations to enable organization-customer interactions of everincreasing diversity and consistency across multiple points of customer contact. No longer are the frontlines inert backgrounds for organizational action involving customers; rather, they are evolving as sites of vibrant innovations and interventions that engage customers, enhance customer experiences, and motivate value (co) creation. To anchor this emergent field, we define organizational frontlines at the intersection of interfaces and interactions that connect organizations and their customers. We historically trace the use of organizational frontlines'' from its initial application in military and management domains through its current and proposed position in both academic and practitioner contexts. We illustrate our definition to highlight research opportunities and underscore the strategic implications for effectively managing organizational frontlines to secure competitive advantage.

We test the relative influence of power and social embeddedness in mobilizing resources between newly-formed businesses and other organizations by re-examining longitudinal data from the Van de yen and Walker (1984) study of interorganizational relations. We find that resource flows to entrepreneurial ventures are predicted by the total dependence between parties engaged in the creation of value: they are not predicted by dependence advantage (or disadvantage) between the parties. We discuss the implications and propose that a theory of joint resource mobilization may be more useful than a theory of unilateral resource acquisition for understanding how new ventures access external resources.

"During the past two decades, service guarantees have received increased attention as a means for service firms to attract and retain customers and gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. Although many academic studies, referring to diverse service guarantee aspects, have appeared during this time, a synthesis of research is needed to clarify what researchers have learned about service guarantees and what remains unknown. To evaluate the state of published research on service guarantees, 109 articles published from 1985 to 2008 are collected and analyzed. The resultant review reveals a significant change in the type of research being performed, including a shift toward greater interest in the impact of service guarantees on consumer behavior and service firms. However, a significant shortfall marks empirical work directed toward the internal and operational effects of service guarantees. The effects of service guarantees on service performance, service recovery, and return on service guarantee investments are topics in need of further research.","['service guarantees', 'research synthesis', 'service marketing', 'service recoveryPRICE-MATCHING GUARANTEES', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'CONSUMER RESPONSES', 'DOMINANT LOGIC', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'BUSINESS ETHICS', 'OPPORTUNISM', 'QUALITY', 'WARRANTY', 'ANTECEDENTS']","['service guarantees', 'service guarantees']",service guarantees service recovery
"Purpose - This paper proposes a framework that considers some key concepts to design and manage supply chains in both national and international contexts. For a better understanding, it is intended to illustrate this framework with the case of Carrefour in both Spain and China.

The paper also discusses similarities and differences in the supply chain management in both contexts. Findings - The paper found application of core SCM concepts to a leader distribution firm. Thinking global and acting local is also pertinent to application in the management of supply chains. Practical implications - Managers may identify key processes and consider the possible contributions of each to the efficiency of their own chains. This case study could be also used as an example of the successful management of the supply chain of a company leader in its sector.

"Statistical mediation analysis has become the technique of choice in consumer research to make causal inferences about the influence of a treatment on an outcome via one or more mediators. This tutorial aims to strengthen two weak links that impede statistical mediation analysis from reaching its full potential. The first weak link is the path from mediator to outcome, which is a correlation. Six conditions are described that this correlation needs to meet in order to make plausible causal inferences: directionality, reliability, unconfoundedness, distinctiveness, power, and mediation. Recommendations are made to increase the plausibility of causal inferences based on statistical mediation analysis. Sweetspot analysis is proposed to establish whether an observed mediator-outcome correlation falls within the region of statistically meaningful correlations. The second weak link is the communication of mediation results. Four components of informative communication of mediation analysis are described: effect decomposition, effect size, difference testing, and data sharing. Recommendations are made to improve the communication of mediation analysis. A review of 166 recently published mediation analyses in the Journal of Consumer Research, a reanalysis of two published datasets, and Monte Carlo simulations support the conclusions and recommendations.","['mediation analysis', 'causal inference', 'experiment', 'bias', 'knowledge accumulationSOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL-RESEARCH', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'STATISTICAL POWER', 'CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS', 'SAMPLE-SIZE', 'RECOMMENDATIONS', 'ERROR', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'METAANALYSIS', 'HYPOTHESES']","['mediation analysis', 'mediation analysis', 'causal inference', 'causal inference', 'recommendations']",causal inferences sweetspot analysis

"We present a self-enhancement model of workplace incivility to account for the effects of exposure to incivility on task performance. In particular, we predict that workplace incivility thwarts the ability to self-enhance at work, resulting in employees' divesting their sense of self from work via disengagement processes. Maintaining high levels of task performance subsequently ceases to be a source of self-enhancement for employees who have disengaged their sense of self from work. We also examined the extent to which the desire for self-enhancement (i.e., narcissism) moderated the effect of incivility on engagement. Using two sets of multiwave, multisource data collected in China, our results provide full support for our hypotheses and provide new theoretical directions for incivility research.","['nanLEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'ABUSIVE SUPERVISION', 'WORK ENGAGEMENT', 'INTERPERSONAL MISTREATMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'IN-ROLE', 'NARCISSISM']",['narcissism'],self enhancement workplace incivility task performance enhancement narcissism
"Product management is one of the most important functions in marketing. Yet the product management literature has focused largely on creating successful products and has relatively little to say about creating effective product management organizations. This paper focuses on the organizational determinants of high-performance product management at three levels: ( 1) the product manager as an individual; ( 2) the marketing processes related to product management; and ( 3) the organization structure and role definition. The paper identifies several key factors that potentially impact product management performance. A set of qualitative interviews is conducted to develop hypotheses related to constructs that may drive product management performance. These hypotheses are used to develop a causal model for product management performance that includes constructs related to roles and responsibilities, organization structure, and marketing processes related to product management. An empirical survey of 198 product managers from a variety of industries is conducted to test the causal model. The results of the causal model suggest that performance of a product management organization is driven by structural barriers in the organization, the quality of marketing processes, roles and responsibilities, and knowledge and competencies. The findings suggest that structural boundaries and interfaces are the biggest impediment to effective product management, followed by clarity of roles and responsibilities. The research highlights the importance of organization structure and effective human resource practices in improving product management performance.","['nanEQUATION MODELS', 'INDUSTRIAL', 'DETERMINANTS', 'NPD']",['determinants'],
"Coordinating in action groups consists of continuously adapting behaviors in response to fluctuating conditions, ideally with limited disruption to a group's collective performance. Through an 18-month ethnography of how members of a community choir maintained beautiful, ongoing performance, I explored how they continuously adapted their coordinating, starting when they felt that their collective performance was fragmented or falling apart. The process model I developed shows that this aesthetic experience-the sense of fragmentation based on inputs from the bodily senses-leads to emotional triggering, meaning group members' emotions prompt changes in their attention and behavior. They then distribute their attention in new ways, increasing their focus on both global qualities of their ongoing performance (in this context, the musical score and conductor) and local qualities (singers' contributions). My findings suggest that by changing what aspects of a situation compose their immediate experience, action group members can adapt their coordinating behaviors by changing their heed: the behavior that demonstrates their attentiveness and awareness. The intertwining of attention and emotions helps explain how groups move between heedless and heedful interrelating over time, leading to an aesthetic experience of collective performance as being whole or coherent. My research shows that embodied forms of cognition (what we know from direct experience of an environment) complement accounts of how representational forms of knowledge (what we know from symbols, concepts, or ideas) facilitate real-time adaptation in groups. These insights have implications for a range of organizations engaged in complex action group work.","['coordinating', 'action groups', 'aesthetic experience', 'attention', 'emotionPOSITIVE EMOTIONS', 'COGNITIVE-ABILITY', 'TEAM COMPOSITION', 'HIGH-RELIABILITY', 'MENTAL MODELS', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'ATTENTION', 'MUSIC', 'WORK', 'PERCEPTION']","['coordinating', 'action groups', 'action groups', 'aesthetic experience', 'aesthetic experience', 'attention', 'organizations', 'attention', 'music', 'work']",model experience attention research
"This study examines strategic decision-making at the boardroom level of two non-profit professional associations, penetrating directors' strategic orientations, discourse and decisions in their holistic context. In comparison with the predominantly survey and interview based literature on board level strategy behaviour, this study employs a longitudinal complete member researcher, participant observer methodology. Its findings are analysed from an institutional theory perspective and reveal selective championing of strategies by directors, the evaluation of strategic proposals and progress in predominantly financial resource/outcome terms, and directors' attention to navigating strategic initiatives through organizational politics. Also revealed are private sector philosophies imported into the non-profit boardroom, the predominantly ceremonial role of formal strategic plans, and an informally enacted strategic discourse. This study offers a unique insider view of strategizing at the highest organizational level.","['nanCORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'DIRECTORS', 'TOP', 'POWER', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'SEEKING']",['directors'],decision making organizational politics
"The authors examine the impact of a firm's innovation by analyzing its position in a global research-and-development network and its orientation toward using scientific knowledge (science intensity). Drawing on organizational learning and network theory research, they focus on the moderating role of a firm's network position in the relationship between the firm's science intensity and the impact of its innovation. Data derived from the global pharmaceutical industry indicate that a firm's science intensity enhances the impact of its innovation by facilitating effective search. This relationship is reinforced when the firm has network resources derived from an efficient network position. These results support the idea that the impact of innovation is strengthened when internal research capability and external network resources are combined. This study, which is conducted in a global industry network context, also enables the authors to examine the role of international gatekeepers in bridging ties across U.S., Japanese, and European geographic boundaries.","['research-and-development alliances', 'science intensity', 'network resources', 'innovation impactKNOWLEDGE', 'EXPLORATION', 'CAPABILITIES', 'EXPLOITATION', 'SCIENCE']","['science intensity', 'science intensity', 'network resources', 'network resources', 'science']",firm research and development network knowledge ties
"Prior research on relative thinking has suggested that the willingness to seek a bargain depends not only on the absolute value of the bargain but also on the price of the product. For example, a discount of $10 seems more appealing on a product whose regular price is $20 than a product whose regular price is $60. By invoking the interactive role of consumers' reference prices, the authors delineate the specific conditions under which the same $10 discount can seem less appealing when the price is $20 than when it is $60. They present a formal model that simultaneously incorporates the effects of relative and referent thinking and yields novel predictions, which are supported in four laboratory experiments. Their results reveal that deviation from the reference price determines when relative thinking holds and when it gets reversed. Specifically, the relative-thinking effect holds when the actual price is the same as expected, it reverses when the actual price deviates from the expected price, but it emerges again when deviation from the expected price becomes extreme. The authors conclude with the theoretical and managerial implications of their findings for marketing activities, such as the allocation of sales promotion budgets.","['behavioral decision theory', 'sales promotions', 'consumer behaviorPRICE EXPECTATIONS', 'BRAND CHOICE', 'REFERENCE DEPENDENCE', 'PROSPECT-THEORY', 'LOSS AVERSION', 'CONSUMER', 'MODEL', 'PSYCHOPHYSICS', 'PROBABILITY', 'PERCEPTIONS']","['consumer', 'model']",relative thinking reference prices model
"We explore transaction cost economics (TCE) and real option (RO) rationales for alliance governance and find the predictive power of each depends upon the type of uncertainty confronted. Our review of alliance activity from 1995 through 2000 for 642 alliances confirms that governance is influenced directly by partner, task, and technological uncertainty and by interactions among asset co-specialization, partner uncertainty, and task uncertainty. Consistent with TCE, co-specialized assets increased the likelihood of hierarchical governance. Partner and task uncertainty increased this effect. Consistent with RO, we find technological uncertainty decreased the likelihood of hierarchical governance.

"For a new product development (NPD) organization, a little conflict can be a good thing. Healthy disagreements can push project team members or different functional groups in an organization to pursue more in-depth, insightful analysis. This type of creative tension can help to engender an environment that encourages innovation and thus keeps NPD efforts free from the business-as-usual doldrums. However, management must ensure that conflict remains on a healthy level. David H. Gobeli, Harold F. Koenig, and Iris Bechinger note that conflict must be managed not only to increase the satisfaction of project team members, but also to achieve strategic project success. To provide better understanding of the important issues in conflict management, they examine the effects of three conflict factors on software development project success: context, conflict intensity, and conflict management style. Using survey responses from 117 software professionals and managers, they develop a multi-level framework of success versus conflict for team-based, software development projects. Within this framework, they examine context, conflict intensity, and conflict management approaches at the team and organization levels. For the participants in this study, unresolved conflict has a strong, negative effect on overall software product success and customer satisfaction. Project team member satisfaction decreases substantially with higher intensity conflict at the organization level, and even more strongly at the project level. For the respondents to this study, the combined effects of conflict intensity and conflict management style on project success are significant, but they are not as great as the combined effects of such context variables, as company goals, group dynamics, and management support. Two conflict management styles-confronting and give and take-have beneficial effects on success at the organization level for the firms in this study. Smoothing, withdrawal, and forcing all have negative effects, although only forcing has a statistically significant negative effect In general terms, the results suggest that management should guard against frequent use of the dysfunctional management styles-withdrawal, smoothing, and forcing. The results suggest that emphasis on confrontation-that is, true problem solving-is essential at the project level, even if a give-and-take style is better tolerated at the organization level.

"The corporate governance literature on potential remedies for the agency problem has focused largely on external control mechanisms, especially board independence. We instead consider how an internal, psychological factor-CEO organizational identification-may influence the extent to which firms incur agency costs, including those entailed by the decoupling of CEO pay and perquisites from firm performance. Our theory and findings explain why a CEO with high organizational identification may avoid pursuit of personal gains that can harm the firm he or she leads and its image. We further show how board independence is less likely to reduce agency costs when CEO organizational identification is high.","['nanSTRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING', 'TOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS', 'INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'BOARD STRUCTURE', 'INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS', 'MANAGERIAL INCENTIVES']","['corporate governance', 'corporate governance', 'firm performance', 'firm performance']",governance performance
"Growing concern about the sustainability of the natural environment is rapidly transforming the competitive landscape and forcing companies to explore the costs and benefits of greening their marketing mix. We develop and test a theoretical model that predicts (1) the role of green marketing programs in influencing firm performance, (2) the impact of slack resources and top management risk aversion on the deployment of such programs, and (3) the conditioning effects that underpin these relationships. Our analyses show that green marketing programs are being implemented by firms, and we find evidence of significant performance payoffs. Specifically the results indicate that green product and distribution programs positively affect firms' product-market performance, while green pricing and promotion practices are directly positively related to firms' return on assets. In addition, industry-level environmental reputation moderates the links between green marketing program components and firms' product-market and financial performance. Finally, we find that slack resources and top management risk aversion are independently conducive to the adoption of green marketing programs-but operate as substitutes for each other.","['Green marketing', 'Firm performance', 'Stakeholder theory', 'Slack resources', 'Industry reputation', 'Risk aversion', 'Competitive intensityCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES', 'MANAGERIAL PERCEPTIONS', 'STRATEGIC PERSISTENCE', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'BUSINESS PERFORMANCE', 'NATURAL-ENVIRONMENT', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'SLACK RESOURCES', 'SUSTAINABILITY']","['green marketing', 'green marketing', 'firm performance', 'firm performance', 'slack resources', 'slack resources', 'risk aversion', 'risk aversion', 'financial performance', 'financial performance', 'natural environment', 'natural environment', 'slack resources', 'slack resources', 'sustainability']",firm performance slack resources top management risk aversion
"Consumers typically infer greater quantity from larger numbers. For instance, a 500 gram box of chocolates appears heavier than a .5 kilogram box. By expressing quantities in alternative units or attribute dimensions, one can represent an otherwise identical quantity in a more versus less discretized manner (e.g., a box containing 25 chocolates vs. a box weighing 500 grams). Seven experimental studies show that a difference between more discretized quantities (e.g., 25 vs. 50 chocolates) appears larger relative to a difference between less discretized quantities (e.g., 500 grams vs. 1,000 grams), above and beyond effects of number magnitude. More discretized quantity expressions enhance the consumers' ability to discriminate between choice options and can also nudge consumers to more favorable choices. Because more discretized quantities are more evaluable, expressing a quantity in terms of a collection of elements particularly helps individuals who are less numerically proficient. By identifying how discretization functions as a novel antecedent of evaluability and by distinguishing two different conceptualizations of numerosity (i.e., symbolic and perceptual numerosity), this article draws important connections between the numerical cognition literature and General Evaluability Theory.","['numerosity', 'numerical cognition', 'framing effects', 'units', 'evaluability', 'judgment and decision making', 'nudgeNUMEROSITY DISCRIMINATION', 'PERCEIVED NUMEROSITY', 'PREFERENCE REVERSALS', 'SEPARATE EVALUATIONS', 'REWARD', 'EVALUABILITY', 'PERCEPTION', 'MAGNITUDE', 'FREQUENCY', 'NUMBERS']","['numerosity', 'numerical cognition', 'numerical cognition', 'units', 'evaluability', 'evaluability', 'magnitude', 'numbers']",numerical cognition
"Cryptocurrencies are a hotly debated topic because it is not clear why they should be valued as they are. Bitcoin, by far the most prominent cryptocurrency, currently trades around $9,500 USD. Why is Bitcoin valuable? is a question often heard but seldom answered well. It is not the legal tender of any nation, nor does it represent anything of physical or intrinsic value. Some people attribute its value to its scarcity, others to its anonymity, and others to its immutability, all of which are created and managed by a computer algorithm. Current theories fail to explain Bitcoin's value, or it is not immediately apparent how they might explain it. We are therefore motivated to investigate the sources of cryptocurrency value through the emergent value systems of the Bitcoin community. We use concourse theory and Q-methodology to discover five types of Bitcoin value systems that are complementary and coexisting facets of a collective whole, each type being its own internally consistent theory of value, and therefore our typology avoids simplistic generalizations about cryptocurrencies and the motivations behind those involved. We named the types: Fintech, Libertarians, Purists, Average Joe, and Gentrifier. Of interest, four of the five types we identified appear not to value Bitcoin for its monetary or market value, despite what is usually assumed. Instead, Bitcoin is associated with its potential as an alternative currency that may be used to exchange value, to mitigate various forms of risk, or as a force for social and cultural change. These five types may also underlie broader digital innovation processes and provide a basis from which to understand them.","['Abductive reasoning', 'Bitcoin', 'concourse theory', 'cryptocurrency', 'Q-methodology', 'Q-sort', 'subjective value', 'value', 'value systems', 'virtual currencyOWNERSHIP', 'MONEY']","['bitcoin', 'concourse theory', 'concourse theory', 'cryptocurrency', 'q methodology', 'q methodology', 'value', 'value systems', 'value systems']",cryptocurrencies systems concourse theory
"The issue of corporate control is examined through an analysis of the de-diversification activity of publicly held American firms from 1985 to 1994. Prominent accounts of such behavior depict newly powerful shareholders as having demanded a dismantling of the inefficient, highly diversified corporate strategies that arose in the late 1950s and the 1960s. This paper highlights an additional factor that spurred such divestiture: the need to present a coherent product identity in the stock market. It is argued that because they straddle the industry categories that investors-and securities analysts, who specialize by industry-use to compare like assets, diversified firms hinder efforts at valuing their shares. As a result, managers of such firms face pressure from analysts to dediversity so that their stock is more easily understood. Results indicate that, in addition to such factors as weak economic performance, de-diversification is more likely when a firm's stock price is low and there is a significant mismatch between its corporate strategy and the identity attributed to the firm by analysts.","['nanFIRM', 'PERFORMANCE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'INDUSTRY', 'IDENTITY', 'RETURNS', 'MARKET', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'DYNAMICS']","['performance', 'industry', 'identity', 'market']",firms analysts performance

"Research suggests that organizational members highly prize respect but rarely report adequately receiving it. However, there is a lack of theory in organizational behavior regarding what respect actually is and why members prize it. We argue that there are two distinct types of respect: generalized respect is the sense that we are all valued in this organization, and particularized respect is the sense that the organization values me for particular attributes, behaviors, and achievements. We build a theoretical model of respect, positing antecedents of generalized respect from the sender's perspective (prestige of social category, climate for generalized respect) and proposed criteria for the evaluation of particularized respect (role, organizational member, and character prototypicality), which is then enacted by the sender and perceived by the receiver. We also articulate how these two types of respect fulfill the receiver's needs for belonging and status, which facilitates the self-related outcomes of organization-based self-esteem, organizational and role identification, and psychological safety. Finally, we consider generalized and personalized respect jointly and present four combinations of the two types of respect. We argue that the discrepancy between organizational members' desired and received respect is partially attributable to the challenge of simultaneously enacting or receiving respect for both the we and the me.","['respect', 'identity', 'status', 'belonging', 'organization-based self-esteem', 'identification', 'psychological safetyLEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY THEORY', 'SELF-ESTEEM', 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE', 'PERCEIVED RESPECT', 'INTEGRATIVE MODEL', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'WORK', 'ENGAGEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE']","['respect', 'status', 'belonging', 'organization based self esteem', 'organization based self esteem', 'organization based self esteem', 'organization based self esteem', 'identification', 'self esteem', 'self esteem', 'identification']",prototypicality self esteem role identification psychological safety

"In this study, we draw on industrial organization and institutional research to explore the relationship between market convergence and standardization of advertising programs. We argue that environmental isomorphism, which maintains that the external market environment is a principal driver of firms' institutional structures, places pressure on firms to adapt their organizational structures and strategies to changing institutional conditions. We propose that the convergence associated with European market integration will lead firms to emphasize three advertising strategies: creating a uniform brand image, appealing to cross-market segments, and increasing cost performance in advertising. Further, we hypothesize that these strategies will be associated with an overall tendency to standardize advertising strategy and execution. Results of a survey of managers of subsidiaries of Japanese and U.S. firms operating in the EU suggest that firms that believe the EU is converging are more likely to engage in these standardized advertising strategies. Additionally, our findings suggest that firms that seek to create a uniform brand image and appeal to cross-market segments are more likely to standardize their overall advertising programs. Finally, we find that firms' desire to create a uniform brand image is a function of their goal of building brand equity, regardless of the level to which markets converge. We draw implications for research and practice regarding firm responses to market convergence. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

"This paper provides a conceptual model that explains how competitive and institutional dynamics at the community level influence the ability of welfare-oriented nonprofits to eradicate income inequality. To test our framework, we build a large and unique seven-year panel dataset consisting of data from 245 U.S. communities. We find that increasing the number of welfare nonprofits is beneficial for reducing community inequality, but only up to a point, after which resource competition decreases their effectiveness. This competition for resources is also present when a high density of elite-oriented nonprofits operates in the same community. Hypotheses focused on the institutional dimension receive mixed support. As predicted, welfare nonprofits are more effective when they operate in communities with strong law enforcement capabilities and less effective in politically conservative local contexts. Contrary to our expectations, however, we find that welfare nonprofits are less effective in demographically heterogeneous local contexts and when the government provides effective social policies, thus indicating a possible substitution effect. Surprisingly, nonprofit effectiveness is increased in highly financialized local contexts. Together, our results indicate that issues of competition, institutional alignment, and community support in the context of grand challenges are more complex than originally thought.","['nanSTRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'UNITED-STATES', 'ROBUST ACTION', 'COMPETITION', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'SECTOR', 'CITIES', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'CONSERVATISM', 'CORPORATIONS']",['competition'],nonprofits competition

"Although price-matching refund policies are common in many retail environments, the impact of such policies on consumers has largely been ignored. This article reports the results of three studies that examine price-matching policies from a consumer perspective. Study 1 shows that consumers perceive price-matching policies as signals of low store prices and that the presence of a refund increases the likelihood of discontinuing price search. Contrary to the predictions based on signaling theory in information economics, studies 2 and 3 show that when search costs are low, the number of stores searched increases in the presence versus absence of a price-matching policy. When search costs are high, consumers appear to accept the price-matching signal at face value and search less in the presence of a refund. The article concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of the findings and suggesting directions for future research.","['nanPRODUCT QUALITY', 'INFORMATION SEARCH', 'ECONOMICS', 'SIGNALS']","['economics', 'signals']",signaling theory information

"Family businesses (FBs) play a key role in the world's economies. Unfortunately, the current literature surfaces disparate understandings and conclusions concerning their conduct and performance. Much of that literature falls under two insightful perspectives, agency theory and stewardship theory, that conflict quite directly. The agency view, based in economics, maintains that families will pursue utility for themselves to the detriment of their public shareholders. By contrast, stewardship proponents, arguing from a psychological perspective, suggest that family owners will invest deeply in their enterprise, to the benefit of all. This study synthesizes the literature on each of these perspectives to derive core motivational assumptions and expected organizational outcomes. Then, by employing a third sociological perspective, it proposes to reconcile these opposing views by considering the social embeddedness of firms and their key actors within the institution of the family for different types of public family enterprises. It will argue that there is a need for such integration in order to better understand and permit accurate, context-based predictions across various kinds of family businesses and family business situations.","['nanCORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ENTRENCHMENT', 'BUSINESSES']","['performance', 'businesses']",family businesses agency theory
"The objective of this study is to empirically examine whether and how bid pulsing affects keyword auction performance in search engine advertising. In keyword auctions, advertisers can choose a set and forget fixed bidding amount (fixed bidding), or they can change the bid value based on certain types of rules (pulse bidding). A keyword auction data set from Yahoo! reveals that around 60 percent of advertisers frequently changed their bid value for a particular keyword category; moreover, such pulse-bidding behavior is observed throughout the entire time course for some companies. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses on this data set demonstrate that when a company pulses its bid values, the ranking, the number of exposures, and the number of clicks of the target ad listing will all benefit; in addition, the average bid price will be lower. The results are consistent across four keyword categories. Among the three keyword categories that are in ascending order of level of competitiveness,the magnitude of the pulse-bidding effect also increases. The study extends search engine advertising literature by providing empirical evidence of pulse-bidding strategy under the generalized second price auction and by exploring the consequence of such strategy. Managerially, our results suggest that, keeping all other costs and the bidding environment the same, increasing the frequency and scale of bid pulsing will improve keyword performance; this is especially the case when bidding on a highly competitive keyword category.","['Generalized second price auctions', 'keyword bidding', 'keyword search', 'pulse-bidding strategy', 'search engine advertising', 'keyword performanceSPONSORED SEARCH', 'POSITION AUCTIONS', 'MODEL', 'PATTERNS']","['pulse bidding strategy', 'pulse bidding strategy', 'pulse bidding strategy', 'search engine advertising', 'search engine advertising', 'search engine advertising']",bid pulsing keyword auction search engine advertising pulse bidding
"Research summary: I conducted a nationwide replication of Baum and Mezias' (1992) pioneering single-market study of localized competition by pooling the populations of 90 urban U.S. hotel markets. Consistent with Baum and Mezias' three hypotheses, I demonstrate a negative market-level effect on survival duration of size-based, geographic-based, and price-based localized competition. When analyzing submarket windows, I found support for size-based and geographic-based localized competition. In contrast, Baum and Mezias find support for only size-based localized competition at the market level, but for all three forms of localized competition when analyzing submarket windows. I extend their analysis by (1) using standardized measures of localized competition, and (2) showing separate results for key subpopulations. I conclude that there are indeed firm-level benefits of avoiding localized competition. Managerial summary: This paper demonstrates that-at a broad level of analysis such as a city-hotels are more likely to survive if there are fewer other properties (1) in their geographical vicinity, (2) of similar size, and (3) at their price point. Thus, prospective owners should be leery of location in the more crowded niches even if these may be plausibly more lucrative for some. Sparsely populated niches appear to be less risky on average. When we study this phenomenon within a narrower geographic scope such as a part of the city, the least crowded niches in terms of geography, price or size no longer appear to provide benefits in terms of survival. Thus, it is possible that only the most sparsely populated niches citywide improve a hotel's likelihood of survival.

"Purpose The emergence and application of 3D Printing (3DP) is changing the way products are developed and reach the customer, allowing for unprecedented customisation options. Past research has focussed on the modus operandi of the technology, providing indications for wider future adoption. 3DP is predicted to complement current production processes and is anticipated to have a profound effect on the value chain and, therefore, on supply chain (SC) management. Management-related 3DP research has, however, been largely fragmented in terms of analysing the strategic deployment of 3DP and the corresponding effects on performance objectives. The aim of this paper is to identify, define and exemplify typical 3DP deployment strategies pursued. Design/methodology/approach The approach taken is a critical literature review, synthesising and interpreting past research on cross-industry deployment of 3DP, including illustrative examples. This enabled the development of a framework of current stage knowledge. Findings Building on past research, the authors propose a conceptual framework to be used as a classification system for 3DP operations, based on process and SC level configurations across different industries. They discuss the potential impact on operations performance objectives and then highlight research gaps, proposing specific research avenues to enhance understanding of the effects of 3DP adoption on SCs. Practical implications The proposed framework outlines strategic guidelines for 3DP and provides practitioners with the range of strategic options available for 3DP deployment and anticipated impacts on performance. Originality/value The framework can be used to map 3DP deployment at an operational level and identify the likely impact on performance objectives. Relevant implications and a future research agenda are explored.","['Strategy', 'Operations', 'SCM frameworkFUTURE', 'DEPOSITION', 'INNOVATION', 'SERVICE', 'ART']",['operations'],3d printing technology management management performance strategies impact
"Japanese auto makers are reported to enjoy high supplier performance through long-term relationships, specific investments, and sole sourcing. Quality management consultants in the U.S. have been strongly advocating adoption of these practices. But economic and management theorists would predict that the combination of a high level of relationship-specific investments and sole sourcing will lead to problems with supplier performance. In fact the Japanese auto makers use a hybrid form of organization we term parallel sourcing. We present a transaction costs model that shows how parallel sourcing provides incentives for supplier performance associated with multiple sourcing while preserving claimed benefits of sole sourcing.","['SOLE SOURCING', 'COMPETITIVE SOURCING', 'TRANSACTION COSTS', 'SUPPLIER RELATIONSCOSTS']","['sole sourcing', 'sole sourcing', 'transaction costs', 'transaction costs']",long term relationships parallel sourcing transaction costs

In contrast to this dichotomy, ST argues that recognition and formation are recursively implicated because it dissolves the dichotomy between structure and agency, thus showing how entrepreneurial action is both enabled and constrained by the conscious selection, imitation, and modification of business scripts by entrepreneurs. The implications for opportunity research and practice are discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

"We tested the longstanding belief that performance is a function of the interaction between cognitive ability and motivation. Using raw data or values obtained from primary study authors as input (k = 40 to 55; N = 8,507 to 11,283), we used meta-analysis to assess the strength and consistency of the multiplicative effects of ability and motivation on performance. A triangulation of evidence based on several types of analyses revealed that the effects of ability and motivation on performance are additive rather than multiplicative. For example, the additive effects of ability and motivation accounted for about 91% of the explained variance in job performance, whereas the ability-motivation interaction accounted for only about 9% of the explained variance. In addition, when there was an interaction, it did not consistently reflect the predicted form (i.e., a stronger ability-performance relation when motivation is higher). Other key findings include that ability was relatively more important to training performance and to performance on work-related tasks in laboratory studies, whereas ability and motivation were similarly important to job performance. In addition, statelike measures of motivation were better predictors of performance than were traitlike measures. These findings have implications for theories about predictors of performance, state versus trait motivation, and maximal versus typical performance. They also have implications for talent management practices concerned with human capital acquisition and the prediction of employee performance.","['ability', 'motivation', 'performance', 'interactions', 'relative importance', 'meta-analysisJOB-PERFORMANCE', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'MULTIPLE-REGRESSION', 'SELF-EFFICACY', 'MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE', 'WORK PERFORMANCE', 'GOAL ORIENTATION', 'EFFECT SIZE', 'PERSONALITY', 'VALIDATION']","['ability', 'motivation', 'performance']",cognitive ability motivation meta analysis job
"A new trend seems to be emerging for multinational manufacturing companies to make a strategic reorientation into becoming service providers. For some companies, such as Kone and IBM, the revenues from services are 50% or more of their total sales. Despite the increasing interest in exploring various aspects of the service part of the business in manufacturing companies, existing research has not focused on the interdependencies between different service strategies and organizational designs. This article studies different service strategies in manufacturing companies and highlights the organizational design necessary for implementing each service strategy. The service strategies explored are aftersales service providers, customer support service providers, outsourcing partners, and development partners. Each service strategy is supported by organizational design factors related to the service orientation of corporate culture, the service orientation of human resource management, and the service orientation of organizational structures. This research concludes that a specific strategy-structure configuration is needed in order to succeed with a chosen service strategy.","['organizational design factors', 'service strategy', 'service orientation', 'manufacturing companies', 'corporate culture', 'organizational structureDOMINANT LOGIC', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'TRANSITION', 'INDICATORS', 'TAXONOMY', 'PRODUCT', 'MODELS', 'ISSUES', 'GOODS']","['organizational design factors', 'organizational design factors', 'organizational design factors', 'service strategy', 'service strategy', 'service orientation', 'service orientation', 'manufacturing companies', 'manufacturing companies', 'corporate culture', 'corporate culture']",outsourcing
"Competition plays an important role in creating conditions favourable to innovation. However, is this the case for all types of competition? While recognizing the importance of competition in innovation, we address this question by examining the impact of foreign and domestic competition on the innovation performance of private high-tech new ventures. We argue that the impact of foreign and domestic competition on the innovation performance of local private firms may vary, due to the different types of resource interdependence with their competitors and learning gained by private firms. To test these arguments, we conducted a multilevel analysis of 805 Chinese private high-tech firms over the period 2001-2007. Our findings suggest that foreign competition has a U-shaped relationship with the innovation performance of private firms, whereas competition from state-owned enterprises positively affects private firms' innovation performance. Our study moves beyond the debate on whether competition increases or decreases innovation by unpacking the differential effects exerted by different types of competitors on the innovation performance of local private firms in the context of a transition economy.","['resource dependence theory', 'foreign competition', 'SOE competition', 'innovation', 'multilevel analysisRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'PRODUCTIVITY SPILLOVERS', 'TECHNOLOGY SPILLOVERS', 'MANUFACTURING FIRMS', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'LOCAL FIRMS', 'CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION']","['foreign competition', 'foreign competition', 'innovation']",impact performance new ventures

"This paper examines the debate about whether early entrants/pioneers to an industry enjoy long-term advantage over their successors. While most of the research suggests that pioneers are advantaged, there are methodological problems with these studies that tend to enhance the likelihood that pioneers will be found to be more successful. Through a case study of the US animation industry, it is shown that being a late entrant was almost certainly advantageous to some of the companies concerned. The paper explores the reasons why some late entrants prevailed over others and some of the mechanisms that allowed late entrants to overcome pioneers. The factors involved in survival relative to pioneers include the limited protection of patents, complacency, the mobility of staff with expertise in a new technology (in this case cel animation), and the neglected importance of managerial and organizational factors. It is shown that the findings also have implications for the population ecology approach.","['nanMARKET ENTRY', 'GOODS INDUSTRIES', 'ORDER', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ADVANTAGE', 'STRATEGY', 'DISNEY', 'SHARE', 'ISOMORPHISM', 'LIABILITY']",['advantage'],industry ecology
"Using a behavioral approach, this study identifies and delineates components of experiential knowledge in the internationalization process, Three hypotheses are developed and tested, They center around the lack of knowledge in the areas of foreign business, foreign institutions and firm internationalization, as well as the effect that this lack of knowledge has on managers' perceived cost in the internationalization process, With the help of a LISREL-based structural model, the three hypotheses are tested on a sample of 362 service firms, The analysis shows that lack of internationalization knowledge has a strong impact on the lack of both business and institutional knowledge which, in turn, influence the perceived cost of internationalization.

Decisions of low frequency and long duration are not effectively controlled by either monitoring or incentive contracting. For decisions of low frequency and long duration, constraining the firm's choices significantly reduces agency.

"Researchers have examined various techniques to solve the problem of missing data. Simple techniques have included listwise deletion, pairwise deletion, mean substitution, regression imputation and hot-deck imputation. Past research suggests that regression imputation and pairwise deletion generally result in less dispersion around true score values while listwise deletion results in more dispersion around true scores. Unfortunately, this research spent much less lime examining whether the various techniques lead to overestimation or underestimation of the true values of various statistics. The present study utilized a Monte Carlo Analysis to simulate an HRM research setting to evaluate missing data techniques. Pairwise deletion resulted in the least dispersion around true scores and least average error of any missing data technique for calculating correlations.

"Drawing from the attention-based view of the firm, this study adds to research on the entrepreneurial process of early and rapid internationalization by investigating the mediating role of international learning effort in the relationship between international young ventures' entrepreneurial strategic posture and international performance and explores how external and internal factors might moderate this role. Using data from international young ventures based in China, the authors show that an entrepreneurial strategic posture enhances international performance through the intensity of learning efforts expended in foreign markets. Furthermore, the findings reveal that this mediating effect of international learning effort is more pronounced at higher levels of external competitive intensity and intra firm social interaction. This study has great significance for the increasing body of research on international new ventures in that it reveals a critical behavioral mechanism that underpins the learning advantages of these ventures.","['international young ventures', 'attention-based view', 'international learning effort', 'entrepreneurial strategic posture', 'emerging marketsBORN GLOBAL FIRM', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'CAPABILITIES', 'ORIENTATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'EXPANSION', 'VENTURES']","['international young ventures', 'international young ventures', 'international young ventures', 'attention based view', 'attention based view', 'attention based view', 'international learning effort', 'international learning effort', 'international learning effort', 'entrepreneurial strategic posture', 'entrepreneurial strategic posture', 'entrepreneurial strategic posture', 'mediating role', 'mediating role', 'ventures']",international young ventures strategic posture performance
"Despite sizable but varying estimates of multiple jobholding (MJH) and decades of research across disciplines (e.g., management, economics, sociology, health and medicine), our understanding of MJH is rather limited. The purpose of this review is to provide a coherent synthesis of the literature on MJH, or working more than one job. Beginning with a discussion of the motivations and demographic predictors that forecast MJH, we note a distinct divide between the research that predicts MJH and the research that examines outcomes, with few studies exploring how motivations might relate to MJH experiences and outcomes. Another significant observation in this review is the inconsistency of findings across and within disciplines regarding whether MJH is depleting or enriching. Using this framework to organize our review, we attempt to reconcile the generally mixed results by presenting research on mechanisms and boundary conditions of MJH to explain how and when multiple jobholders (MJHers) are depleted or enriched. By integrating findings from the literature, we are able to articulate more clearly the paths of depletion and enrichment and discuss how push versus pull-based motivations to hold multiple jobs likely predict these pathways. Finally, we provide a strategic agenda highlighting areas where additional research is urgently needed to equip scholars with practical knowledge on how to help MJHers manage their multiple work roles and how to help organizations manage MJHers.","['multiple jobholding', 'enrichment versus depletion', 'push versus pullJOB-ATTITUDES', '2ND JOB', 'CREATIVE INDUSTRIES', 'POLICE OFFICERS', 'PART-TIME', 'WORK', 'BEHAVIOR', 'IDENTITIES', 'ENGAGEMENT', 'DYNAMICS']","['multiple jobholding', 'multiple jobholding', 'work']",review motivations
"We present a new perspective on entrepreneurship within multinational corporations (MNCs) based on entrepreneurial contexts and knowledge coordination. First, we develop a framework of four contexts for analyzing different mechanisms by which MNCs pursue opportunities across borders. Second, we develop propositions for predicting how entrepreneurial knowledge is coordinated (transferred and internalized) between these contexts. The coordination problem lies at the heart of the phenomenon of entrepreneurship within modern MNCs although its inter-contextual nature has been neglected in the literature. In our view, MNC entrepreneurship comprises (1) a superset of entrepreneurial activity from four distinct contexts: and (2) the inter-contextual coordination of knowledge of opportunity, knowledge of solution, and learning from outcomes of initiatives. Drawing primarily on the knowledge-based view of the MNC, we argue that knowledge coordination between multiple entrepreneurial contexts constitutes a socially complex capability and potential source of competitive advantage for the MNC. This holistic view of MNC entrepreneurship raises fresh questions for researchers and strategic leaders of MNCs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

"This research revealed the significant role of two distinct cognitive styles as a determinant of perceived entrepreneurial self-efficacy regarding the different stages of the new venture process. The study found that individuals' cognitive preference for analysis or intuition influences their perception and assessment of their entrepreneurial self-efficacy in their intentions to create a new venture. Individuals with the intuitive cognitive style were more confident in their ability to identify and recognize opportunities, without much confidence in their capacity of assessment, evaluation, planning, and marshalling of resources. Conversely, individuals with the analytic cognitive style were more confident in their abilities to assess, evaluate, plan, and marshal resources, but felt less confident in their abilities to search for and recognize new opportunities.","['nanDECISION-MAKING', 'INTENTIONS', 'MANAGERS', 'INDEX', 'ORGANIZATIONS']",['intentions'],
"Close exchange relationships with customers are recognized as important for young firms. In fact, close partnerships with customers provide many advantages, such as innovation, opportunity recognition, reputation, etc. The current paper argues that customers with their close exchange relationships create significant complexities for young firms that require effective structural response. Based on past work on customer driven complexity, four parameters of customer driven complexities were conceptualized: customer variability, customer opportunism, customer-interaction variability, and customer-interaction specificity. Using both archival and survey data from 134 young (6 year old or younger) firms, this study tests the moderating influences of customer driven complexity variables on the relationship between structure and growth of young firms. Findings support the suggestion that more formalization and less delegation of authority at the customer interface significantly contribute to the growth in young firms. However, the positive relationship between formalization and revenue growth is found to be weaker when young firms face a higher level of customer variability and stronger when firms face a higher level of customer opportunism. Similarly, the negative relationship between delegation of authority and revenue growth is weaker when these firms face either a higher level of customer-interaction variability or a higher level of customer-interaction specificity.

"Research summary: The importance of firm-stakeholder relationships is gaining increasing attention. Although a theory of the drivers and consequences of stakeholder pressure has been developing, it focuses on pressures from organized stakeholders such as shareholders, NGOs, and activists, and does not incorporate the emerging possibility that individual voices may matter. By exploring corporate Twitter, which facilitates movement of individual stakeholders such as customers to a higher stakeholder class by providing them with a greater sense of power and urgency, we study the circumstances under which customer voices significantly affect analyst stock recommendations. We find that favorable reactions to firm-initiated messages matter, directly or indirectly, depending on the messages' growth implications. Customer-initiated negative messages have a significant impact only with high volume and formal institutions that support customer opinions.Managerial summary: Social media is increasingly used by firms for disclosing information and engaging stakeholders. Yet, we know little about whether and how social media usage matters. We show how corporate Twitter usage may influence analyst stock recommendations. Our interviews of securities analysts suggest that social media is not institutionalized yet, but increasingly used as a source of channel checks, especially for vibes, validations, and so on. Our analyses of corporate Twitter accounts show that both firm-initiated and customer-initiated tweets can have significant impact on analyst recommendations under certain conditions. For firm-initiated tweets, the extent of retweets is an important factor, along with the content of tweets, in particular, growth implications. For customer-initiated tweets, negative tweets matter, but only with high volume and regulatory structure that supports customer protection.

"Drawing upon the Job Demand-Control (JDC) model, this study investigates differences in work-related stress between the self-employed and wage workers. The JDC model postulates that job demand increases work-related stress, whereas job control reduces it (also by weakening the effect of job demand on work-related stress). Based on this model, we predict that the self-employed experience less work-related stress than wage workers. Empirical analysis of a longitudinal sample from Australia (2005-2013) confirms our expectations and demonstrates that job control fully mediates the negative relationship between self-employment and work related stress. Further analyses show that self-employed individuals with employees experience more work-related stress than those without employees because of higher job demand.(C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"The ability of an organization to apply knowledge globally has been conceptualized as critical for the existence of multinational corporations (MNCs). We argue for an organizational separation effect on knowledge sharing that challenges the view of the MNC as a latent social community. Using a unique data-set of more than 4000 individual responses from an MNC, Telenor, we test how three types of drivers for individuals' knowledge sharing-individuals' motivation, and individuals' perceptions of organizational values and organizational work practices-work differently within, as opposed to across, business units. Our analysis suggests that while intrinsic motivation, innovative values and job autonomy are relatively important drivers of knowledge sharing within the business units, extrinsic motivation, result-oriented values and participation in corporate employee development are relatively more important for knowledge sharing across business units.

"The authors study consumer perceptions of firms that sell products designed by users. In contrast with the traditional design mode, in which professional designers employed by firms handle the design task, common design by users involves the firm's user community in creating new product designs for the broader consumer market. In the course of four studies, the authors find that common design by users does not decrease but actually enhances consumers' perceptions of a firm's innovation ability. This innovation effect of user design leads to positive outcomes with respect to purchase intentions, willingness to pay, and consumers' willingness to recommend the firm to others. The authors identify four defining characteristics of common design by users that underlie this innovation inference; namely, the number of consumers, the diversity of their background, the lack of company constraints, and the fact that consumer designers actually use the designed product all contribute in building positive perceptions. Finally, the authors identify consumer familiarity with user innovation and the design task's complexity as important moderators that create boundary conditions for the innovation effect of user design.","['product design', 'co-creation', 'user design', 'user innovation', 'innovationLEAD USERS', 'INFORMATION', 'COMPLEXITY', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'GENERATION', 'PROJECTION', 'INSIGHTS', 'MODELS', 'IMPACT', 'IDEAS']","['product design', 'product design', 'user design', 'user design', 'user innovation', 'user innovation', 'complexity']",perceptions design innovation diversity

First, experience is more engaging than most attempts at education, both more vivid and intentional, and consequently more memorable. Second, experience is viewed as nonpartisan, devoid of the didacticism of formal education and the self-serving interests of advertisers. Third, much of experience is ambiguous, but not recognized as such. Experience supports a pseudodiagnosticity that draws the consumer in as a willing partner in the seduction.

Using intermediation theory to ground our study, we collected qualitative data on 29 social intermediation projects located within Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Our findings suggest that socializing intermediation theory to more accurately explain and predict structural outcomes across more diverse contexts requires three key modifications: (1) the attenuation of opportunism, which creates an internalizing social force; (2) the accommodation of non-monetary objectives, which creates an externalizing social force; and (3) the perception of transaction capabilities as tractable, which serves as a guidepost for reconciling these two opposing social forces.","['base-of-the-pyramid', 'intermediation', 'poverty alleviation', 'social enterprise', 'structuringQUALITATIVE RESEARCH', 'INCLUSIVE GROWTH', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'FIRM', 'MANAGEMENT', 'RESPONSIBILITY', 'GOVERNANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'ALTRUISM']","['base of the pyramid', 'base of the pyramid', 'base of the pyramid', 'base of the pyramid', 'intermediation']",base of the pyramid
"This study examines how the quality of individuals' social exchange relationships with their leaders and separately, their work unit peers, mediate the interactive effects of abusive supervision directed toward themselves (own abusive supervision) and toward their work unit peers (peer abusive supervision) on individual task performance and helping behavior directed toward coworkers. Testing the model using a sample of 358 workers from 25 organizations, we found support for our hypotheses that leader member exchange (LMX) and affect-based trust in peers each partially mediated the interactive effects of own and peer abusive supervision. Workers that exhibited high levels of task performance and engaged in more helping behaviors tended to have both low own abusive supervision and low peer abusive supervision. Own abusive supervision was unrelated to the behavioral outcomes among workers whose peers were victims of supervisory abuse. We discuss the implications of relational dynamics with peers and the immediate supervisor for understanding the scope of the impact of abusive supervision on follower outcomes.","['nanLEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'JUSTICE', 'TRUST', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'MODEL', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'INJUSTICE', 'CONSTRUCT', 'FAIRNESS']","['trust', 'model']",trust

"The purpose of this study is to identify groups of firms with similar generic knowledge strategies, determine how these strategies change over time, and compare profit margins of the groups. Knowledge strategies of 21 U.S. pharmaceutical firms are analyzed from 1977 to 1991. Cluster analysis is used to group firms over different time periods based on: (a) balance between internal and external learning, (b) preference for radical or incremental learning, (c) learning speed, and (d) breadth of knowledge base. Our findings indicate that there are four generic knowledge strategy groups: 'Explorers', 'Exploiters', 'Loners', and 'Innovators'. Most firms remain in the same knowledge group over time. The firms in the 'Innovator' and 'Explorer' groups tend to be more profitable than the firms in the 'Exploiter' and 'Loner' groups.","['organizational learning', 'knowledge strategies', 'strategic management', 'technology management', 'pharmaceutical industryPERFORMANCE', 'BARRIERS', 'MODEL', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'COMPETITION', 'INNOVATION']","['knowledge strategies', 'knowledge strategies']",analysis

"This study examines relationships among high-performance work systems (HPWS), job control, employee anxiety, role overload, and turnover intentions. Building on theory that challenges the rhetoric versus reality of HPWS, the authors explore a potential dark side of HPWS that suggests that HPWS, which are aimed at creating a competitive advantage for organizations, do so at the expense of workers, thus resulting in negative consequences for individual employees. However, the authors argue that these consequences may be tempered when HPWS are also implemented with a sufficient amount of job control, or discretion given to employees in determining how to implement job responsibilities. The authors draw on job demands-control theory and the stress literatures to hypothesize moderated-mediation relationships relating the interaction of HPWS utilization and job control to anxiety and role overload, with subsequent effects on turnover intentions. The authors examine these relationships in a multilevel sample of 1,592 government workers nested in 87 departments from the country of Wales. Results support their hypotheses, which highlight several negative consequences when HPWS are implemented with low levels of job control. They discuss their findings in light of the critique in the literature toward the utilization of HPWS in organizations and offer suggestions for future research directions.","['high-performance work systems', 'job control', 'anxiety', 'role overload', 'turnover intentionsHUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'EXCHANGE RELATIONSHIPS', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'HR PRACTICES', 'QUIT RATES', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'OUTCOMES', 'IMPACT', 'EMPLOYEES']","['high performance work systems', 'high performance work systems', 'high performance work systems', 'high performance work systems', 'job control', 'job control', 'anxiety', 'role overload', 'role overload', 'employees']",high performance work systems control turnover intentions demands
"Purpose This paper aims to identify and systematically analyze the causal-effect relationships among barriers to circular food supply chains in China. Design/methodology/approach Grounded in multiple organizational theories, this paper develops a theoretical framework for identifying relevant barriers to integrating circular economy philosophy in food supply chain management. The study uses 105 responses from Chinese food supply chain stakeholders including food processors, sales and distribution channels, consumers and government officials. It applies a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to examine the causal-effect relationships among the identified barriers. Findings Overall, the results suggest two key cause barriers: first, weak environmental regulations and enforcement, and second, lack of market preference/pressure. Meanwhile, lack of collaboration/support from supply chain actors is the most prominent barrier. The key cause and prominent barriers are also identified for each of the supply chain stakeholder involved. Research implications - The study offers practical insights for overcoming barriers to integrating circular economy philosophy in the management of supply chains in the Chinese food sector, as well as in other contexts where similar challenges are faced. It also sheds light on which organizational theories are most suitable for guiding similar studies. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first barrier study on circular food supply chains. The use of multiple organizational theories for the development of the theoretical framework is unique in barrier studies. The study offers insights from multiple stakeholders in the Chinese food supply chains.","['China', 'Sustainability', 'Sustainable supply chain', 'Circular supply chain', 'Food industry', 'Circular economy', 'Barrier', 'Fuzzy DEMATELECO-INDUSTRIAL PARK', 'FUZZY-DEMATEL', 'CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ECONOMY', 'GREEN', 'WASTE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL', 'LOOP']","['china', 'circular economy', 'circular economy', 'barrier', 'management', 'economy']",barriers to circular food china circular economy supply chain management
"Research and practice have called for the incorporation of customer mindset metrics (CMMs) to improve the accuracy of models that predict individual customer profits. However, as CMMs are self-reported data, collected through customer surveys, they are seldom available for a firm's entire customer database and in addition always measured with some degree of error. Their usage in models for individual-level predictions of customer profit has therefore proven challenging. We offer a solution through a new method called multiple overimputation (MO). MO treats missing data as an extreme form of measurement error and imputes the CMMs for both customers with observed, albeit with measurement error, as well as missing values, that are then included as predictors in a model of individual customer profits. Through a simulation study, empirical application in the pharmaceutical industry, and a customer selection exercise, we demonstrate the predictive and economic value of applying MO in the context of CRM.","['Customer profit prediction', 'Multiple overimputation', 'Imputation', 'Mindset metrics', 'Zero inflated poisson modelsDYNAMIC-MODEL', 'DATA FUSION', 'LIFETIME VALUE', 'SATISFACTION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'BEHAVIOR', 'IMPACT', 'PHYSICIANS', 'SHARE', 'CLV']","['multiple overimputation', 'multiple overimputation', 'imputation', 'mindset metrics', 'mindset metrics']",customer mindset metrics multiple overimputation crm
"This study examines the role of social support in work-family conflict. Although previous research has examined social support as a promising coping mechanism, questions as to how social support affects work-family conflict remain unanswered Social support is examined as an antecedent, an intervening, a moderating, and an independent variable in the stressors to work-family conflict relationship. Results suggest that social support may De best viewed as an antecedent to perceived stressors. From this, a more full model of work-family conflict is developed and tested. Discussion centers around how social support reduces the likelihood that situations will be perceived as stressful, thus, indirectly affecting work-family, conflict through perceived stressors.

"This paper examines the impact of market liberalization on firm performance through institutional changes during the economic reform in China. The conceptualization focuses on the decentralization of control, ownership restructuring, and industrial policy as the primary institutional changes to implement market liberalization in China. These institutional changes affect firm performance by shaping managerial incentives, affecting transaction and agency costs, and making selective resource allocations across and within industries. Using a large-scale data set including 23,577 firms between 1992 and 1996, the study examines how market liberalization affects the profitability and productivity of Chinese firms and the relationship between ownership change and the performance of state-owned enterprises.","['market liberalization', 'economic transition', 'firm performanceORGANIZATIONAL DYNAMICS', 'FISCAL REFORM', 'PRIVATIZATION', 'INDUSTRY', 'CAPITALISM', 'STRATEGY', 'GUANXI', 'ORDER']","['market liberalization', 'market liberalization']",firm performance institutional changes china

We consider the effects of inheritance law provisions on property transfers and the potential impact on family firm vitality in four jurisdictions: Germany, France, Hong Kong SAR, and the United States. These jurisdictions have divergent legal origins and inheritance law regimes that generate distinct patterns of transformation and continuity in family firms.

"Employing elements of organizational theory and service recovery research, the authors examine how employees' perceptions of shared values and organizational justice can stimulate customer-directed extra-role behaviors when handling complaints. They also investigate how these extra-role behaviors affect customers' perceptions of justice, satisfaction, word of mouth, and purchase intent. The authors capture and match employee and customer perceptions regarding the relevant constructs following a complaint and recovery experience. The results indicate that employees' perceptions of shared values and organizational justice affect customer-directed extra-role behaviors. Furthermore, the authors find that extra-role behaviors have significant effects on customers' perceptions of justice and that these behaviors mediate the effects of shared values and organizational justice on customer justice perceptions. Their study reveals that customer ratings of justice affect the customer outcomes of satisfaction with recovery, overall firm satisfaction, purchase intent, and word of mouth. Finally, the authors show that customers' perceptions of justice mediate the effects that extra-role behaviors have on customer outcomes.","['nanCITIZENSHIP BEHAVIORS', 'INTERACTIONAL JUSTICE', 'FAIRNESS PERCEPTIONS', 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE', 'FUTURE-RESEARCH', 'SATISFACTION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EMPLOYEES', 'SUGGESTIONS', 'PREDICTORS']","['satisfaction', 'employees']",service recovery extra role behaviors
"Most studies of technologies' impact on occupational change focus on occupational groups' adoption and use of particular technologies in a field or workplace. Drawing on an 18-month ethnographic study of a crime laboratory, I focus instead on evaluative spillovers: the comparisons that occupations encounter when technologies change the work of neighboring occupations in their field. I explore what happened when DNA profiling was held up as the gold standard of forensic evidence, resulting in scientific, public, and legal scrutiny of other forensic science occupational groups. Comparisons with DNA profiling challenged the working techniques and the values of firearms examiners, toxicologists, and narcotics analysts, but each group responded differently, either embracing or resisting changes to their work practices. Their responses were predicated on the institutional pathways that evaluative spillovers traveled through the field in locales such as professional association meetings and court proceedings. These three aspects of the occupational system-technique, values, and institutional pathways-influenced how workers negotiated the impact of technological change in the field of forensic science.","['work', 'technology', 'occupations', 'legitimacy', 'occupational changeINHABITED INSTITUTIONS', 'WORKPLACE', 'WORK', 'RETHINKING', 'SOCIOLOGY', 'IDENTITY', 'HISTORY', 'ORDER', 'JOBS']","['work', 'occupations', 'workplace', 'work']",evaluative spillovers
"Recent research notes a disconnect between what marketers deem new and innovative versus what consumers actually perceive. Many factors may contribute to this; however, the factor that has significant potential to first attract a consumer to a new product, visual aesthetic design, is investigated in this research. Findings from four studies indicate that if a consumer cannot affix a category label to a new product with certainty, as can happen with innovative aesthetics, a product's newness will be underappreciated and product evaluations will suffer. By utilizing a categorization framework and specifically accounting for the role of categorization certainty, insight into the effects of innovative visual aesthetics and why newness perceptions are inherently subjective, and therefore, potentially hazardous to new product adoption, is provided.","['nanPRODUCT INNOVATIVENESS', 'ADOPTION', 'VALIDATION', 'CONFIDENCE', 'INFERENCE', 'RESPONSES', 'DESIGN', 'IMPACT', 'ROLES', 'TIME']","['adoption', 'design']",consumers design
"Third-party accreditations and certifications can provide legitimacy or signal trustworthiness about an organization and its products or services, and with very little exception, the vast majority of research on these labels focuses on their benefits. Yet the value of becoming accredited may change dramatically over time. Little research, if any, has examined the processes through which this occurs. Here, I develop theory about three mechanisms that could each tarnish the value of accreditation and reduce its performance impact. First, quality patching occurs when organizations are penalized if they seek accreditation shortly after problems occur, as observers believe such pursuits reflect superficial impression-management efforts. Second, legitimacy dilution occurs when the value of third-party accreditations becomes diluted as third parties certify more and more businesses. Finally, stigma transfer occurs when a newly accredited organization experiences spillover from quality problems at other accredited organizations. Empirical tests provide support for quality patching and legitimacy dilution but not for stigma transfer. Results suggest that organizations gaining new accreditations under some circumstances may benefit much less than organizations that gain those same accreditations under different circumstances.","['accreditation', 'certification', 'legitimacy', 'stigma', 'reputation', 'impression management', 'crisis management', 'quality', 'health care', 'home healthMANAGEMENT STANDARD', 'AUTOMOBILE-INDUSTRY', 'OPERATIVE MORTALITY', 'FORMAL-STRUCTURE', 'SURGEON VOLUME', 'UNITED-STATES', 'REPUTATION', 'LEGITIMACY', 'SPREAD', 'CONSEQUENCES']","['accreditation', 'certification', 'legitimacy', 'stigma', 'impression management', 'impression management', 'quality', 'legitimacy']",accreditations legitimacy trustworthiness performance quality patching management transfer
"This paper integrates content-based predictions of transaction. cost economics with process-based predictions of organizational change to understand adaptation to deregulation in the for-hire trucking industry. We predict find that firms whose governance of a core transaction is poor (according to transaction cost reasoning) will realize lower profits than their better-aligned counterparts and that these firms will attempt to adapt so as to better align their transactions. Results show that several organizational features affect the rate of adaptation: (1) firms with large investments in specialized assets adapt less readily than firms that rely on generic assets, (2) firms with unions adapt less readily than firms without unions, (3) firms that must replace employee drivers with owner-operators adapt less readily than firms that must replace owner-operators with employee drivers, and (4) entrants adapt more quickly than incumbent carriers. There is evidence of institutional isomorphism in that although carriers move systematically to reduce misalignment, they do so less assiduously when this will make their governance of drivers look less like that of nearby, similar carriers. Finally, our results indicate that firms that ultimately exited adapted more quickly than firms that survived.(.)","['nanORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'TRANSACTION COST', 'TRUCKING INDUSTRY', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'ASSET OWNERSHIP', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'INFORMATION', 'CONTRACTS', 'IMITATION', 'ECONOMICS']","['transaction cost', 'transaction cost', 'trucking industry', 'trucking industry', 'economics']",adaptation industry

"This research applies an institutional arrangement perspective to develop an end-to-end model for the interaction between customers and upstream suppliers to develop a new product to understand how new product value is created and shared. The model is empirically tested by collecting primary data from 188 manufacturers across different industries. The research demonstrates that customer participation affects new product value creation by improving the effectiveness of the new product development process by enhancing information sharing and customer-supplier coordination and by increasing the level of customer and supplier specific investments in the product development effort. In addition, increasing the formalization of the customer participation process enhances both customer and supplier relationship-specific investments in the new product development process. The impact of customer participation on the customer's share of the new product value pie is more complex then is first apparent. Based on the dependence and equity perspectives the results suggest that exchange partners' power (relative dependence) positively influences a partner's ability to capture new product value, but this power is offset by a desire of exchange partners to ensure the distribution of value is fair and reflects each party's contribution to the value creation.","['new product development', 'dependence', 'equity', 'customer participation', 'relationship marketing', 'institutional arrangement', 'innovationDETERMINANTS', 'MODEL', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'GOVERNANCE', 'VIEW', 'PIE', 'COORDINATION', 'ORIENTATION', 'FAIRNESS', 'STRATEGY']","['new product development', 'new product development', 'new product development', 'dependence', 'equity', 'customer participation', 'customer participation', 'institutional arrangement', 'institutional arrangement', 'model', 'pie', 'coordination']",customer participation supplier coordination

This three-process model sets boundary conditions for the existing source models (i.e., main-effect models and source-by-product interaction models) and explains negative source effects.","['nanFLEXIBLE CORRECTION PROCESSES', 'SOURCE CREDIBILITY', 'CELEBRITY ENDORSER', 'SOCIAL JUDGMENT', 'NAIVE THEORIES', 'BIAS', 'ATTRACTIVENESS', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'INFORMATION', 'IMPRESSION']",['bias'],
"Multilevel modeling allows researchers to understand whether relationships between lower-level variables (e.g., individual job satisfaction and individual performance, firm capabilities and performance) change as a function of higher-order moderator variables (e.g., leadership climate, market-based conditions). We describe how to estimate such cross-level interaction effects and distill the technical literature for a general readership of management researchers, including a description of the multilevel model building process and an illustration of analyses and results with a data set grounded in substantive theory. In addition, we provide 10 specific best-practice recommendations regarding persistent and important challenges that researchers face before and after data collection to improve the accuracy of substantive conclusions involving cross-level interaction effects. Our recommendations provide guidance on how to define the cross-level interaction effect, compute statistical power and make research design decisions, test hypotheses with various types of moderator variables (e.g., continuous, categorical), rescale (i.e., center) predictors, graph the cross-level interaction effect, interpret interactions given the symmetrical nature of such effects, test multiple cross-level interaction hypotheses, test cross-level interactions involving more than two levels of nesting, compute effect-size estimates and interpret the practical importance of a cross-level interaction effect, and report results regarding the multilevel model building process.","['multilevel modeling', 'moderation', 'cross-level', 'interactionLINEAR MIXED MODELS', 'CENTERING PREDICTOR VARIABLES', 'RANDOMIZED-TRIALS', 'POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION', 'MULTIPLE-REGRESSION', 'MANAGEMENT RESEARCH', 'STATISTICAL POWER', 'OPTIMAL-DESIGN', 'VARIANCE', 'SIZE']","['multilevel modeling', 'multilevel modeling', 'cross level', 'cross level', 'management research', 'management research', 'statistical power', 'statistical power', 'size']",multilevel modeling climate
"Purpose This paper aims to propose an empirically grounded governance framework based on complex adaptive systems (CAS) principles to facilitate formation of well-connected regional supply chains that foster economic development, adaptability and resilience of mining regions. Design/methodology/approach This study is an exploratory case study of the South Australian (SA) mining industry that includes 38 semi-structured interviews with the key stakeholders and structural analysis of the regional supply network (RSN). Findings Findings demonstrate the applicability of the CAS framework as a structured approach to the governance of the mining industry regional supply chains. In particular, the findings exemplify the relationship between RSN governance, its structure and interconnectivity and their combined impact on the adaptability and resilience of mining regions. Research limitations/implications The data set analysed in the current study is static. Longitudinal data would permit a deeper insight into the evolution of the RSN structure and connectivity. The validity of the proposed framework could be further strengthened by being applied to other industrial domains and geographical contexts. Practical/implications The proposed framework offers a novel insight for regional policy-makers striving to create an environment that facilitates the formation of well-integrated regional supply chains in mining regions through more focussed policy and strategies. Originality/value The proposed framework is one of the first attempts to offer a holistic structured approach to governance of the regional supply chains based on CAS principles. With the current transformative changes in the global mining industry, policy-makers and supply chain practitioners have an urgent need to embrace CAS and network paradigms to remain competitive in the twenty-first century.","['Australia', 'Supply chain management', 'Governance', 'Complex adaptive systems', 'Case studies', 'Network organization', 'Regional supply network', 'Mining regionsSTRUCTURAL EMBEDDEDNESS', 'INTERFIRM NETWORKS', 'MINING EQUIPMENT', 'DYNAMICS', 'CLUSTERS', 'LINKAGES', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'EVOLUTION', 'INDUSTRY', 'COLLABORATION']","['australia', 'governance', 'complex adaptive systems', 'complex adaptive systems', 'complex adaptive systems', 'regional supply network', 'regional supply network', 'regional supply network', 'evolution', 'industry']",complex adaptive systems south australian

An important, but largely unexplored, issue is how this information is processed and used in conjunction with prior beliefs to influence price perceptions. In our initial studies we manipulated prior beliefs and two data-based cues-frequency of price advantage and magnitude of price advantage-to determine their relative influence on consumer price perceptions. Results indicate that prior beliefs affected price perceptions but that the frequency cue exerted a dominating influence.

"This paper examines the determinants of a multinational enterprise's (MNEs) decision to set up tax haven subsidiaries. We adapt the firm-specific advantage-country-specific advantage (FSA-CSA) framework and construct a number of empirically testable hypotheses. The analysis is based on a database covering 14,209 MNEs in twelve OECD countries. We find that the variety of capitalism of a MNEs home location and the level of technological intensity has a strong impact on this decision. We also find that the home country corporate tax rate has a minimal impact. This suggests that corporate tax liberalisation is unlikely to deter MNEs from undertaking this activity.

"Research Summary This paper seeks to extend the problemistic search literature by investigating how far entrepreneurial organizations seeking to improve their chances for success should search, depending on their level of past performance. Drawing on a novel data set from the Google Play app store, the paper finds support for its hypothesis that past performance moderates the relationship between search distance and subsequent performance. As past performance increases, the less beneficial (and potentially more harmful) nonlocal search becomes. While the majority of app developers choose a nonlocal search strategy in response to low first app performance, this is rarely the best choice. Instead, the highest second app performance outcomes are associated with moderate search distances that fall between local and nonlocal extremes. Managerial Summary This paper uses a large data set obtained from the Google Play app store to explore the following question: when a nascent app developer's first app performs poorly, how different should its second app be? By comparing the text descriptions of developers' first and second apps, the paper is able to show that as the performance of a first app increases, the more harmful it becomes to make a very different second app. Only at extremely low levels of first app performance is it beneficial for developers to make second apps that are very different from their first apps. In all other cases, making second apps that are moderately different-rather than very similar or very different-is associated with the highest second app performance.","['entrepreneurship', 'organizational learning', 'pivot', 'problemistic search', 'rugged landscapesBEHAVIORAL-THEORY', 'EXPLORATION', 'PERSISTENCE', 'FAILURES', 'CREATION', 'MODEL']","['problemistic search', 'problemistic search']",search distance

The framing literature suggests discounts have robust positive effects on consumer perceptions of deal value. However, the current research showed that negative quality inferences moderated discount framing effects and undermined deal value, particularly when no assurance of product quality was provided. Every-day-low-price offers were also vulnerable to negative quality inferences, while free gift frames maintained quality perceptions and increased deal value. Product trial acted to further magnify promotional framing effects, according to a confirmation bias. These findings were consistent with an attribute framing mechanism.

"While overseas acquisitions by emerging-economy firms are gaining increased attention from the business press, our understanding of whether and why this inorganic mode of international expansion creates value to acquirer firms is limited. We argue that international acquisitions facilitate internalization of tangible and intangible resources that are both difficult to trade through market transactions and take time to develop internally, thus constituting an important strategic lever of value creation for emerging-economy firms. Furthermore, the magnitude of value created will be higher when the target firms are located in advanced economic and institutional environments: country markets that carry the promise of higher quality of resources, and therefore, stronger complementarity to the existing capabilities of emerging-economy firms. An event study of 425 cross-border acquisitions by Indian firms during 2000-2007 supports our predictions.

Such ties offer the start-up increased legitimacy and a relational safeguard against resource misappropriation by more powerful partners. However, we propose that there is a limit to the effectiveness of relational pluralism. Its effect is weakened when the start-up becomes entirely dependent on a small set of partners, or when an additional tie yields resources that are redundant. We argue that the start-up only benefits when the gains from relational safeguarding and legitimacy outweigh the costs of dependence and redundancy. We empirically observe the co-evolution of start-ups' interlocking directorate and strategic alliance networks in the Australian mining industry over a 10-year period. Our results show that start-ups that engage in relational pluralism perform better than both start-ups that form no alliances and start-ups that form stand-alone alliances. Having a very small portfolio of partners or one that skews heavily toward local partners, however, indeed limits the effectiveness of relational pluralism. Intriguingly, we also find that the temporal sequencing of relational pluralism matters. One of our central findings is that the best performing start-ups first form board interlocks with promising partners and add a strategic alliance later. This offers a rare glance at the temporal sequencing in which peripheral start-ups can gain exceptional performance through partnership formation.","['nanINTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION', 'ALLIANCE PORTFOLIOS', 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'NETWORK', 'FIRM', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'GOVERNANCE', 'EVOLUTION', 'RESOURCE']","['network', 'performance', 'evolution', 'resource']",legitimacy powerful networks
"We explore how firms protect themselves from the risks of knowledge spillover to indirectly connected rivals in a network of interorganizational ties. We argue that the safeguards to limit opportunistic behavior by directly linked firms in a dyad, which have been the focus of extant research, are insufficient to overcome extra-dyadic leakage risks. Instead, firms terminate or avoid ties that expose their knowledge to indirectly linked rivals (pruning and grafting) and embed themselves in dense networks (closing) to prevent strategic knowledge spillover. Through a longitudinal study of German board interlocks during 1990-2003, we find that firms are more likely to prune, graft, and close their networks as they accumulate strategic knowledge and as the firms to which they are interlocked increasingly generate indirect ties to competitors, even when controlling for dyadic safeguards discussed by prior research. We capture strategic knowledge by tracking firms' experience in the former Warsaw Pact countries from immediately after the sudden fall of communism in 1990 until 2003. The study introduces indirect links to rivals as a source of knowledge spillover in networks, shows how firms deal with extra-dyadic risks, and provides a defensive explanation for the evolution of network composition and structure.","['nanSHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'SOCIAL-STRUCTURE', 'CORPORATE ELITE', 'PANEL-DATA', 'GOVERNANCE', 'DYNAMICS', 'EMBEDDEDNESS', 'CAPABILITIES', 'COMPETITION', 'FIRM']",['firm'],
"Two distinct themes emerge from the Special Research Forum on Innovation and Organizations. One group of articles develops an expanded view of the influence of context on organizations' ability to innovate. Together, the articles offer a complex multilevel view of context as including elements ranging from the dominant strategy of an organization to the social-psychological antecedents of creativity. A second group of articles provides a community and population perspective on the diffusion of innovations. We suggest the possibility of a union between the context and industry dynamics approaches.","['nanFORMAL-STRUCTURE', 'DIFFUSION']",['diffusion'],
"Research summary: The dominant view has been that businesses that are more related to each other are more often combined within diversified firms. This study uses a dynamic model to demonstrate that, with inter-temporal economies of scope, diversified firms are more likely to combine moderately related businesses than the most-related businesses. That effect occurs because strong relatedness reduces redeployment costs and makes firms redeploy all resources to better performing businesses. The strength of that effect depends on inducements for redeployment measured as the current return advantage of one business over another business, volatilities of business returns, and correlation of those returns. This study develops hypotheses for those relationships and suggests empirical operationalizations, encouraging empiricists to retest the implications of relatedness for the dynamics of corporate diversification. Managerial summary: It is believed that diversified firms are more likely to combine more-related businesses because relatedness enables sharing of resources between businesses. Indeed, a firm can apply knowledge created in one business to another business, avoiding costly duplication in knowledge development. Resource sharing also adds value when a firm offers several products, adding the convenience of one-stop shopping and charging higher prices. However, resource sharing is not the only motivation for corporate diversification. In environments where profitability of businesses changes frequently, firms diversify by redeploying part of resources from an underperforming business to a better performing business. This study uses a dynamic model to demonstrate that, with that second motivation for corporate diversification, firms end up combining moderately related businesses rather than the most-related businesses.

"Although brand theorists suggest that what a person knows about a company (i.e., corporate associations) can influence perceptions of the company's products, little systematic research on these effects exists. The authors examine the effects of two general types of corporate associations on product responses: One focuses on the company's capabilities for producing products, that is, corporate ability (CA) associations, and the other focuses on the company's perceived social responsibility, that is, corporate social responsibility (CSR) associations. The results of three studies, including one that measures respondents' CA and CSR associations for well-known companies and one that uses consumers recruited in a shopping mall, demonstrate that (1) what consumers know about a company can influence their beliefs about and attitudes toward new products manufactured by that company, (2) CA and CSR associations may have different effects on consumer responses to products, and (3) products of companies with negative associations are not always destined to receive negative responses. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for marketing managers and further research.","['nanCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'REPUTATION', 'CONTRAST', 'ASSIMILATION', 'INFORMATION', 'IMAGE', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'INFERENCES', 'ATTRIBUTES']",['perceptions'],ability social
"Purpose - The performance of service supply chains in terms of service levels and cost efficiency depends not only on the effort of service providers but also on the inputs of sub-contractors and the customer. In this sense, performance-based contracting (PBC) entails increased financial risk for providers. Allocating and managing risk through contractual relationships along the service supply chain is a critical issue, and yet there is scant empirical evidence regarding what factors influence, and how, provider willingness to bear PBC-induced risk. This paper aims to address this gap. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on agency theory and two cases of logistics service supply chains, in the food retail and automotive industries respectively, to identify key influencing factors. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 30 managers of providers and sub-contractors and review of 35 documents, notably contracts and target letters. Findings - Four influencing factors were found: performance attributability within the service supply chain; relational governance in service supply chain relationships; provider risk and reward balancing; and provider ability to transfer risk to sub-contractors. The propositions developed address how these factors influence provider willingness to bear PBC-induced risk. Research limitations/implications The factors identified are external to the provider mindset and refer to the management of contractual relationships and service delivery interactions along the service supply chain. The paper contributes to agency theory by stressing the risk allocation implications of bi-directional principal-agent relations in service supply chains. Practical implications - The study suggests ways in which providers can increase their capacity to bear and manage financial risk related to PBC design. Originality/value - The paper identifies factors that influence provider willingness to bear financial risk induced by PBC in service supply chains.","['Supply chain management', 'Agency theory', 'Risk management', 'Service industries', 'Performance-based contracting', 'Service supply chains', 'Transport and distributionOPERATIONS STRATEGY', 'CUSTOMER SOLUTIONS', 'DEFENSE INDUSTRY', 'AGENCY THEORY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'INFORMATION', 'ISSUES', 'INCENTIVES', 'FRAMEWORK', 'BEHAVIOR']","['agency theory', 'agency theory', 'performance based contracting', 'performance based contracting', 'performance based contracting', 'service supply chains', 'service supply chains', 'service supply chains', 'agency theory', 'agency theory', 'management']",performance based contracting risk risk agency theory logistics relational governance
"Traditionally, the value of a product has been assessed according to the direct revenues the product creates. However, products do not exist in isolation but rather influence one another's sales. Such influence is especially evident in e-commerce environments, in which products are often presented as a collection of web pages linked by recommendation hyperlinks, creating a large-scale product network. The authors present a systematic approach to estimate products' true value to a firm in such a product network. Their approach, which is in the spirit of the Page Rank algorithm, uses available data from large-scale e-commerce sites and separates a product's value into its own intrinsic value, the value it receives from the network, and the value it contributes to the network. The authors demonstrate their approach using data collected from the product network of books on Amazon.com. Specifically, they show that the value of low sellers may be underestimated, whereas the value of best sellers may be overestimated. The authors explore the sources of this discrepancy and discuss the implications for managing products in the growing environment of product networks.","['product value', 'cross-selling', 'electronic commerce', 'recommendation systems', 'social networksRECOMMENDATION NETWORKS', 'LONG TAIL', 'SALES', 'SYSTEMS', 'DEMAND', 'IMPACT']",['sales'],e commerce environments
"International exchange is a two-sided coin, involving exporters and importers. However, a systematic search of the academic literature reveals a striking imbalance: while exporter behavior has been extensively studied, importer behavior remains a largely neglected area of study, even though importers are playing an ever more important (often dominant) role in consummating trade transactions. In this article, we assert that this neglect stems from two critical - but flawed - assumptions. The first is that exporters are the driving force behind international trade transactions, and tbe second is that importers follow the neoclassical economics theory of ''rational choice'' in international sourcing. We offer an integrated exporter/importer decision framework, a critical review and synthesis of extant studies of importer behavior, and suggestions for future research directions. Evidence shows that much international exchange is better conceptualized as buyer-coordinated importing rather than producer-initiated exporting. Furthermore, the revealed behavior of importers is different from what can be expected of them from the rational choice paradigm, and is messier than what is commonly assumed of them in the export management literature. From a cognitive perspective, our study also suggests that there may exist a fundamental behavioral difference between domestic and IB decisionmaking.","['nanUNITED-STATES', 'INDUSTRIAL-PRODUCTS', 'PURCHASING MANAGERS', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INFORMATION', 'STRATEGY', 'SUPPLIER', 'CHOICE', 'DETERMINANTS']",['choice'],international exchange decisionmaking
"Comprehensiveness has long been recognized as a key feature of marketing strategy decision making. However, few studies have examined its antecedents and the conditions under which it influences performance. This study attempts to contribute to a better understanding of marketing strategy by investigating project-level antecedents and outcomes of marketing strategy comprehensiveness (MSC). Drawing on contingency and institutional theories perspectives, the authors develop and test the effects of output and process rewards, task conflict, and project members' intra- and extraindustry relationships on MSC. They find that whereas process reward and extraindustry relationships are positively related to MSC, task conflict (when combined with conflict avoidance) hinders its development. Furthermore, the results indicate that MSC has a more positive effect on performance when implementation speed is higher. Finally, the authors discover that technology and market uncertainties differentially moderate the relationship between MSC and performance; the former has a positive effect, and the latter has a negative effect. The authors also discuss the theoretical and practical implications of their findings.","['nanDECISION-PROCESSES', 'ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMISM', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'RATIONALITY', 'ORIENTATION', 'ADVANTAGE', 'FRAMEWORK', 'CONFLICT', 'MANAGERS']","['performance', 'conflict']",comprehensiveness marketing strategy comprehensiveness task conflict implementation speed
"Patent litigation has attracted scholarly attention to reconcile multiple views for new research. Accordingly, this paper addresses patent litigation strategy and its effect on the firm. Based on 106 papers and articles, six books, the author's logic and practice impressions, it first defines patent litigation strategy and differentiates similar concepts. Second, based on the process, the author fine-tunes patent litigation strategy into three tactics: threat, filing and verdict. Then, she categorizes and examines the impact of patent litigation on market value, monetary gain/loss and strategic collaboration. The findings show that the effect on the market value is more complex and ambiguous than anticipated, and sometimes contradictory. The analysis shows the consistency of monetary effect in practice, that firms tend to have higher monetary gains from private settlement than from legal awards. It also demonstrates that existing studies lag behind reality in investigating the detailed role of patent litigation on strategic collaboration from partnership (e.g. licensing and strategic alliance) to takeover (i.e. merger and acquisition). Finally, the author reflects on the findings, and maps out critical paths toward new research. This process also reveals that stakeholders, industrial settings and country environments moderate the studied relationship. This paper contributes to knowledge and practice: appreciates the interdisciplinary endeavors to draw the findings; categorizes patent litigation and its effect; and critiques prior studies on the relationship to integrate knowledge for future research.","['nanINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY', 'SETTLEMENT', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'IMPACT', 'SHADOW', 'RIGHTS', 'PERSPECTIVES', 'MANAGEMENT']","['settlement', 'impact']",litigation market value industrial
"A hitherto neglected phenomenon in international new venturing is portfolio entrepreneurship, which occurs when entrepreneurs found, own, manage and control more than one business at a time, with ownership of the new venture being distinct from that of the existing business ventures. This study introduces the phenomenon of portfolio entrepreneurship in international new venturing through a longitudinal study of a cluster of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Tasmania, Australia, where 6 of 11 firms in the cluster were international new ventures (INVs). The pattern of international portfolio entrepreneurship pursued by the Tasmanian entrepreneurs and coupling between firms is described. Key findings include the ability of portfolio entrepreneurs to leverage high-discretion slack resources, positive legitimacy spillovers, and learning effects and experimentation across loosely coupled INVs in the portfolio. The findings also identify dysfunctional elements of portfolio entrepreneurship, and cast doubt over the conventional use of 'the firm' as the focal unit of analysis in INV studies. A particular contribution of this study is to remind us of the richness and pluralism inherent in international new venturing. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

"Salesperson learning has the potential to contribute to the competitive advantage of the firm by increasing its capacity for organizational learning. The relationship between employee and organizational learning is often taken-for-granted, yet the relationship between the two is complicated. The transfer of individual learning to the organizational level can not always be assumed. The authors examine this relationship, focusing on the facilitating role of organizational climate for learning and information dissemination efficiency in translating salesperson learning to organizational learning. The model, tested using a sample of 422 respondents from 113 retail stores in a national chain, is partly supported. Individual learning was found to be postitively associated with organizational learning and organizational climate for learning had a positive moderating effect on this relationship. The hypothesized moderating effect of information dissemination efficiency was insignificant.

"The advent of social media has challenged companies as sole creators of marketing messages. Whether intentionally branded or subconsciously promoted, users become ambassadors for products and brands by producing and disseminating user-generated content (UGC). Whereas previous studies on UGC have mainly considered verbal peer recommendations or written reviews, our research focuses on user-generated videos (UGVs). In our 2 (source: user vs. agency) x 2 (technical quality: low vs. high) experimental study, we explore the impact of user-generated videos (UGVs) vs. agency-generated videos (AGVs) on spectators' perceived source credibility and their intention to visit the tourist destination Tyrol in Austria, as promoted in the video. In addition, we explore the moderating role of video quality. In contrast to conventional wisdom, our results indicate that there is no general superiority of UGVs over AGVs. Rather, the influence of different video generators (user vs. agency) on spectators' perception and intended behavior depends on the technical quality of the video. In the case of low technical quality, users as generators have a significantly stronger positive effect on source trustworthiness - and expertise and thereby on consumers' intended behaviors - than AGVs. However, no impact from the generating source on trustworthiness has been found under the condition of highly technical quality. Concerning source expertise, videos generated by users are rated more highly than agency-generated videos under both low and high technical qualities, but the advantage is significantly lower under high technical quality. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of user-generated content overall and relativize the widely assumed general superiority of user-generated content over commercial, firm-generated content, at least in the case of videos.

"This research investigates the learning that occurs throughout several information acquisition and choice experiences. The effects of three factors that may naturally vary in consumer experiences are studied: a consumer's goals, how much the consumer knows about the product's features prior to information acquisition and choice, and the content of feedback received after choice. Results show that the information consumers learn is organized in memory around the goal(s) that drives the experiences. Further, higher levels of prior feature knowledge result in more accurate knowledge after experience, but, contrary to predictions, subjects with no prior feature knowledge are quite adept at focusing on their goal in the choice process and at learning goal-appropriate information. The presence of feedback and its consistency with a consumer's goal are also shown to affect the goal orientation and organization of brand and feature knowledge gained during choice experiences.","['nanSEARCH BEHAVIOR', 'FREE-RECALL', 'INFORMATION', 'MEMORY', 'CATEGORIES', 'CONSUMERS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'PERSPECTIVES', 'EXPERTISE', 'QUALITY']","['information', 'memory', 'consumers']",memory knowledge

Such an approach to developing cross-national models has been often suggested but seldom implemented.

"Firms in various worldwide locations are repeatedly subjected to radical political, economic, and social upheavals, including changes in administrative governance, new economic paradigms, natural disasters, and warfare. Perhaps because of the difficulty of conducting research in these environments, little is known regarding the unique requirements of entrepreneurs and their business organizations in such troubled locations. Reliable research and information is necessary in order to design and assess methods of providing institutional support both during and after, such turmoil. Based on data collected from field interviews over a six-month period this article examines the characteristics of the owners of 64 small manufacturing businesses that have undergone or were experiencing radical political and economic upheaval in the West Bank town of Ramallah in the Palestinian Territories. The objective of the study is to examine characteristics that influence and assist an entrepreneur's resource allocation decision-making processes. This was done by comparatively assessing the effects on profitability of both firm and individual assets in a highly constrained rapidly changing environment. Understanding this allocation process will lead to more effective targeted assistance in regions experiencing or exiting environmental transitions and upheavals. Human capital theory is utilized in this study as a framework for understanding the comparative response of owners to reallocate resources under the stressful environment of the pre- and post-intifada West Bank territories. While human capital has been well studied in literature examining resource allocation in typical competitive environments, our understanding of the influence of human capital in transitional environments is quite limited. This study provides some useful, and perhaps surprising results, from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Owner's human capital (coded from formal education) was found to impact profitability only with the micro firms studied (those with three or fewer employees), however. it is possible that this finding reflects dilution of human capital in comparatively larger small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). One interesting departure from similar studies is that experience was nor found to affect the profitability of the firm. Plans capital, on the other hand, was found to be associated with the profitability of only larger SMEs, controlling for business age and experience of the owner This finding is significant because, presently. institutions such as the World Bank. NGOs and national development agencies focus their efforts primarily on providing credit to small businesses, whereas training and education currently are somewhat out of favor. A model is proposed in this study comparing resource requirements according to both the size and the productivity/technological level of the firm. The object is to explain the reduced importance of human capital and experience in environments of radical transition, specifically the arbitrary nature and lack of predictability of transitional governance. and the increased importance of financial capital only with large SMEs. It is argued that skills acquired in functional expertise do not necessarily prepare an entrepreneur fbr the abrupt environmental transformations characteristic of tumultuous political events. This research suggests that owners are in a better position to maximize their cognitive skills in decision making within smaller organizations. However, these skills are naturally diffused and so less effective at influencing the outcomes of somewhat larger organizations. Larger SMEs are necessarily more capital intensive and more bureaucratic, and so the cumulative human capital at the organizational level may be more important to allocative efficiency than the human capital of the individual firm owner Further, larger SMEs require organizational expertise that may not be captured in the individual level characteristics of entrepreneurs. This research suggests that efforts to support such environments should carefully consider the size of the firms in question before designing and implementing programs of assistance, differentiating microenterprises from small businesses. In particular, the findings of this study suggest that smaller firms experiencing rapid environmental upheaval will benefit most from formal education. training and advice. Larger firms. in contrast. appear to benefit most from loans providing traditional capital support, and from advice ac ross the entire firm's human capital base, particularly regarding organizational management and delegation skills.

"Time in firm internationalization has different dimensions: it might refer to the early start of international activities, the speed of international growth, or to its pace and rhythm. This contribution considers the first dimension mentioned, viz. precocity, and aims at understanding which variables determine an early international orientation. Building on a literature review, a theoretical framework is proposed in order to integrate a fragmented literature body. The framework is then tested through an analysis on a sample of 144 SMEs. Among the drivers of early internationalization the role of the previous experience of the entrepreneur, and especially of their international experience, frequently nurtured in internationally oriented family firms on one side or in multinational/foreign firms on the other one, was found significant. The positive association between precocity and niche positioning of the business enforces the relevance of entrepreneurship because focalization is a reflection of entrepreneurial orientation and strategic decisions.

Drawing on the upper echelons theory, we conceive generational involvement as a proxy of knowledge diversity in multigenerational family TMTs. We argue that while moderate levels of generational involvement stimulate task-related constructive conflicts for EO, increased kinship distance and relationship conflicts led by high levels of generational involvement are likely to undermine this potential advantage by damaging the relational context for EO. Our hypothesis is confirmed on a data set of 199 family firms.","['nanMODERATING ROLE', 'KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION', 'ORGANIZATIONAL GROUPS', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'RISK-TAKING', 'PERFORMANCE', 'DIVERSITY', 'CONFLICT', 'INNOVATION', 'DEMOGRAPHY']","['diversity', 'conflict']",generational top management team entrepreneurial orientation upper echelons knowledge family firms
"Purpose - Vehicle manufacturer CarCo has spent decades developing its supply strategy based on customer ordered production. Yet the combination of an over-crowded European market and the need to grow sales poses a dilemma: what strategy does it adopt to manage its global operations? This research aims to examine the implementation of responsive operations and supply strategy to analyse how and why a firm's strategy changes over time. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the observations from a two-day workshop held for 50 managers at the firm's headquarters, the paper explores theoretical and practitioner implications for the continued development and implementation of build-to-order (BTO) as a cornerstone of supply strategy. Findings - Despite considerable capability at functional and business level, CarCo must address corporate and industry factors in order to raise responsiveness. Managers understand the conflict between operational and supply strategies presented here, yet are limited in the extent they can act on this knowledge due to the multi-level aspect of strategy and difficulties over control beyond the boundary of the firm. Practical implications - Key performance indicators need to be modified to gauge individual sale profitability, alongside new incentives and measures to overcome demand distortion and supplier game-playing. Further, the balance between flexibility investment and better customer fulfilment should be explored through cost analysis. Originality/value - Presents a managerial perspective of supply chain strategy development, analysed through a structured academic lens. The paper illustrates the increasingly dynamic nature of supply chains and the importance of connections between retail distribution, manufacturing, and in-bound supply as part of the global operation.","['supply', 'customization', 'operations management', 'automotive industry', 'corporative strategyPRODUCT VARIETY', 'IMPACT', 'CHAIN', 'FLEXIBILITY', 'VOLUME']","['supply', 'chain', 'flexibility']",implementation responsive operations strategy

"Informed by social exchange theory, this study examines whether and how employees reciprocate to their organizations for the idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) they receive. Specifically, the authors examined whether i-deals (in scheduling flexibility and professional development) are related to employees' flexible work role orientation, social networking behavior, and organizational trust over time. In turn, they hypothesized that these mediating variables would be positively related to employees' use of constructive voice. Data were collected from 466 managers and professionals in the United States and China at three points in time over a 10-month period. The data analyses revealed that flexible work role orientation, social networking behavior, and organizational trust all mediated the relationship between i-deals and voice behavior. Furthermore, the mediating effects were generally stronger for professional development i-deals than for scheduling flexibility i-deals and were generally stronger in the China sample than in the U.S. sample. The article concludes with a discussion of the utility of social exchange theory as a framework for future research on i-deals and for guiding the implementation of i-deals in organizational settings.","['idiosyncratic deals', 'voice', 'social exchange', 'flexible work role orientation', 'networking', 'organizational trustSOCIAL-EXCHANGE', 'CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'I-DEALS', 'INDIVIDUALISM-COLLECTIVISM', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT', 'CULTURES-CONSEQUENCES', 'ORGANIZATIONAL TRUST', 'RESPONSE QUALITY', 'POLITICAL SKILL', 'EMPLOYEE VOICE']","['idiosyncratic deals', 'idiosyncratic deals', 'voice', 'social exchange', 'social exchange', 'flexible work role orientation', 'flexible work role orientation', 'flexible work role orientation', 'flexible work role orientation', 'networking', 'i deals', 'i deals', 'organizational trust', 'organizational trust']",social exchange theory deals i deals scheduling flexibility professional organizational trust
"This study addresses two important global trends: protection of public goods, specifically the environment, and the emergence of multiethnic societies with influential minority groups. The study tests the effect of a government proenvironmental demarketing campaign on the deconsumption behavior of minority groups and the majority population. It suggests that minority consumers use consumption or deconsumption to manifest their social identity, beliefs, and goals as minorities in relation to the majority and that their motivation to respond positively to a government's demarketing campaign is shaped by their national attachment levels. The study was conducted in Jerusalem, Israel, and involved a large data set (N = 66,272) containing household-level data on actual behavior of consumers. The studied groups involved the majority of non-ultra-Orthodox Jews and three minority groups: Israeli Arabs, ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Jewish Russian immigrants. The findings show that in a proenvironmental context, government demarketing is more effective on the majority group than on any of the three minority groups. In addition, minority groups with lower national attachment levels respond more negatively to the demarketing effort. However, higher education levels lead to a more positive response across the majority and minority groups. A central implication of the findings is related to the benefits derived from demarketing for different consumer groups (majorities versus minorities based on religion, ethnicity, and immigration status). The findings also provide a benchmark for demarketing efforts in an environmental context. Finally, they suggest that policy makers and marketers should consider using demarketing more to complement regulatory and economic tools.","['demarketing', 'minority groups', 'national attachment', 'public goods', 'public policy', 'environmental behaviorCORPORATE ENVIRONMENTALISM', 'CONSUMER ACCULTURATION', 'MARKETING-STRATEGY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'SELF', 'IDENTITY', 'ISRAEL', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'WATER', 'DISTINCTIVENESS']","['demarketing', 'minority groups', 'minority groups', 'national attachment', 'national attachment', 'public goods', 'public goods', 'behavior', 'identity', 'israel']",protection demarketing consumers benefits
"How do social cues in the immediate environment affect older consumers' tendency to feel younger? And what is the impact of this tendency on consumption? This research investigates the malleability of older consumers' feel-age and the underlying mechanisms by focusing on the influence of contextual social cues and the downstream effects on consumption behavior. Five studies provide evidence that the mere presence of young social cues triggers an identity threat for older consumers; and feeling younger is a way to protect the self from negative stereotypes associated with aging. By contrast, young consumers are relatively immune to age-related social cues. Whereas the presence of young social cues magnifies older consumers' tendency to feel younger, this effect is attenuated when the young social cues are less desirable or when the older consumers possess higher self-esteem. The greater tendency to feel younger in the presence of young social cues increases older consumers' choice of contemporary over traditional products, especially among those with lower self-esteem. Theoretical insights and practical implications are discussed.","['older consumers', 'feel-age', 'social cues', 'identity threat', 'self-esteem', 'product choiceLOW SELF-ESTEEM', 'COGNITIVE AGE', 'SUBJECTIVE AGE', 'STEREOTYPE THREAT', 'IDENTITY THREAT', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'LIFE-SPAN', 'PERFORMANCE', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'CONSUMPTION']","['older consumers', 'older consumers', 'feel age', 'feel age', 'social cues', 'social cues', 'identity threat', 'identity threat', 'self esteem', 'self esteem', 'identity threat', 'identity threat', 'consumption']",identity choice

The current study uses agency theory, and broadens this perspective by examining the differential impact of institutional investors' stockholding, managerial stock ownership, and corporate board characteristics on the rate of adoption of six provisions, including provisions which do and do not require stockholder approval. Results of hazard analyses of the rate of amendment adoption of 185 firms between 1984 and 1988 indicate that the impact of governance variables on antitakeover provisions differ depending on whether these actions require stockholder approval or not. The pattern of differences indicates that institutional investors use their voting power when they are given an opportunity to vote and that substitution between direct shareholder control and managerial stock ownership exists.","['antitakeover provisions', 'agency theory', 'boards of directors', 'governance mechanismsPOISON PILL SECURITIES', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'CHARTER AMENDMENTS', 'STOCKHOLDER WEALTH', 'GOLDEN PARACHUTES', 'BOARD COMPOSITION', 'LARGE SHAREHOLDERS', 'VOTING-RIGHTS', 'AGENCY THEORY', 'STOCK-PRICES']","['antitakeover provisions', 'antitakeover provisions', 'agency theory', 'agency theory', 'agency theory', 'agency theory']",corporate governance agency theory
"Extending our understanding of the effects of perceived product creativity, this study contributes to the literature by empirically investigating the influence of cultural values on the relationship between the creativity dimensions of novelty and meaningfulness and intention to buy. Schwartz's values framework is employed to theorize cultural differences. The results, based upon 206 Italian and 201 US consumers surveyed via a mall-intercept approach, indicate that novelty is a more important dimension of product creativity in the US (i.e., a low-resultant conservative/high-resultant self-enhancement culture) than in Italy (i.e., a high-resultant conservatism/low-resultant self-enhancement culture) in influencing intention to buy and that meaningfulness is a more important dimension of creativity in Italy than in the US in influencing intention to buy. These results provide important standardization/adaptation implications for international marketing academics and practitioners.

"Flat rates are a dominant pricing scheme in many consumer service industries that largely benefit service providers: Many customers exhibit a bias and choose flat rates even though a pay-per-use plan would be less expensive for them. Yet, whereas the degree of flat-rate bias varies strongly across services, no study has determined whether consumers' consumption goals might influence its extent. The authors argue and show that consuming services to attain hedonic gratification leads to a significantly higher flat-rate bias than using services to fulfill utilitarian needs. The three well-known flat-rate bias effects (taximeter, insurance, and overestimation) fully mediate the relationship between the consumption goal and flat-rate bias. In three experimental studies, the authors consistently show that these findings apply across different services, for a service that relies on natural variance in customers' consumption goals, and for the same service framed as hedonic, utilitarian, or a hybrid. These findings show that managers need to be aware of major ``natural'' industry differences in the level of flat-rate bias. However, service providers can also actively manage and increase consumers' hedonic consumption goals for their services and thus increase their share of flat-rate contracts. A further experiment shows that the hedonization tactic has no negative side effects on consumers' price perceptions in terms of willingness to pay (WTP). Service providers can benefit from hedonizing their services as long as it is compatible with their value proposition.","['flat-rate bias', 'consumption goal', 'hedonic', 'utilitarian', 'service', 'pricingCONSUMER CHOICE', 'AVAILABILITY', 'MEDIATION', 'PATTERNS', 'DECISION', 'MODEL']","['flat rate bias', 'flat rate bias', 'flat rate bias', 'consumption goal', 'consumption goal', 'hedonic', 'utilitarian', 'service']",flat rates consumption goals gratification overestimation
"Companies increasingly face product harm crises resulting in product recalls, which often have a negative impact on firm value. Whereas prior research has studied the short-term effects of product recalls on firm value, the authors of this article focus on the long-term effects. They develop a conceptual framework and hypotheses about the main effect of recall volume and the moderating effects of crisis management strategies on the relationship between recall volume and long-term firm value. They empirically test the hypotheses in the auto industry context using both short-term abnormal returns analysis and long-term calendar-time portfolio analysis of 280 product recalls during 2005-2015. The findings reveal that the negative impact of product recall volume lingers over time. Brand (promotion) advertising has a significant positive (negative) effect on the relationship between recall volume and long-term abnormal returns. Furthermore, both voluntary recall initiation and postrecall remedial efforts positively moderate the impact of recall volume on long-term returns. These moderating effects are contrary to those in the short term. The results suggest that managers should use different advertising types during and after a recall, strategically initiate recalls, and diligently prepare postrecall remedies to mitigate the negative effects of recall volume on long-term return.","['product recall', 'firm value', 'crisis management', 'advertising', 'long-term effectsSOCIAL MEDIA', 'HARM CRISES', 'MARKET', 'SALES', 'IMPACT', 'RETURNS', 'EVENT', 'RISK', 'INFORMATION', 'INNOVATIONS']","['product recall', 'product recall', 'firm value', 'firm value', 'crisis management', 'crisis management', 'advertising', 'harm crises', 'harm crises', 'impact', 'returns']",product recalls impact crisis management abnormal returns brand promotion
"We investigated structural support as a work design characteristic potentially enabling employee effectiveness in demanding contexts, proposing that structural support enhances job and role outcomes for employees but that effects depend on both the outcome under consideration (job vs. role) and the employees themselves. We tested hypotheses in a within-persons quasi-experiment in which 48 hospital doctors carried out their work with and without structural support. Structural support had positive effects on perceived core job performance, and these effects were stronger for individuals with higher clarity about others' work roles, suggesting that individuals can better mobilize available support when clear about how to allocate it. Support was also associated with improved role outcomes although, consistently with conservation of resources theory, effects differed with affect. For individuals with higher negative work affect, structural support was associated with lowered perceived role overload (a resource protection mechanism). For individuals with lower negative work affect, support was associated with higher perceived skill utilization and proactive work behavior (a resource accumulation mechanism). We approach social support at work in a novel way, extend relational approaches to work design, and show the value of considering both job and role outcomes in work redesign research.","['nanSOCIAL SUPPORT', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'RESOURCE LOSS', 'PROACTIVE PERSONALITY', 'SKILL-UTILIZATION', 'THINGS HAPPEN', 'WORK', 'STRESS', 'DESIGN', 'CONSERVATION']","['job performance', 'job performance', 'skill utilization', 'skill utilization', 'work', 'design', 'conservation']",work design performance resources research
"Research summary: Most strategic management studies adopt an average-centered view that uses the central tendency to explain between-group variation in performance (i.e., performance differences between business units, firms, industries, and countries). In this study, we explain within-group variation using a variance-centered view that focuses on the peripheral characteristics of performance distributions as defined by skew and heavy tails (i.e., variance and kurtosis). Drawing on performance feedback theory, we hypothesize that successful firms tend to develop a positive skew in their performance distributions, which we call a positive skew effect in this study, and that heavy tails moderate this effect. Our analysis of the performance of a group of foreign affiliates provides general support for our hypotheses at both the firm and segment (industry and country) levels. Managerial summary: Managers of multi-business firms use various approaches to improve the aggregate performance of their business units. Some expand the range of upper performance outliers (exploration) or reduce the range of lower outliers (downsizing); others improve the performance of current business units (exploitation). We find that firms with superior performance tend to have a balanced mix of the three approaches. We also find that segments (countries and industries) with higher mean performances provide environments that facilitate the entry of productive firms and the exit of unproductive firms and provide environments in which incumbents can further improve their performance by learning from others. We observe that successful firms and segments have a positive skew in their performance distributions, which we call a positive skew effect.

"We introduce a new theoretical perspective for predicting effective monitoring, which involves a two-stage logic. First, we focus on individual directors, arguing that effective monitoring is highly likely when a given director possesses certain qualities. Based on prior research not previously coalesced, we set forth this baseline proposition: a director's likelihood of being an effective monitor in any given domain (say, financial matters) is greatly increased when he or she has all four of the following qualities: independence, expertise in that domain, bandwidth, and motivation. Second, we extend this quadrilateral model or quad model to make propositions at the board level. We argue that it is not sufficient for these four qualities to be distributed among all directors on a given board, since this makes it likely there will be no directors who can rise to the challenging task of monitoring. We propose that having just one quad-qualified director will be more predictive of board efficacy than will be any customary board descriptors. And we posit that if a board has two or more quad-qualified directors who can bolster and amplify each other, the company's likelihood of governance failures will be especially reduced. We discuss theoretical and practical implications and lay out a research agenda.","['nanAUDIT COMMITTEE', 'UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR', 'MINORITY INFLUENCE', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'RISK-TAKING', 'CEO', 'GOVERNANCE', 'AGENCY']",['governance'],failures

"This paper assesses economic, political and national institutional explanations for continued resistance to the multidivisional form in France, Germany and the United Kingdom during the 1980s and 1990s. It finds that the economics of different diversification strategies play a significant but changing role in the structural choices of large corporations. The political interests of personal, banking and government owners are exercised variably. There remain strong national influences on structural choices, with resistance to the multidivisional form particularly pronounced in Germany. Overall, our results call for an increased contextual sensitivity in management research while acknowledging the possibility of convergent processes in business organization, represented here by the slow progress of the multidivisional firm.","['nanRESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'BUSINESS GROUPS', 'STRATEGY', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'ORGANIZATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'CORPORATIONS', 'COMPANIES', 'ADOPTION']","['diversification', 'organization', 'management', 'corporations']",management firm
"Prior research has established the pivotal role of bilateral norms in relationship marketing, identifying them as effective relational governance mechanisms that firms can use to manage their international alliances with overseas intermediaries. Unfortunately, few studies have examined differential effects of specific norms on positive and negative behaviors, let alone norms' effectiveness in the harsh export context of resource -constrained small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To address these gaps, the authors explicate the effects of three norms (continuity expectations, equity, and cooperation) on both dysfunctional and productive behaviors of foreign distributors. Using two consecutive data collections, the results indicate that norms curb importer opportunism and help improve importer role performance and that continuity expectations and cooperation increase the chances of the survival of export ventures. The study further scrutinizes relational norms' effects on opportunism in the context of exporting SMEs' realities and tests relevant moderating effects. The findings indicate that while exporter dependence reduces the shielding effect of norms against opportunism, psychic distance and competitive intensity strengthen the protecting effect of relational norms. The results of this study underscore the heterogeneous nature of relational norms and suggest that norms such as continuity expectations play a leading role in structuring the ideology of a business dyad.","['exporter importer relationships', 'opportunism', 'relational norms', 'small and medium-sized enterprisesINTERNATIONAL MARKETING CHANNELS', 'BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS', 'RELATIONSHIP QUALITY', 'PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS', 'DISTRIBUTOR OPPORTUNISM', 'EXCHANGE RELATIONSHIPS', 'INDUSTRIAL-PRODUCTS', 'SMALL FIRMS', 'GOVERNANCE', 'ANTECEDENTS']","['opportunism', 'relational norms', 'relational norms', 'governance']",relational governance opportunism psychic distance

"Going ''public'' has a magical sound to most entrepreneurial managers. By going public the firm increases its legitimacy in the business community, improves access to debt financing, and creates a means of exit for major shareholders. However by far the most important reason for going public is to infuse a significant amount of investment capital into the firm. It is well documented that small businesses frequently fail because of insufficient funding and heavy debt loads. Issuing an initial public offering (IPO) allows entrepreneurial firms to overcome these pitfalls. Clear ly, if access to capital is the major goal of going public, then the success of an offering is measured by the amount of capital raised by the firm. This study presents a model of the total amount of capital raised by a firm through an IPO. The explanatory variables include several indicators of the scientific capabilities of the firm including the location of the firm, the quality of the research staff the number of products under development, the number of patents held by the firm, and the firm's prior spending on research and development (R&D). The model is empirically rested on a sample of 92 biotechnology IPOs. The results provide strong support for the hypothesized positive relationship between the total amount of capital raised by a firm's IPO and the scientific capabilities of the firm. Our results have important implications for entrepreneurs. First, an entrepreneur needs to develop and send credible signals indicating the value of the firm's intangible assets to the market. Second, the market values as deep a product pipeline as possible given a firm's resource constraints. Third, choice of location is a key strategic decision that should nor be overlooked. Fourth, the market values firm-specific capabilities and will increase the capital it is willing to invest in a firm accordingly. Finally, the amount of capital a firm mises in its IPO can be influenced by entrepreneurial managers' strategic decisions.

"An enduring belief is that unleashing low-level members of an organization to explore extensively will broaden the exploration conducted by the entire organization. Using an agent-based simulation model, we show that in multilevel organizations, increased exploration at lower levels can backfire, reducing overall exploration and diminishing performance in environments that require broad search. This result arises when interdependencies cut across the domains of low-level managers. With no cross-departmental interdependencies, more extensive low-level exploration can improve firm performance. Our findings show that careful attention to information processing in multilevel organizations can shed light on whether, and when, decentralization encourages innovation.","['nanMODEL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INNOVATION', 'DECENTRALIZATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'EVOLUTION', 'STRATEGY', 'SYSTEMS', 'FIT']","['performance', 'innovation', 'decentralization']",innovation
"Theories from information systems and strategic marketing are integrated to develop a framework for understanding the direct, mediated, and moderated influences of contextual marketing and customer-orientation strategy on site satisfaction. Empirical testing shows that customers' perceived contextual marketing and customer-oriented strategies are associated with site satisfaction and loyalty. Departing from the simple linear-association approach, the study also investigates the moderating role of privacy concerns and site design complexity and the mediating role of perceived site value. It finds that the influence of contextual marketing and customer-orientation strategy on site satisfaction is moderated by the perceived complexity of the site design but not by consumer privacy concerns. These influences may also be mediated by perceived site value. Overall, the contextual marketing approach of providing personalized, real-time information to customers at the point of need will obtain competitive advantage in e-commerce.","['consumer behavior', 'contextual marketing', 'customer orientation', 'Internet marketing', 'privacy concernsRESOURCE-ADVANTAGE THEORY', 'PRIVACY CONCERNS', 'BUSINESS', 'WEB', 'EXPLORATION', 'INFORMATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INTERNET', 'ONLINE', 'CONSEQUENCES']","['contextual marketing', 'contextual marketing', 'customer orientation', 'customer orientation', 'privacy concerns', 'privacy concerns', 'information']",orientation loyalty perceived site value

"Virtual customer environments (VCE), which provide services ranging from online discussion forums to virtual design toolkits, enable firms to involve their customers in innovation and value creation. Evidently, companies can benefit from operating such VCEs; however, most firms do not seem to attach sufficient importance to the nature of customers' interactions in the VCE. In this study, we examine two critical implications of customers' interactions in a product-support focused VCE. First, we suggest that customers' perceptions of interaction-based benefits will shape their future participation in product support in the VCE. Second, customers' interactions will also generate changes in their affective states, and these, in turn, influence their attitude towards the firm. Our empirical work provides broad support for the study hypotheses and implies the need for firms to carefully design and implement VCEs that facilitate positive interaction experiences for customers. Implications with respect to customer value co-creation and customer relationship management are discussed.","['nanBRAND COMMUNITY', 'SOCIAL-INFLUENCE', 'INNOVATION', 'INTERNET', 'INFORMATION', 'ONLINE', 'USERS', 'FIRM', 'GRATIFICATIONS', 'PARTICIPATION']","['innovation', 'online', 'firm', 'participation']",design innovation discussed

Building upon a family embeddedness perspective, we develop hypotheses about curvilinear relationships between the proportion of family ties in entrepreneurs' networks and venture growth.

These effects appear to be related to the type of entrepreneurs' social network (business advice, emotional support, and business resources). Our results confirm effects specific to each network: an inverted U-shape for advice and emotional support networks but a U-shape for the business resource network, measuring what proportion of kin in each entrepreneurial network type is valuable to or, conversely, undermines new venture growth.","['nanCOMMON METHOD VARIANCE', 'ECONOMIC-ACTION', 'FIRM NETWORKS', 'RISK-TAKING', 'EMBEDDEDNESS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'RESOURCES', 'BUSINESS', 'CONFLICT', 'IMPACT']","['embeddedness', 'resources', 'business']",embeddedness networks

"The concept of psychic distance has several entrenched assumptions that have not been put to sufficient systematic scrutiny. We address this gap by investigating the assumptions of symmetry (i.e., whether psychic distance from Country A to Country B is the same as that from Country B to Country A) and discordance (i.e., whether differences in psychic distance between two countries always lead to lack of fit) of psychic distance in cross-border mergers and acquisitions. We propose a new framework, which differentiates between the extent (i.e., the degree to which two countries are perceived to be similar/different) and effects (i.e., the degree to which distance perceptions create favorable or unfavorable attitudes and responses) of psychic distance perceptions. We argue that relative status positions affect extent and effects of psychic distance. To test our predictions, we collected data through policy-capturing studies in Sweden and China. Our findings reveal that both the extent and the effects of psychic distance perceptions are asymmetric. We also found that psychic distance perceptions create unfavorable (favorable) attitudes among Swedish (Chinese) respondents toward Chinese (Swedish) acquirers. Our follow-up examination confirms that relative status positions are a key driver of these results.","['psychic distance', 'symmetry', 'cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M &', 'status', 'social comparison', 'experimental designsNATIONAL CULTURAL DISTANCE', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXTS', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'INTEGRATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SELF', 'MERGERS']","['psychic distance', 'psychic distance', 'symmetry', 'status', 'mergers']",psychic
"This study investigates consumers' relationship to possessions in the condition of contemporary global nomadism. Prior research argues that consumers form enduring and strong attachments to possessions because of their centrality to identity projects. This role is heightened in life transitions including cross-border movements as possessions anchor consumer's identities either to their homeland or to the host country. This study reexamines this claim via in-depth interviews with elite global nomads, deterritorialized consumers who engage in serial relocation and frequent short-term international mobility. An alternative relationship to possessions characterized by detachment and flexibility emerges, which is termed liquid. Three characteristics of a liquid relationship to possessions are identified: temporary situational value, use-value, and immateriality. The study outlines a logic of nomadic consumption, that of instrumentality, where possessions and practices are strategic resources in managing mobility. A liquid perspective on possessions expands current understandings of materiality, acculturation, and globalization.","['nanCONSUMER ACCULTURATION', 'CONSUMPTION', 'IDENTITY', 'CULTURE', 'THINGS', 'TRANSITION', 'CATTLE', 'SELF', 'FOOD']","['consumption', 'identity', 'transition']",global nomadism relocation acculturation globalization
"Strategic management research has been characterized as placing less emphasis on construct measurement than other management subfields. In this work, we document the state of the art of measurement in strategic management research, and discuss the implications for interpreting the results of research in this field. To assess the breadth of measurement issues in the discipline, we conducted a content analysis of empirical strategic management articles published in leading journals in the period of 1998-2000. We found that few studies discuss reliability and validity issues, and empirical research in the field commonly relies on single-indicator measures. Additionally, studies rarely address the problems of attenuation due to measurement error. We close with a discussion of the implications for future research and for interpreting prior work in strategic management.

"In this article, we propose an analytical tool, named the Workload Profile Diagnosis (WPD) method, to evaluate the performance and quality of incident management (IM) systems in information technology (IT) service factories. Based on the normalization of ticket assignment delay and resolution time by their respective service-level agreement, the method computes and plots the spreading of ticket data on a log-log chart. By comparing the actual and desired distribution values in specific areas, the WPD method diagnoses specific problems and issues in the performance of IM systems such as resource and skill allocation and abnormal behavior, and identifies opportunities for automated resolution or assignment of tickets, increases or decreases in the resources and skills needed, and ultimately aims to strike a better balance between productivity and service quality. In addition to an in-depth description of the WPD method, this article presents its application in the diagnostics of four service pools of a large IT service factory. An empirical study conducted in the IT service factory shows that most of the problems identified by the WPD method were indeed present in the service pools, therefore providing evidence of the validity of the WPD method. We conclude discussing how managers can use the method to detect and evaluate transformational opportunities to increase productivity and service quality in a systematic manner.","['incident management', 'service delivery', 'IT services', 'IT outsourcing', 'service-level agreements', 'service engineering', 'service analyticsnan']","['incident management', 'incident management']",workload diagnosis incident management service

The three most prevalent perspectives in mainstream organization development (OD) literature understand resistance as something within the individual's psychological disposition, in the social context, and between change creators and acceptors. The habitus-oriented approach presented here, on the contrary, understands resistance as a social practice built into the system and produced by social agents' (individuals and groups) habitus, a cognitive construct that represents not the personal or the social roots of resistance but the combined dialectic roots of the two.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'PIERRE BOURDIEU', 'MANAGEMENT', 'CONTEXT']",['context'],
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the concept of supply chain resilience (SCRES) within a concept mapping framework to seek conceptual clarity, with an emphasis on SCRES definitions, essential elements and managerial practices. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic literature review was conducted of 103 peer-reviewed journal articles from the year 2000 to 2015, with the aim of answering a focus review question. Findings - Through analysis and synthesis of the literature, the study revealed three major constructs used to define SCRES: phases of resilience, resilience strategies and the capabilities needed to be resilient. Emerging from the capabilities construct are five core SCRES capabilities: the ability to anticipate, to adapt, to respond, to recover and to learn. Also, given the need to consolidate the various constructs of SCRES, the study identified 13 essential elements and 84 managerial practices that support firms to achieve the five capabilities, which are then linked to SCRES strategies and phases to establish the connections that provide an integrated view of the concept. Research limitations/implications - The explorative nature of this study and the role of the concept mapping framework, which does not empirically test the relationships in the model, are considered as limitations, to be addressed by the authors in future research. Originality/value - The originality of this paper lies in the classification of different features of SCRES through a comprehensive concept mapping framework that establishes relationships and interactions between them. This study, therefore, lays a foundation for testing these connections in future empirical studies. The paper brings together fragmented literature from multiple studies to create a solid body of knowledge that addresses the need for conceptual clarity in SCRES literature.","['Resilience', 'Supply-chain management', 'Systematic literature reviewPUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS', 'RISK-MANAGEMENT', 'CYBER-RESILIENCE', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'DISRUPTION', 'NETWORK', 'DESIGN', 'AGILE', 'FLEXIBILITY', 'SELECTION']","['resilience', 'design']",supply chain resilience concept mapping systematic literature review capabilities

"We fill a gap in the resource-based literature by identifying conditions and mechanisms that make a resource valuable to a firm ex ante that is, before a decision on acquiring or building it is made. These conditions are (1) the firm's ex ante market position; (2) its ex ante resource base, which allows for complementarities; (3) its position in interorganizational networks, which gives it access to privileged information; and (4) the prior knowledge and experience of its managers, which allow superior judgment concerning the value-creating potential of the resource. These factors help explain why firms initially differ in how much value they attribute to a resource and, subsequently, why firms differ in their resource endowments. Our results also contribute to resource management theories by highlighting the role of managerial judgment in acquiring and accumulating resources and, thus, shaping firms' paths toward superior competitive positions. Furthermore, identifying firms' market positions and managerial judgment about demand-side value creation opportunities as resource value drivers highlights the importance of demand-side factors to strategic outcomes. We also discuss how our findings may open avenues for further studies and provide a basis for empirical tests of the resource-based view of strategic management.","['nanSTRATEGIC FACTOR MARKETS', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'VALUE CREATION', 'CAUSAL AMBIGUITY', 'INSTITUTIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'USEFUL PERSPECTIVE', 'EMPIRICAL-RESEARCH', 'DOMINANT LOGIC', 'VALUE CAPTURE']","['value creation', 'value creation']",interorganizational networks information knowledge resource management value creation based view

Path-analytic tests using data collected from supervisor-subordinate dyads at two time points suggest that supervisor perceptions of relationship conflict and subordinate performance mediate the relationship between perceived deep-level dissimilarity and abusive supervision and that relationship conflict mediates that between perceived deep-level dissimilarity and abusive supervision when supervisors perceive subordinates as having low performance.","['nanDIVERSE WORK GROUPS', 'MORAL EXCLUSION', 'PERCEIVED SIMILARITY', 'SURFACE-LEVEL', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'AGGRESSION', 'BEHAVIORS', 'WORKPLACE', 'DISENGAGEMENT', 'DEMOGRAPHY']","['moral exclusion', 'moral exclusion', 'workplace']",workplace
"The present research examines how hedonic and utilitarian purchase motivations influence consumers' perceptions of their product preferences and the resulting number of options they wish to consider when making a purchase. Across six studies, consumers choose to review larger assortments when their purchase motivation is hedonic rather than when their purchase motivation is utilitarian. This effect occurs because consumers with hedonic purchase motivations perceive their product preferences as highly unique compared to consumers with utilitarian purchase motivations. Higher perceived preference uniqueness increases the difficulty consumers anticipate in finding a preference-matching product, resulting in an expansion of the number of product alternatives to review. Further supporting the perceived preference uniqueness account, the documented effect is attenuated when product assortments are customized based on consumers' personal preferences and when a social similarity priming task is employed. These findings provide additional evidence on the distinction between hedonic and utilitarian purchase motivations, their impact on perceived preference uniqueness, and their implications for consumer decision making via assortment size choice.","['hedonic', 'utilitarian', 'purchase motivation', 'perceived preference uniqueness', 'assortment size choiceCONSUMER CHOICE', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'VARIETY', 'NEED', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'CONSUMPTION', 'RELEVANCE', 'FEELINGS', 'IDENTITY', 'CONTEXT']","['hedonic', 'utilitarian', 'purchase motivation', 'purchase motivation', 'perceived preference uniqueness', 'perceived preference uniqueness', 'perceived preference uniqueness']",perceived preference uniqueness
"This paper proposes an empirical test of several hypotheses linking age, order of entry, and strategic orientations to a firm's performance. Three strategies are defined: cost-leadership strategy, innovative differentiation, and marketing differentiation The aim is to show that the impact on performance of both age and each of the three strategic orientations may differ according to a firm's order of entry into an industry. Following Lieberman and Montgomery's (1998) evaluation of their major contribution on first mover advantage, we emphasize three points. First, we develop and lest hypotheses related to early and late followers' strategic orientations, broadening the scope of traditional studies on pioneers. Second, the model combines the dimensions of a firm's age, order of entry, and strategic orientations, as well as industry conditions (stage of the industry, environmental unpredictability, and technology diffusion), to establish a contingent model of performance analysis. Finally, the empirical study deals chiefly with organizational performance and not market share, which is considered a typical advantage accruing to pioneers. In addition, the scope of the study (582 French manufacturing firms) provides the means to fill a void in empirical studies because it is a broad cross-sectional test on non-U.S. data. The firms are mainly private, small to medium-sized, and single or dominant business firms. Therefore, our assumptions must be understood as particularly applicable to this type of firm.","['nanRESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'MARKET SHARE', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', '1ST-MOVER ADVANTAGES', 'BUSINESS PERFORMANCE', 'GOODS INDUSTRIES', 'CONSUMER-GOODS', 'FIRM', 'INNOVATION', 'GROWTH']","['market share', 'market share', 'firm']",orientations
"Absorptive capacity (ACAP) refers to a firm's ability to acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit new knowledge. Research has yet to acknowledge the possibility of limits to the financial returns of this important strategic construct. This study suggests an inverted-U shaped relationship between ACAP and financial performance. Based on data from 285 technology-based small and medium enterprises, we observe gains within three prospective, secondary measures of growth to diminish beyond lower levels of ACAP, even turning negative and becoming harmful beyond intermediate levels. We find that entrepreneurial orientation (EO) moderates the ACAP-performance relationship, enhancing financial gains at lower levels of ACAP and mitigating the decline in financial performance at higher levels of ACAP. Further, with higher EO, higher ACAP can be achieved before financial returns diminish.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","['firm strategy', 'absorptive capacity', 'entrepreneurial orientation', 'curvilinearity', 'firm financial performanceINNOVATION', 'SUGGESTIONS', 'INFORMATION', 'RESOURCES', 'CONSTRUCT', 'GROWTH', 'MODEL']","['absorptive capacity', 'absorptive capacity', 'entrepreneurial orientation', 'entrepreneurial orientation', 'construct', 'growth']",absorptive capacity returns performance entrepreneurial orientation ltd
"Research on strategic leadership has proliferated for a long time. However, very little work has been conducted to investigate this issue from a cross-cultural perspective. To fill this gap, we first review recent findings on strategic leadership in different cultural backgrounds. Then, based on the upper echelons theory, we summarize what researchers have found regarding the effects of personal characteristics of strategic leaders on firm performance in terms of observed personal experience, personality, values, cognitive style, and leadership behaviors. Furthermore, we generate some future research directions focusing on concepts, theories, and also methodological issues of strategic leadership across cultures. We consider how research across different cultures will enrich our understanding of strategic leadership and unfold the black box of why and how strategic leaders have positive effects on firm level performance. Finally, practical implications for managers are considered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc..

"Evolving tastes can change the relative importance of product features in shaping consumers' purchase decisions, which in turn can shift the relative attractiveness of products with different feature levels. The challenge lies in finding a reliable yet cost-effective way to monitor the weights consumers place on various product features. In the context of the U.S. automotive market, the authors explore the potential of using trends in online searches for feature-related keywords as indicators of trends in the relative importance of the corresponding features (e.g., fuel economy, acceleration, cost to buy, cost to operate, body type). By augmenting marketing-mix data with feature search data in a market response model, they show substantial improvements in goodness-of-fit both in and out of sample. The authors find empirical support for the hypothesis that feature search trends are positively correlated with feature importance trends. They discuss how managers may make better decisions by monitoring feature search trends and leveraging those trends strategically.","['Google trends', 'market response model', 'product feature', 'conjoint analysis', 'big dataCONSUMER INFORMATION', 'EXTERNAL SEARCH', 'IMPACT', 'INTERNET', 'SALES', 'PRICES', 'CHOICE']","['market response model', 'market response model', 'market response model', 'product feature', 'product feature']",online marketing mix model
"The authors explore whether and why business-to-business customers using service relationship designs-service delivery systems that promote repeated personal interactions between a customer and a specific service provider-will adopt self-service technology (SST). Their results show that these customers associate operational performance gains and relational performance losses with a prospective SST Whereas perceived operational performance gains increase customers' intention to adopt SST perceived relational performance losses decrease it. However these main effects are moderated by customers' purchase frequency and their enacted service design, which refers to the way that customers actually experience firms' intended service designs. Specifically, the positive effect of perceived operational performance gains on customers' intention to adopt SST was weaker for customers with higher purchase frequency. Similarly, the negative effect of perceived relational performance losses on customers' intention to adopt SST was strongest for customers who had enacted strong service relationships.","['self-service technology', 'service relationships', 'technology adoptionPERCEIVED USEFULNESS', 'INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY', 'ACCEPTANCE MODEL', 'CONSUMER', 'EASE', 'SATISFACTION', 'BENEFITS', 'LOYALTY']","['self service technology', 'self service technology', 'self service technology', 'service relationships', 'service relationships', 'ease']",relationship designs self service technology
"Organizational downsizing to cut costs frequently creates new, hidden costs that neutralize potential increases in productivity. Customer dissatisfaction is such an overlooked downsizing outcome. Using longitudinal data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), Compustat, and a consumer survey this study analyzes satisfaction outcomes of downsizing. It extends research in this domain to B2C markets and explicitly addresses environmental influences on the downsizing-satisfaction link. Results indicate that there is a negative effect of downsizing on customer satisfaction. It is particularly pronounced for companies (1) with little organizational slack, (2) with high labor productivity, or (3) in industries with high R&D intensity. Moreover, downsizing has a stronger negative impact on customer satisfaction in product categories with (4) high risk importance and (5) low probability for consumer errors as well as (6) low level of brand consciousness. Furthermore, customer satisfaction mediates the effect of downsizing on financial performance. The results provide an explanation for why so many downsizing projects fail and what managers can do to prevent adverse effects of downsizing on customer satisfaction and financial performance.","['Customer satisfaction', 'Organizational downsizing', 'Firm performance', 'Panel data analysisPANEL-DATA', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LAYOFFS', 'IMPACT', 'BRAND', 'WORK', 'SURVIVORS', 'PRODUCTIVITY', 'STRATEGIES', 'TURNOVER']","['customer satisfaction', 'customer satisfaction', 'organizational downsizing', 'organizational downsizing', 'performance', 'impact', 'brand', 'productivity']",downsizing productivity customer dissatisfaction organizational slack impact brand consciousness performance

"Work interruptions are ubiquitous in today's workplaces as a result of the proliferation of technology and a growing emphasis on collaboration and open workspaces. Although a large body of research on interruptions has accumulated over the last two decades, this research is scattered across disciplines with little integration. While this fragmentation indicates the complex nature of interruptions, it has also led to inconsistencies in how interruptions are defined and studied. Such differences reduce generalizability of results, lead to conflicting findings, and hinder knowledge development. We present here an integrative review of prior research on work interruptions based on an analysis of 247 publications. As part of the review, we examine prior definitions of interruption and advance a new integrative definition that can anchor a range of future research. We also discuss and summarize the assumptions and implications of the different investigative approaches used to study interruptions. An awareness of these approaches can help scholars better align their theory and investigative approach to adequately capture constructs/relationships of interest. We then synthesize theory and research, across disciplines, to present a process-based model that comprehensively captures our current understanding of how, when, and why work interruptions affect employees in different ways. Lastly, we highlight several avenues in need of more research attention and provide recommendations on how to advance the work interruption literature ahead meaningfully. Our review can act as an important reference for scholars new to interruption research, as well as for established interruption researchers looking to move their research in new directions.","['work interruption', 'task interruption', 'distraction', 'disruption', 'intrusionPROSPECTIVE MEMORY', 'TASK-INTERRUPTION', 'WORKPLACE INTERRUPTIONS', 'INFORMATION OVERLOAD', 'EMAIL INTERRUPTIONS', 'ATTENTION RESIDUE', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'TIME PRESSURE', 'HEALTH-CARE', 'PERFORMANCE']","['work interruption', 'work interruption']",workplaces workspaces
"Research summary: Recent research rooted in the resource-based view of the firm suggests that resources are more likely to create value if they are effectively managed. An underlying assumption of the literature is that firms manage their resources on their own. However, many firms hire consultants to help them do so. In this study, I develop and test hypotheses regarding the impact of technical consultants on the quality of their clients' products. Using data from the Bordeaux wine industry, I find evidence that the use of technical consultants has a positive impact on relative product quality and a negative impact on the extremeness of relative product quality. Moreover, the positive impact of technical consultants on relative product quality is stronger at lower levels of relative resource quality.Managerial summary: Findings from a study in the Bordeaux wine industry indicate that the decision to hire consultants should depend on a firm's strategy. If a firm wants to improve its performance, it should hire consultants. Indeed, the best practices of technical consultants are generally more valuable than internally generated knowledge. If a firm wants to achieve outstanding performance, hiring consultants may not be the right decision. Because the best practices of technical consultants have more certain performance implications than internally generated knowledge, they decrease the likelihood of extremely low performance. However, their lack of uniqueness also decreases the likelihood of extremely high performance. Finally, the decision to hire consultants should depend on the quality of a firm's resources. Firms with low-quality resources tend to benefit more from the best practices of technical consultants.

"Although much of the existing research on employee sabotage and deviance focuses on the manufacturing sector studies have also found evidence of deliberate employee misbehavior in a variety of service settings. In this study, the authors conceptualize and test a model of service sabotage dynamics that incorporates both the antecedents and the consequences of such behaviors. In doing so, the study contributes contemporary empirical evidence of factors associated with the deliberate sabotage of service by frontline customer-contact personnel. Using a survey-based approach, the authors collected data from 259 respondents from a sample of 1,000 respondents. The findings largely support the hypothesized antecedents of service sabotage and show that a range of individual characteristics, management control efforts, and perceived labor market conditions are linked with service sabotage. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that service sabotage behaviors are associated with individual and group rewards, effects for customers, and other performance measures.","['service sabotage', 'employee deviance', 'service dysfunction', 'frontline employees', 'customer-contact employeesCONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS', 'FIT INDEXES', 'MANAGEMENT', 'CULTURE', 'EMPLOYEES', 'STRATEGY', 'ORIENTATION', 'PERSONALITY', 'COMMITMENT', 'RESISTANCE']","['service sabotage', 'service sabotage', 'management']",model performance
"Mass customization has received considerable interest among researchers. However, although many authors have analyzed this concept from different angles, the question of which factors can be used to spot customers most likely to adopt a mass-customized product has not been answered to a satisfactory extent until now. This article explicitly deals with this question by focusing on factors related to the base category, which is defined as the group of all standardized products within the same product category as the mass-customized product under investigation. Specifically, this article investigates the influence of a customer's base category consumption frequency and need satisfaction on the decision to adopt a mass-customized product within this base category. A set of competing hypotheses regarding these influences is developed and subsequently evaluated by a combination of partial least squares and latent class analysis. This is done by using a sample of 2,114 customers surveyed regarding their adoption of an individualized printed newspaper. The results generated are threefold: First, it is shown that there is a significant direct influence of base category consumption frequency and need satisfaction on the behavioral intention to adopt. The more frequently a subject consumes products out of the base category or the more satisfied his or her needs are due to this consumption, the higher the behavioral intention to adopt a mass-customized product within this base category. Second, the article provides an indication that base category consumption frequency has a significant moderating effect when investigating the behavioral intention to adopt in the context of the theory of reasoned action and the technology acceptance model. The more frequently a subject consumes products out of the base category, the more important will be the impact of perceived ease of use mediated by perceived usefulness. Finally, this article shows that different latent classes with respect to unobserved heterogeneity regarding the latent variables base category need satisfaction or dissatisfaction have significantly different adoption behaviors. Individuals who show a high level of need dissatisfaction are less interested in the ease of use of a mass-customized product than its usefulness (i.e., increase in need satisfaction). On the other hand, subjects who have a high degree of base category need satisfaction base their adoption decision mainly on the ease of use of the mass-customized product. These results are of managerial relevance regarding the prediction of market reactions and the understanding of the strategic use of product-line extensions based on mass-customized products. This work provides an indication that base category consumption frequency and need satisfaction positively influence the behavioral intention to adopt a mass-customized product. Hence, mass customization can be seen as one way to deepen the relationship with existing clients.","['nanSTRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY', 'USER ACCEPTANCE', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'TOOLKITS', 'TRUST', 'HETEROGENEITY', 'COMMITMENT', 'INNOVATION', 'DESIGN']",['heterogeneity'],customers frequency satisfaction
"The purpose of this paper is to define and explain the front end of product innovation as a discrete segment of development between research and product development. The Valley of Death is used as a metaphor to describe the relative lack of resources and expertise in this area of development. The metaphor suggests that there are relative more resources on one side of the valley in the form of research expertise and on the other side by commercialization expertise and resources. Within this valley a set of interlocking roles are examined that move projects from one side to the other. The empirical methodology used in this study gathered data from 272 Product Development & Management Association (PDMA) members with extensive experience in the front end of product development using a Web-based survey instrument. Extensive pretests with experienced practitioners were conducted to develop the instrument. Results indicate that significant development takes place before projects enter into a firm's formal product development process. The data also support the roles of champion, sponsor, and gatekeeper as major actors that work together to develop and promote projects for introduction into the formal process. Champions make the organization aware of opportunities by conceptualizing the idea and preparing business cases. Sponsors support the development of promising ideas by providing resources to demonstrate the project's viability. Gatekeepers set criteria and make acceptance decisions. The data also reveal a dynamic interdependence between role players. It is concluded that the Valley of Death is a productive tool for identifying and understanding a critical area of development that has not been adequately addressed. This research finds a dynamic interplay between roles to accomplish tasks that are not well understood in practice or the literature. The implications of this research are far-ranging. It suggests that companies must understand the challenges in the valley, must develop the skills, and must make resources available to master the front end of product innovation. Recognizing roles, providing resources, and establishing expectations and accountability in this area of development become manageable in light of these results. Theoretically, this research informs role theory of a dynamic set of relationships previously treated as static. It also empirically investigates an area of product development where there is limited data. This paper opens profitable inquiries by focusing on an area of development not adequately researched yet drives the activities and investment made in subsequent steps of product development.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'FUZZY FRONT-END', 'SINGLE-ITEM', 'BUSINESS INCUBATORS', 'MULTIPLE-ITEM', 'COMMUNICATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'CHAMPIONS', 'BOUNDARY', 'BEHAVIOR']",['champions'],innovation
"This paper examines whether organizations with different collectivized agency arrangements have different survival prospects. We propose that the structure of monitoring and incentive systems determines the agency costs of collectivized agencies and, in turn, their vulnerability to competition and environmental variability. The paper focuses on mutual and stock savings and loan associations (SLAs) and, notes that stock SLAs have superior monitoring, incentive systems, and capital structures in comparison with mutual SLAs. An analysis of 900 SLAs founded during 1960-1987 indicates that mutual companies were more vulnerable than stock companies to competition from commercial banks, but there was no conclusive evidence that mutuals were more susceptible to environmental variability than stocks were. The results also show that deregulation sharply attenuated the agency advantages of stocks, implying that agency-cost advantages may be constrained by institutional processes.","['nanOWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'FIRM', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'COSTS']","['organizations', 'costs']",savings loan associations
"Key account management (KAM) is a rapidly growing area of interest in business-to-business marketing. However unnoticed by marketing, a quiet revolution has taken place in supply chain management (SCM), where the traditional emphasis on least-cost transactions has given way to a focus on long-term relationships with a few key suppliers. It is thus apparent that the two disciplines are converging. This article uses a cross-disciplinary approach to explore whether these developments from the field of SCM provide insights into key business-to-business relationships. A detailed case study of a long-term relationship between a business-to-business services provider and a key customer in the construction industry suggests there is a definable overlap. The supply chain model illuminates five important elements of KAM and offers a promising method for the evaluation of such relationships. As a result of the research, both supplier and customer companies implemented actions to improve and strengthen this important relationship.","['business-to-business services', 'supply chain management', 'key account management', 'collaborationnan']","['business to business services', 'business to business services', 'business to business services', 'business to business services', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'key account management', 'key account management', 'key account management']",key account management business marketing supply chain management construction industry
"This paper examines the relationship between purpose and purposeful organizing and how such arrangements influence the entrepreneurial journey as sustainable ventures move from idea to markets. We leverage an iterative multi-stage process-tracing design to understand the mechanisms whereby 14 different B Corp certified organizations embed purpose before, during and after the certification process. Our analyses reveal three types of venture paths for purpose-driven entrepreneurs, which are shaped by distinct imprinting sequences with three critical sensitive windows playing a pivotal role: the definition of scope of purpose, timing of purpose formalization through B Corp Certification and shifts in the source of feedback. Different imprinter; occurring within the critical sensitive windows shape particular imprinting sequences triggering situations of both productive and counterproductive path development. Our results challenge the assumed linear relationship between purpose and purposeful organizing and more specifically the belief that seeking (purposeful) B Corp certification at firm foundation is necessarily productive for society and for the ventures themselves regardless of when the certification is achieved.","['Purpose', 'Sustainable entrepreneurship', 'B Corps', 'Imprinting', 'Sensitive windows', 'Process-tracing researchHYBRID ORGANIZATIONS', 'SOCIAL ENTERPRISES', 'IMPACT']","['purpose', 'imprinting', 'sensitive windows', 'sensitive windows']",process tracing certification purpose driven entrepreneurs imprinting certification
"This paper addresses theoretical gaps in the relationships among decision maker agreement, social context, and performance. Agreement is considered a multidimensional construct that is embedded in a social context of intergroup relationships. Four dimensions of agreement are specified: (1) perceived agreement, (2) actual agreement, (3) accuracy, and (4) agreement with one's own organization. Understood this way, agreement is associated with success expectations. Empirical tests of hypotheses derived from this view are based on data concerning agreement on acquisition goals by the top management teams from two hospitals in the year following an acquisition. Results support a multidimensional view of agreement, the importance of the intergroup context, and the association of agreement and expectations for success.","['AGREEMENT', 'ACQUISITIONS', 'INTERGROUP', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'HOSPITALSSTRATEGY FORMULATION', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY', 'CONSENSUS', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'NETWORKS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'OUTCOMES', 'MERGERS']","['agreement', 'intergroup']",performance
"Based on the social capital, conflict, and ethics literatures, this study introduces a new concept, the family point of view, and provides theoretical arguments resulting in the following hypotheses: (a) The family point of view emerges from collaborative dialogue, which helps develop agreement to ethical norms; (b) the presence of ethical norms further helps cultivate family social capital; and (c) as a resource in a family business, family social capital is positively related to family firm performance. Using structural equation modeling, an exploratory test of 405 small family firms found support for all three hypotheses. The findings indicate a fully mediated relationship among collaborative dialogue, ethical norms, family social capital, and firm performance. The study not only highlights the importance of moral infrastructure in family firms but also helps clarify components of family social capital.","['ethics', 'social capital', 'dialogue', 'collaboration', 'morality', 'family enterpriseUNIFIED SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE', 'OWNERSHIP', 'BUSINESS']","['ethics', 'social capital', 'social capital', 'dialogue', 'business']",conflict business
"Acquisitions often occur in waves within industries. We extend the theoretical understanding of such waves by drawing upon research on early mover advantage and bandwagon effects to develop arguments regarding the likely performance potential of participating at different points in an acquisition wave. In line with our theoretical model, we find acquisition performance is higher for early movers but lower for acquirers that participate at the height of the acquisition wave. Although we find this general performance trend, our findings suggest both industry and acquirer characteristics influence the degree to which firms seize early mover advantages or fall prey to bandwagon pressures.","['nanCORPORATE TAKEOVER BIDS', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'STOCK RETURNS', '1ST-MOVER', 'IMPACT', 'EXPERIENCE', 'FIRMS', 'INFORMATION', 'STRATEGIES', 'RESOURCES']",['firms'],performance model
"Research Summary: This article examines the adaptation process of a large manufacturer in the Indian steel industry faced with radical sociopolitical shifts in the external ecosystem. It uses the Bower-Burgelman process model in combination with Bourdieu's praxis theory to explain the emergence of competing managerial initiatives and associated contests in the company's internal ecology of strategy-making in terms of socially acquired dispositions. It illuminates process-practice pathways through which top management's resource allocation supported changes in the efficacy of the different forms of capital of the contesting managerial classes, thereby legitimizing the daily doings of the rising class and institutionalizing a (re)defined adaptive rule structure. Managerial Summary: How do managers' early influences, including family upbringing and schooling, bear upon organization's renewal strategy? Our study finds that during discontinuities imposed by socioeconomic upheavals, when organizational performance flounders, managerial initiatives are driven by deepest dispositions derived from early age socialization. Competing managerial fractions jostle to impose practices favorable to their longstanding preferences by putting their weight behind preferred product-market choices and seeking appropriate changes in the ineffective internal rule structure. Administration's challenge lies in leveraging internal contests to iteratively allocate resources in search of winning dispositions and configurations aligned with evolving social relations in the external environment. Internal availability of managerial groups from diverse social origins is crucial for the administration to reclaim organizational advantage by arbitrating between contesting practices and practitioner fortunes.","[""Bourdieu's practice theory"", 'Bower-Burgelman process framework', 'habitus', 'organizational renewal', 'resource allocationECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'MODEL', 'INDIA', 'RISE']","['model', 'india']",model performance
"Entrepreneurial team scholars highlight the importance of studying entrepreneurial team cognition in gaining a better understanding of why some entrepreneurial teams are capable of developing teamwork leading to successful entrepreneurial outcomes while others are not. However, in the absence of a clear definition of entrepreneurial team cognition, researchers continue to employ a vast diversity of potentially related concepts. To bring clarity to this fragmented area of research, the authors performed a systematic literature review of papers concerned with entrepreneurial team cognition published in the leading management and entrepreneurship journals over the past 20 years. This review was guided by two main research questions: (a) what is entrepreneurial team cognition, and (b) how does entrepreneurial team cognition interact with inputs, processes and outcomes. Based on the published literature, key properties of the concept are identified, and an overarching definition of entrepreneurial team cognition composed of these properties is introduced. Next, the review outlines how entrepreneurial team cognition interacts with other variables within a comprehensive input-mediator-output framework. Finally, the review addresses how future research can build on the proposed definition and framework to advance the theoretical depth and empirical investigation of entrepreneurial team cognition.","['nanTOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS', 'STRATEGIC DECISION-PROCESSES', 'SHARED MENTAL MODELS', 'OF-THE-LITERATURE', 'FOUNDING TEAMS', 'VENTURE PERFORMANCE', 'START-UPS', 'FRAMEWORK', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'NETWORKS']",['framework'],team entrepreneurial team review investigation
"Research summary: In this paper we adopt a core-periphery approach to specify the direct and indirect effects of social capital on organizational performance. We suggest that social capital deriving from stable task relationships between organizational members has a direct positive effect on organizational performance. Said effect depends, in both strength and functional form, on whether actors involved in stable dyads are located at the core or at the periphery of the organization. We also argue that core and peripheral social capital affect performance indirectly by moderating the organization's ability to leverage its human capital to improve performance. Results from a 48-year study of the National Basketball Association support our arguments and bear important implications for strategic human resource practices and organizational performance in competitive settings.Managerial summary: Stable work relationships among employees generate trust, more efficient work routines, common understanding and thus higher organizational performance. These benefits depend on the location of such stable relationships in the organization. Relational stability among core organizational members has an immediate, strong impact on performance, an effect that plateaus as stability grows. Stable relationships between core and peripheral members have instead a weaker, yet linear effect on performance. The location of stable relationships is also critical to leverage the talent of core employees, whose contribution to performance is stronger when relational stability is high in the organizational core, yet hindered by stable relations between core and periphery. Such findings provide relevant implications for strategic human resource management, in particular for choices regarding team composition and managing stars.

"This article documents a bias in people's causal inferences, showing that people nonnormatively consider an event's consequences when inferring its causes. Across experiments, participants' inferences about event causes were systematically affected by how similar (in both size and valence) those causes were to event consequences, even when the consequences were objectively uninformative about the causes. For example, people inferred that a product failure (computer crash) had a large cause (widespread computer virus) if it had a large consequence (job loss) but that the identical failure was more likely to have a smaller cause (cooling fan malfunction) if the consequence was small-even though the consequences gave no new information about what caused the crash. This consequence-cause matching, which can affect product attitudes, may arise because people are motivated to see the world as predictable and because matching is an accessible schema that helps them to fulfill this motivation.","['nanCOMPENSATORY CONTROL', 'ATTRIBUTION PROCESS', 'ATTITUDE FUNCTIONS', 'CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR', 'PERCEPTION', 'MAGNITUDE', 'VICTIM', 'REPRESENTATIVENESS', 'RESPONSIBILITY', 'INFORMATION']",['information'],inferences motivation
"Over the past few decades, cross-border business has experienced unparalleled growth. This growth is due to advances in communication and information technologies, privatization and deregulation in emerging economies, and emergence of the global consumer As the era of globalization continues to manifest through the emergence of global companies, the importance of customer relationship management (CRM) in these companies has become increasingly significant. Global CRM (GCRM) is the strategic application of the processes and practices of CRM by firms operating in multiple countries or by firms serving customers who span multiple countries, which incorporates relevant differences in business practices, competition, regulatory characteristics, country characteristics, and consumer characteristics to CRM strategies to maximize customer value across the global customer portfolio of the firm. In this article, the authors present an overview of the GCRM environment and the challenges in formulation and implementation of CRM across national boundaries as a source of sustained advantage.

"De-globalization, now a distinct possibility, would induce a significant qualitative shift in strategies, structures, and behaviors observable in international business (IB). Coming to terms with this qualitative shift would require IB research to develop a much deeper integration of politics, the key driver of de-globalization. To support such integration, this paper introduces two relevant theories of (de-)globalization from political science, liberalism and realism. Both predict de-globalization under current conditions but lead to different expectations about the future world economy: liberalism suggests a patchwork of economic linkages, while realism predicts the emergence of economic blocs around major countries. This paper discusses the resulting opportunities in three areas of IB research: political strategies and roles of multinational enterprises (MNEs), global value chains, and the role of the national context. For political strategies and roles, there is a need to explore how regular business activities and deliberate political agency of MNEs affect the political sustainability of globalization. For value chains, questions include their future reach and specialization, changes in organizational forms, and the impact of political considerations on location decisions. Research opportunities on national contexts relate to their ability to sustain globalization and their connection with economic and military power.","['globalization', 'internationalization theory', 'international relations and political science', 'political backlash', 'global institutions', 'trade blocs', 'political strategies', 'global supply chain strategies', 'institutional contextFOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'WORLD', 'INTEGRATION', 'CAPITALISM', 'COEVOLUTION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGIES', 'FRAMEWORK', 'POWER', 'MNES']","['globalization', 'political strategies', 'political strategies', 'world', 'integration', 'strategies', 'power', 'mnes']",realism value chains
"Research Summary This paper examines how incumbent firms' market positions and interdependencies across their submarkets influence their responses to entry threats. We adapt a model of capacity deterrence to show that because premium and low-cost incumbents face different demand functions and operating costs, they experience different tradeoffs between ignoring, deterring, and accommodating threatened entry. In addition, the interdependencies within and between a premium incumbent's submarkets influence its responses. Using data on incumbent responses to entry threats from Southwest Airlines between 2003 and 2012, we find that (a) full-service incumbents expanded capacity while low-cost incumbents did not respond significantly, and (b) full-service incumbents expanded capacity less aggressively in submarkets that had less substitutable customer segments and submarkets that were more complementary with their unthreatened submarkets. Managerial Summary An immutable market position is a core competitive advantage. Using data on incumbent responses to entry threats from Southwest Airlines between 2003 and 2012, we find that (a) full-service (FSC) incumbents expanded capacity while low-cost (LCC) incumbents did not respond significantly, and (b) FSCs expanded capacity less aggressively on routes that were expected to have a large number of business passengers and routes that connected to their international hubs. These results suggest two sources of positional immutability: While one set of past choices (e.g., those about submarket substitutability or complementarity) provide a barrier against imitation, another set of past choices (e.g., those about products and costs) generate incentives for a tough defense, both deterring entry by firms from a different position.","['airlines', 'competitive interaction', 'entry deterrence', 'interdependence', 'market positionMULTIMARKET CONTACT', 'INVESTMENT', 'DETERRENCE', 'CAPACITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'INFORMATION', 'COMPETITION', 'DYNAMICS']","['airlines', 'deterrence', 'capacity']",submarkets responses entry threats deterrence southwest airlines
"Supplier perspective taking, whereby an internal customer adopts the perspective of an internal supplier, was investigated. Two dimensions were assessed: positive attributions and empathy. Supplier perspective taking was associated with team leader ratings of employees' contextual performance. Production ownership and integrated understanding predicted supplier perspective taking and were in turn predicted by job autonomy. Interaction with suppliers contributed to supplier perspective taking directly and indirectly. These findings suggest two ways to enhance supplier perspective taking and hence contextual performance: increase employee interaction with suppliers and enrich job content.","['nanTURNING OBSERVERS', 'HELPING-BEHAVIOR', 'EMPATHY', 'WORK', 'ATTRIBUTION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL']","['empathy', 'attribution', 'performance']",attributions
"The authors proposed and tested a model linking service-employee attrition, customer-perceived service outcomes, and financial performance utilizing time-lagged data obtained from 64 business units of a temporary help services (staffing) firm. Using the notion of relational assets, the authors predicted that employee attrition (both voluntary turnover and downsizing) would disrupt the existing stock of relationships between customer-facing employees and their customers, which would have negative effects on customer outcomes and future financial performance of business units. The authors found that (a) the relationship between voluntary turnover and customer-perceived service brand image (SBI) was fully mediated by customers' evaluations of service delivery, (b) the relationship between downsizing and SBI was fully mediated by the customer orientation levels of the unit staff, and (c) SBI significantly predicted future unit profitability. These findings point to critical factors that leaders must address when experiencing elevated levels of turnover or considering downsizing. These include focusing on developing customer orientation levels among employees through the effective use of selection, training, performance management, and compensation, minimizing employee voluntary turnover by creating positive work environments, and factoring in the long-term costs of downsizing on the organization's SBI and future profitability.","['employee turnover', 'service brands', 'customer orientationORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'VOLUNTARY TURNOVER', 'BRAND TRUST', 'UNIT', 'TIME', 'SATISFACTION', 'ORIENTATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'PERCEPTIONS']","['voluntary turnover', 'voluntary turnover', 'unit', 'time', 'orientation']",model voluntary turnover downsizing brand image customer orientation
"The concept of complementarity denotes the beneficial interplay of the elements of a system where the presence of one element increases the value of others. However, the conceptual work on complementarities to date has not progressed sufficiently to constitute a theory that would offer specific predictions regarding the nature of the elements that form complementary relationships or the conditions for their emergence. To advance our understanding of complementarities, the authors provide a synoptic review of the empirical studies on this concept in leading journals in management, economics, and related disciplines over the period 1988-2008. The authors find that whether a study provides evidence of complementarities in organizations is at least partially driven by its investigative approach. On the basis of the findings, the authors argue that complementarities are most likely to materialize among multiple, heterogeneous factors in complex systems. Therefore, the absence of complementary relationships between a limited set of individual factors may not negate the possibility of complementarities, but rather point to the need for including further systems-specific factors in the analysis. The authors conclude by providing directions for future theoretical and empirical research and outlining managerial implications of the work.","['complementarities', 'organizational designRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'RESOURCE MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES', 'INFORMATION-SYSTEMS RESOURCES', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT', 'INCUMBENTS ADVANTAGE', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'INNOVATION', 'KNOWLEDGE']",['complementarities'],
"Many Internet applications do not fully utilize the unique nature of the Web, which in its purest Form involves interactive, personalized information service. The true nature of the Web, here termed e-service, will be the key to marketing most effectively to the consumer, for it is the logical continuation of a 100-year trend toward information service in the economy. This paper examines the aspects of e-service that are critical in effectively interacting with consumers in interactive, networked information environments like the Internet. It discusses three central changes brought about by the advent of the Internet (true interactivity with the consumer, customer-specific, situational personalization, and the opportunity for real-time adjustments to a Firm's offering to customers), as well os changes in consumer expectations regarding firm service strategies that Flow from these developments. Based upon these changes in technology and consumer expectations, important elements of the e-service experience are defined. The paper concludes by showing how e-service strategies will ploy a significant role in growing the overall value of the firm. In each of these areas, a set of research questions is proposed that will lead to a stronger understanding of e-service! and consumer behavior.","['e-service', 'personalization', 'self-serviceSATISFACTION', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'EXPERIENCE']","['e service', 'e service', 'personalization', 'environments', 'experience']",

"Research summary: Using a unique database that measures firm-level bribery in Africa and Latin America, we corroborate extant results in the literature that paying bribes deters firm investments in fixed assets. Our contribution is to explore four mechanisms. By adopting a reverse causality approach (Gelman and Imbens, 2013), we find evidence consistent with one of them: short-term oriented firms prefer to bribe rather than invest in fixed assets, while the opposite is true for firms with a long-term orientation. We rule out that bribe payments drain financial resources for investment, that firms that invest do not bribe because fixed assets make them less flexible and more vulnerable to future bribes, and that less efficient firms bribe rather than invest.Managerial summary: We ask whether, along with ethical issues, bribing affects the behavior and performance of firms in Africa and Latin America. Our statistical analysis shows that bribe payments do not reduce the short-term performance of firms, but frustrate investments in fixed assets, which is the foundation of firms' long-term growth. It is like seeking a job via nepotism or education. Nepotism makes it likely to find a job in the short term. However, the solid skills generated by education raise the odds of finding better jobs in the future. We rule out some common explanations for the trade-off between bribing and investment (e.g., bribes drain resources to invest or that less efficient firms bribe and do not invest). Our analysis suggests that firms with short-term orientations are more likely to bribe and firms with long-term orientation are more likely to invest.

To investigate this challenge, we explored the nature, dynamics, and impacts of contrasting project management styles. Our conceptual framework details emergent and planned styles. Following 80 projects over two-year periods, we find that these styles offer disparate but interwoven approaches to monitoring, evaluation, and control activities; use of these activities fluctuates over time; a paradoxical blend of styles enhances performance; and uncertainty moderates project management-performance relationships.","['nanENVIRONMENTAL UNCERTAINTY', 'CONTINGENCY THEORY', 'IMPROVISATION', 'INNOVATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'JAZZ']","['innovation', 'performance']",innovation
"Individual benefits to those who have been mentored are well documented. The present study demonstrates that organization-level mentoring relates to overall organizational performance. In a study of 589 employees of 39 substance abuse treatment agencies, the authors found that agencies with a greater proportion of mentored employees also reported greater overall agency performance. Organization-level mentoring also related to organization-level job satisfaction, organization-level organizational citizenship behavior, and organization-level learning.

"Despite widespread and growing public interest in sustainability certifications, many social entrepreneurs have opted not to obtain such certification. Drawing on recent studies highlighting the salience of both gender and context in shaping differences among social enterprises, we develop an identity-based framework for explaining heterogeneity in the adoption of sustainability certification. We test our ideas using a sample of 1251 U.S. firms obtained from B lab, the organization responsible for assessing Certified B Corporations. Our results show that woman-owned businesses are twice as likely to qualify for certification and more than three times as likely to certify. Moreover, this propensity to certify is amplified in contexts where sustainability norms are weak, mimetic pressure to obtain sustainability certification is low, and woman-owned businesses are less prevalent. These findings support our central theoretical argument that certification differences are due to actors' efforts to engage in identity work, strengthening their sense of self-coherence and distinctiveness by way of this authentication process. We conclude by highlighting our contributions to existing scholarship on social entrepreneurship, identity work, and certification adoption, as well as strategic implications for B Lab.","['Social entrepreneurship', 'B Corporations', 'Women entrepreneurs', 'Identity work', 'Sustainability', 'CertificationSAMPLE SELECTION BIAS', 'SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'PROBIT MODELS', 'GENDER', 'MANAGEMENT', 'DISTINCTIVENESS', 'INDUSTRY', 'VALUES', 'INSTITUTIONALIZATION', 'STANDARD']","['social entrepreneurship', 'social entrepreneurship', 'b corporations', 'b corporations', 'identity work', 'identity work', 'sustainability', 'social entrepreneurship', 'social entrepreneurship', 'gender', 'distinctiveness']",sustainability certifications identity firms identity work self social entrepreneurship

"Primarily on the basis of research from noncompetitive settings, it is generally believed that nonsubstantive advertising features are ineffective when consumers engage in issue-relevant thinking. Experiment 1 of the current study replicated prior research. Neither spokesperson fame nor the vividness of advertising copy influenced attitudes in noncompetitive settings. However, these same features proved effective in the context of balanced competition. When brands were homogenous (experiment 2) or characterized by large price-quality trade-offs (experiment 3), nonsubstantive features improved attitudes and choice probabilities despite issue-relevant thinking. When trade-offs were small, however, nonsubstantive features were again ineffective. The results suggest that balanced competition can neutralize the effects of substantive features, increase indecision, and promote perceptual contrast. These effects then empower nonsubstantive features to serve as heuristics and/or reduce the risk of postpreference regret.","['nanCHOICE', 'PERSUASION', 'ALTERNATIVES', 'INFORMATION', 'FAMILIARITY', 'STRATEGIES', 'JUDGMENTS', 'DECISION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'FEATURES']","['decision', 'features']",brands price choice
"Performance factors of small Israeli tourism ventures were examined using an integrated model that combines four theoretical approaches, each focusing on a different central facet: environmental milieu institutional support, entrepreneurial human capital, and the venture's bundle of services. The current research developed an operational instrument for assessing environmental attractiveness components of tourism ventures and their relationship to performance. A factor analysis, based on this instrument, revealed three environmental factors: tourist-related infrastructure, options for excursions and scenery, including climate. An attractive environment contributed to higher revenues in tourism ventures; however, it did not assure profitability. The results indicate the dual nature of the impact of institutional support upon the tourism venture's performance. Regardless of the size and age of ventures, those obtaining the advisory type of assistance from the governmental tourism incubator performed less well than those ventures that did not obtain such support By contrast, those tourism ventures that were financially supported by external sources performed better than those that were not financially supported. The explanation for this curious and seemingly contradictory finding may lie in the different criteria for receiving financial and advisory assistance. Success in persuading external sources to provide financial support would seem to be evidence of the soundness of the venture's planning and its economic viability. By contrast, insofar as virtually any venture in the area may apply for and obtain advisory assistance from the governmental tourism incubator, with no requirement to meet financial criteria of any kind, it could be that precisely the weaker ventures are being carried along by this form of assistance Among the various entrepreneur's attributes examined managerial skills provided the strongest association with the performance measures. The managerial skills were also found to be the most significant variable explaining performance relatively to the variables derived from the other three approaches. These results have implications regarding the nature of the support to be given by a governmental tourism incubator to entrepreneurs operating in the region. Given that lack of managerial skills is one of the main barriers to a venture's success, particularly in small businesses where the owners have to be involved in all areas of activity, the incubator needs to provide entrepreneurs with tailored regional business and management training tools to promote tourism venture development and success. The study also reveals that the number of services offered by a tourism venture made only a minor contribution in the revenues regression, which may indicate that providing a bundle of services for the tourist customer does nor necessarily guarantee profitability. A noteworthy finding is the similarity in the differential association between the number of services offered and the performance measures on the one hand, and attractiveness features with performance on the other. In both cases, these factors positively contribute to the revenues regression, brit neither contributes to the profitability or income regression. This means that an attractive environment does contribute to higher revenues, in thar more tourists choose to visit the tourist attractions; however, this does nor assure profitability. Similarly, providing many services to the visitors may also contribute to higher revenues, but does not necessarily assure profitable business outcomes. The current findings indicate that small tourism venture profitability is contingent on human capital, especially the skills of the entrepreneurs running the venture. In accordance with our findings that managerial skills are so crucial for venture success, the main objective of advisory incubators should be to promote managerial competencies.

"Purpose There is a consensus suggesting that the theoretical underpinning associated with supply chain quality management practices remain evolutionary to current thinking. Therefore, this study aims to explore how absorptive capacity (AC) supports supply chain quality integration (SCQI) by building product and process quality within a supply chain (SC). Design/methodology/approach A comparative case study of global pharmaceutical manufacturers in a developing market was undertaken. A two-round qualitative research method was designed to collect data through 54 semi-structured interviews with pharmaceutical managers and senior managers. Findings The results demonstrate that AC is essential to the development of SCQI because of its ability to use valuable strategic and operational knowledge, which is important when improving consistent internal product and process quality, along with establishing a robust SC design. The authors found that AC enables companies to design their quality and continuously improve their products and processes among their SC members. Research limitations/implications - The authors acknowledge that these sets of findings are difficult to generalise to other sectors, however, the authors are confident that they can be extrapolated to other companies in the pharmaceutical industry. Practical implications - The study develops a framework to support practitioners and decision makers to leverage their AC towards facilitating their SCQI practices. Originality/value This study explains the role of the AC process in relation to SCQI practices, in the context of the pharmaceutical SC. The study profiles the characteristics of dynamic capabilities to increase the companies' competencies, processes and resources.","['Case studies', 'Developing countries', 'Quality management', 'Supply-chain management', 'Pharmaceuticals', 'Supply chain quality', 'Absorptive capacity', 'Dynamic capabilityFIRM PERFORMANCE', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES', 'KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER', 'IMPACT', 'INNOVATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'LOGISTICS']","['quality management', 'quality management', 'supply chain quality', 'supply chain quality', 'supply chain quality', 'absorptive capacity', 'absorptive capacity', 'dynamic capabilities', 'dynamic capabilities', 'management practices', 'management practices']",quality management absorptive capacity supply chain quality integration
"Drawing from the organizational behaviour and services marketing literature, we develop a conceptual model of self-managing team (SMT) service climate, taking into account characteristics of the organizational context, the SMT, and the individual employee. In order to assess the impact of SMT service climate, we include a number of internal consequences (i. e., in-company performance data) and external service performance outcomes (i.e., customer-perceived service quality). As a result of the hierarchically nested data-structure (i. e., groups and individuals), we investigate the antecedents of SMT service climate in service groups using a multi-level approach. Our results reveal that organizational and group factors have a significant cross-level influence on individual employee perceptions of SMT service climate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that employee perceptions of SMT service climate are positively related to customer-perceived service quality, while there is no relationship with service productivity measures..","['nanWORK GROUP CHARACTERISTICS', 'CROSS-LEVEL EXAMINATION', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'QUALITY', 'EMPLOYEE', 'EMPOWERMENT', 'MANAGEMENT', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'DESIGN']","['quality', 'employee', 'antecedents']",impact customer perceived service quality
"Open innovation contests are a popular way to tap into the creativity of customers. Many firms host multiple, successive open innovation contests in response to different, creative challenges they face. To encourage customers to participate and make an effort in such contests, they offer monetary rewards of varying sizes. Although prior research has investigated the optimal reward design for one-time contests, little is known about how the rewards offered in a contest can influence individuals' ongoing level of participation and their creative effort in subsequent contests. Receiving a reward is a form of positive competence feedback that influences individuals' feelings of competence and intrinsic motivation. Based on cognitive evaluation theory, we argue that these feelings can persist after a contest ends, influencing positively participation and creative efforts in later contests. Our online experiment and also our analysis of the data from an actual open innovation platform show that individuals tend to cease participating in subsequent contests, significantly reducing the size of the crowd over time. Receiving a reward and positive competence feedback alleviates this tendency. Therefore, offering more prizes motivates more high-performing individuals to participate again and to put in more creative effort, which in turn raise the average quality as well as the best quality in subsequent contests. These findings suggest that in successive open innovation contests, multiple rewards not only encourage greater participation, but also promote better quality outcomes. Thus, firms are well advised to expand the positive reward feedback in contests, as doing so will help them to maintain a sizable and motivated crowd of contestants.","['nanCOGNITIVE EVALUATION THEORY', 'INTRINSIC MOTIVATION', 'CONTINGENT REWARDS', 'OPTIMAL ALLOCATION', 'GENERATION TASK', 'PRODUCT IDEAS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TOURNAMENTS', 'CREATIVITY', 'PARTICIPATION']","['intrinsic motivation', 'intrinsic motivation', 'creativity', 'participation']",creativity competence
"Existing strategic group studies have rarely examined ownership type as a variable to classify firms in an industry. Using Chinese firms of different ownership types, we suggest that ownership type can be a parsimonious and important variable that managers use to cognitively classify firms into different strategic groups. While ownership itself is an objective variable, we contend that different ownership types lead to different managerial outlook and mentality due to a number of macro and micro foundations giving rise to various managerial cognitions. Employing the Miles and Snow typology, we find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and privately-owned enterprises (POEs) tend to adopt defender and prospector strategies, respectively, while collectively-owned enterprises (COEs) and foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) exhibit an analyser orientation that falls between defenders and prospectors on the strategy continuum. Three statistical tests suggest that ownership types can be used to successfully predict strategic group memberships in China's emerging economy.","['nanCORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'TRANSITION ECONOMY', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'CHINA', 'PRIVATIZATION', 'MARKET', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'ENTREPRENEURS', 'PERSPECTIVE']",['china'],ownership mentality miles
"Lean In has started a worldwide conversation about the representation of women in senior leadership roles. However, the conversation has focused on individual factors that could assist women in their leadership journeys. In this paper, we draw on research about gender stereotypes in three streams (think manager-think male, the glass cliff, and childcare) to argue that the who, what, and when of leaning in as presented in this book are problematic. Our synthesis of the literature leads us to conclude that gender stereotypes form subtle systemic barriers to the advancement of significant numbers of women into these roles at the group level. To circumvent these stereotypes, increasing the representation of women in senior leadership roles is a necessary first step, not an eventual outcome. We illustrate our point with an example from the Canadian federal government. To change the numbers of women in top leadership roles, individuals in powerful positions in organizations (mainly men) need to make the proportional representation of women in senior leadership roles a priority-one that is enforced through measurement, tracking, and reinforcement.","['nanREQUISITE MANAGEMENT CHARACTERISTICS', 'SEX-ROLE STEREOTYPES', 'GENDER-ROLE STEREOTYPES', 'GLASS CLIFF', 'THINK-MANAGER', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'WOMEN', 'LEADERSHIP', 'FEMALE', 'EMPLOYMENT']","['glass cliff', 'glass cliff', 'think manager', 'think manager', 'women', 'leadership']",gender

"As traditional sources of competitive advantage shrink, firms seek new ones. One such source of competitive advantage is product design because of its effects on customer experience. To understand the role and impact of product design on customer experience, we propose an integrated, customer-based framework for product design that we call the total product design concept (TPDC). We define a product's TPDC as consisting of three elements, namely functionality, aesthetics, and meaning, each of which arises from more elemental product characteristics. We elaborate on the structure of a product's TPDC, its three elements, and the links between those elements and customers' experience with a product. We provide an illustrative application of the TPDC using data from the U.S. auto market. The findings from that application support the proposed three-dimensional view of the TPDC, and demonstrate heterogeneity both in the TPDC's structure and its effects on customer satisfaction. For all three segments, functionality enhances customer satisfaction. For the largest segment of customers, functionality is the most important factor, followed by aesthetics. For the other two segments, customer satisfaction is most influenced by the meaning element of TPDC. We discuss the implications of these findings for the auto industry in particular, and the potential use of the TPDC more generally.","['nanSTRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'INDUSTRIAL-DESIGN', 'AESTHETICS', 'DECISIONS', 'CONSUMERS', 'ROLES', 'FORM']",['aesthetics'],design experience functionality customer
"Several measures and methods developed by the field of cognitive science may prove useful to researchers investigating various aspects of entrepreneurial cognition. These techniques include ones that have not, as yet, been applied to entrepreneurial cognition, such as reaction time, priming, measures of working memory, and measures of creative cognition. Because the questions addressed by any field are shaped, to an important degree, by the tools at its disposal, incorporating these measures into the study of entrepreneurial cognition may help to broaden the scope of this ongoing work. Specifically, these techniques may provide researchers with tools useful in exploring issues that have not previously been investigated in detail (e.g., the nature of entrepreneurs' knowledge structures; their characteristic modes of thought). This, in turn, may enhance our understanding of the cognitive factors that influence key aspects of the entrepreneurial process.","['nanSTRUCTURED IMAGINATION', 'CATEGORY STRUCTURE', 'VENTURE FORMATION', 'PRIOR KNOWLEDGE', 'WORKING-MEMORY', 'BASIC LEVEL', 'EXPERTISE', 'CREATIVITY', 'EMERGENCE', 'EXAMPLES']","['working memory', 'working memory']",memory knowledge

"Export performance models anchored in the industrial organization and resource-based theories have previously been developed and tested. Thus far there have been no empirically tested export performance models that have reflected the core tenets of the relational, or behavioral, paradigm. Drawing from relational exchange theory, a model that includes reciprocal perceptions that relate to both past and future exchanges is developed. This model is tested with dyadic data from 125 West-East (Australia-Thailand) exporter-importer partnerships, reflecting the increasing importance of West-East exchange relationships. Results support the theory's contention that commitment (to future exchanges) is associated with export performance, and is itself driven by a reciprocal cycle of each partner's perception of the other's commitment, relationship-specific investments and dependence. This cycle of commitment is in turn influenced by each partner's trust in the other (from past exchanges), with different types of trust linked to different types of commitment. Trust and commitment are then found to be related both to interpersonal factors (i.e., effective communication, cultural sensitivity and likeability of partner) and to firm factors (reputation and competencies of partner).","['export performance', 'relationship marketing', 'trust', 'commitmentCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'EXECUTIVE INSIGHTS', 'TRUST', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'COMMITMENT', 'GOVERNANCE', 'DETERMINANTS', 'FIRM', 'INTERNATIONALIZATION', 'SATISFACTION']","['export performance', 'export performance', 'trust', 'trust', 'commitment', 'firm']",models behavioral commitment

"This article investigates the sales force socialization process, wherein newly hired salespeople often face failure-prone environments. Drawing from the learned helplessness paradigm, the authors hypothesize that cumulative periods of sales performance failure are associated with sales-oriented behavior intentions. In addition, the authors examine the influence of leadership, expecting core transformational leadership to have a diminishing effect as unmet sales goals accumulate. Study 1 finds support for these hypotheses using panel survey data from 221 new hires during six months of a furniture retailer's sales force socialization process. Then, aiming to uncover the underlying mechanism driving salesperson helplessness and a managerial approach that has a sustained impact, the authors conduct Study 2, a scenario-based experiment focused on the business-to-business insurance industry. The authors find that perceived task difficulty mediates the focal relationship and that error management enables core transformational leadership to have a lasting effect such that new hires have the lowest sales-oriented behavior intentions when transformational sales managers encourage them to make errors during their interactions with customers and to actively learn from their failures.","['core transformational leadership', 'error management', 'sales force socialization', 'sales-oriented behaviors', 'sales performance failureCUSTOMER ORIENTATION', 'SALES', 'ATTRIBUTIONS', 'COMMITMENT', 'OUTCOMES', 'IMPACT', 'SCALE']","['core transformational leadership', 'core transformational leadership', 'core transformational leadership', 'error management', 'error management', 'sales force socialization', 'sales force socialization', 'sales force socialization', 'sales', 'impact']",helplessness behavior transformational leadership salesperson helplessness

However, compared with other IB topics, research on politics, corruption and corporate social responsibility - 'three lenses' on the MNE - remains somewhat embryonic, with unresolved issues regarding frameworks, measurement, methods, and theory. This presents unique opportunities for integration and extension of disciplinary perspectives, which we explore in this article. We provide an introduction to potential linkages across these three lenses, an agenda for additional theoretical and empirical research, and a review of the papers in the JIBS Focused Issue.","['politics', 'corruption', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate political strategies', 'business-government relations', 'business and societyFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'IMPACT', 'FIRM', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'ISSUES', 'EVENT']","['politics', 'corruption', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'issues']",multinational enterprises corruption corporate social responsibility
"At least 2,000 articles on voluntary employee turnover have been published in the past 100 years. In turn, numerous authors have reviewed the theory and research on employee turnover. Our intent with this paper is therefore not to provide a comprehensive literature review, as excellent ones are available elsewhere. Instead, the purpose of this article is to summarize major contributions in the present and provide our perspectives on the future directions of turnover research. Following a relatively terse review of the turnover literature, we elaborate on how organizational scholars can further enhance the understanding of turnover by (a) probing the turnover process with a better consideration of time, (b) studying the role of volitional control on employees' leaving/staying, (c) further investigating how the context in which employees reside influences leaving, and (d) opening up the black box of the collective turnover process.","['nanPROXIMAL WITHDRAWAL STATES', 'JOB EMBEDDEDNESS', 'UNFOLDING MODEL', 'COLLECTIVE TURNOVER', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-BEHAVIOR', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SATISFACTION', 'TIME', 'SHOCKS', 'RATES']","['collective turnover', 'collective turnover', 'time']",employee turnover
"Implementation pervades strategic performance. It is a critical link between the formulation of marketing strategies and the achievement of superior organizational performance. Research conducted in this area generally has suffered from a lack of conceptual and empirical grounding. Furthermore, implementation research often ignores the mid-level managers, who are intricately involved in most implementation activities. The authors integrate a broad literature review and a grounded theory-building process to develop a model of important factors that influence the implementation of marketing strategies from a managerial perspective. They test this model in a study of mid-level marketing managers in two different organizations. The results provide insights into the nature of implementation in marketing and suggest future research opportunities.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT', 'CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK', 'EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE', 'SALESPEOPLE', 'CONSENSUS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MECHANISMS', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'QUALITY']",['performance'],organizational performance implementation
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop understanding of the role of small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in relation to sustainable supply chain management, i.e. how corporate social responsibility (CSR) is integrated in their relationship with customers and suppliers. Design/methodology/approach-Drawing from a survey of CSR requirements among 410 Spanish SMEs, the paper examines the extent to which SMEs receive social and environmental requirements from diverse customer typologies and the extent to which they pass,on such requirements to different supplier typologies. Findings-Based on survey results, it is concluded that large businesses are the most demanding customers in terms of the CSR requirements imposed to their SME suppliers. In turn, SMEs are able to transfer the requests received from their (larger) customers to their own,suppliers. Research limitations/implications-The data are confined to companies located in a particular region (Catalonia in Spain), which questions its generalizability to other geographical contexts. Practical implications The research shows that small and medium companies can be effective in spreading the CSR requirements received from large companies through the supply chain. Originality/value-The paper contributes to research on sustainable supply chain management from the SME perspective and offers a systematic analysis of the CSR activities of SMEs, both as suppliers and buyers. In addition, it proposes a rigorous way to measure the CSR-related supply chain pressure.","['Small to medium-sized enterprises', 'Supply chain management', 'Spain', 'Corporate social responsibility', 'Sustainable supply chain management', 'Environmental and social standardsCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'ISO 14001', 'MANAGEMENT', 'DIFFUSION', 'FIRMS', 'CERTIFICATION', 'INITIATIVES', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'STANDARDS', 'FOOTWEAR']","['small to medium sized enterprises', 'small to medium sized enterprises', 'small to medium sized enterprises', 'small to medium sized enterprises', 'small to medium sized enterprises', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'spain', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'sustainable supply chain management', 'sustainable supply chain management', 'sustainable supply chain management', 'sustainable supply chain management', 'management', 'perspective']",supply chain management corporate social responsibility

In this article, we introduce this special issue of the Journal of World Business by raising the question of whether this activity is the result of the emergence of a new phenomenon or simply a new perspective on old issues. We then introduce the articles in this issue that present research, which goes beyond the traditional focus on foreign assignments and emphasizes a variety of alternative perspectives on global careers.

"When thinking about the future, people often engage in affective forecasting predicting what it would feel like to experience a particular event. In this article we explore how a specific form of work ubiquitous in today's organizations project assignments provides cause to reconsider assumptions surrounding affective forecasting. To this end, we synthesize research on affective forecasting and theorize connections between affective forecasting and project success (versus failure), rooting our arguments in the claim that affective forecasting shapes a key motivation-related aspect of performance regulatory focus. Further, we account for systematic biases underlying affective forecasting and consider how organizational factors may shape the strength of these biases. Collectively, our arguments expand and, in some respects, challenge theory on affective forecasting and open new windows into the study of affect (i.e., mood and emotion) in organizations.","['nanPERCEIVED EXTERNAL PRESTIGE', 'REGULATORY FOCUS THEORY', 'TIME-TRAVEL', 'GROUP POLARIZATION', 'DURABILITY BIAS', 'SELF-REGULATION', 'FUTURE THOUGHT', 'INTENSITY BIAS', 'EMOTION', 'PREVENTION']",['emotion'],forecasting performance regulatory focus
"In deregulated industries former monopolies often adopt asymmetric behaviors: these firms impede the entry of foreign competitors in their home market, especially using defensive political strategies, and, at the same time, aggressively develop international strategies in foreign markets. To account for this behavior, I develop a game theoretic model involving three players: the former monopoly, its home government, and the host government of the country, into which the firm wants to enter. I show first that there are in fact different asymmetric strategies that former monopolies can use in such a setting, and that a global strategy, cannot always be implemented by those firms because of cooperation issues between the two governments. I also study the conditions under which these issues can be solved and show that this can happen only when the firm develops a political strategy that integrates both defensive and offensive activities. Overall, this paper therefore argues that asymmetric strategies are not always adopted to maintain monopoly, rents but are also dictated by the nature of the international relationships between the governments involved.

"Consumers typically enjoy an experience less with repeated consumption, yet this rate of satiation can dramatically vary across contexts and individuals. Building on the notion that satiation is constructed during consumption, we demonstrate that people satiate faster when they employ a greater working memory capacity. We establish this result in four studies across multiple experienced stimuli while using a range of measures of working memory capacity. We also develop insight into the underlying cognitive mechanism using mediation and moderation to show that people utilizing a larger working memory capacity satiate faster because they more deeply encode and process each stimulus. This subsequently leads to a sense that they have consumed that stimulus more times, and hence greater satiation. This provides direct evidence that working memory capacity is a critical cognitive mechanism underlying satiation, and it helps us potentially understand a range of satiation phenomena.","['satiation', 'working memory', 'enjoyment', 'cognitionINDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES APPROACH', 'SHORT-TERM-MEMORY', 'FOOD-INTAKE', 'MEDIATION ANALYSIS', 'COGNITIVE CONTROL', 'AGE-DIFFERENCES', 'ATTENTION', 'CAPACITY', 'INFORMATION', 'MEAL']","['satiation', 'working memory', 'working memory', 'capacity']",consumers
"Research Summary: Regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny question of whether to mandate a governance practice or allow for organic adoption. While mandates afford rapid diffusion, we theorize that they also result in ceremonial adoptions. Leveraging a quasi-natural experiment, we compare adoption outcomes for a governance practice-lead director adoption-that was mandated by the NYSE but not the NASDAQ. We find that NYSE firms are more likely than NASDAQ firms to have installed a lead director as a symbolic management tactic, so their lead directors are less effectual. We also find that transient institutional investors are deceived by this symbolic management, but dedicated institutional investors are not. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and analysts often desire to see companies introduce strict governance measures, such as proxy access and independent boards. Consequently, regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny issue of whether and when to mandate such practices for all companies. What they might not realize is that mandates may not work as well as they seem. Although more companies adopt reform under a mandate, they do so merely as a symbolic gesture. We look at one governance reform-appointing a lead director-finding that companies who introduce this reform as a result of a mandate appoint someone that is relatively toothless. We also find, though, that savvy investors are not actually fooled by this tactic and will trade out of firms that attempt such symbolic management.","['boards of directors', 'corporate governance', 'governance reform', 'impression management', 'lead directorsRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'CEO TURNOVER', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS', 'SYMBOLIC MANAGEMENT', 'SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM', 'BOARD COMPOSITION', 'FIRM-PERFORMANCE', 'FORMAL-STRUCTURE']","['governance reform', 'governance reform', 'institutional investors', 'institutional investors', 'symbolic management', 'symbolic management']",governance institutional investors analysts boards
"In examining how framing influences an audience's appreciation of products, practices, and people, including the framer, we take the perspective of the audience that evaluates the framing. We examine the effects of framing on evaluations when audiences are exposed to a multiplicity of frames, both by the same actor as the result of recurrent communications over time and by multiple actors who vie for attention. Using 36,012 research reports by securities analysts, covering the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry between 1989 and 2012, we tested the relationships between analysts' framing repertoires and professional investors' evaluations of analysts as measured in the publication of Institutional Investor's short list of the best analysts of the year. We found that investors appreciate analysts with framing repertoires that resonate with their needs, that are internally coherent over time, and that offer a moderate amount of novelty in comparison to others' framings. We also found that framing is particularly important for analysts without existing high status, that is, who have never before been recognized as stars or who cannot benefit from association with a prestigious employer.","['framing', 'evaluations', 'securities analysts', 'self-presentation', 'social situation', 'discourse', 'statusDUAL-PROCESS MODEL', 'IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT', 'CULTURAL CONSECRATION', 'SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION', 'SECURITIES ANALYSTS', 'IDENTITY', 'MOVEMENT', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LEGITIMACY', 'DISCOURSE']","['framing', 'evaluations', 'securities analysts', 'securities analysts', 'securities analysts', 'securities analysts']",securities analysts
"The success of a freemium model depends on the number of customers who purchase the premium version in the presence of the free version. The authors investigate the strategy of extending the premium product line to spur demand for the existing premium version. Extending the results of the standard product line model is insufficient in such cases because of the conceptual nuances in a freemium context. The authors conduct a randomized field experiment with an online content provider that offers book titles in a PDF version for free and sells the paperback version for a premium. The authors show that paperback titles accompanied by an additional premium version, either in e-book or hardcover format, have higher sales than those in the control condition. The positive impact on paperback sales is stronger for titles that are more popular or cheaper, and the effect of introducing the e-book version is higher when the e-book price is closer to the paperback price. By analyzing individual customer choices, the authors identify the existence of the compromise effect and the attraction effect in the extended product line setting, a significant contribution not only in the freemium context but also to the product line literature.","['freemium', 'product line', 'compromise effect', 'attraction effect', 'randomized field experimentPRODUCT-LINE', 'MARKET', 'MODEL', 'ATTRACTION']","['freemium', 'product line', 'product line', 'compromise effect', 'compromise effect', 'attraction effect', 'attraction effect', 'model', 'attraction']",freemium product line experiment attraction effect product line literature
"Research summary: Governments in emerging economies often use institutional intermediaries to promote entrepreneurship, and bridge the void between ventures and public funding. While prior literature describes what institutional intermediaries do, it leaves open how intermediaries support different types of entrepreneurs. By comparing science park and non-science park firms in Beijing and across China, we distinguish which entrepreneurs benefit from certification versus capability-building through the introduction of two new constructs: skill adequacy and context relevance. Broadly, our study adds insights at the nexus of emerging economies and entrepreneurship research, and to the tie formation and institutional intermediaries literatures.Managerial summary: A key dilemma facing entrepreneurs is how to finance their ventures. While entrepreneurs in developed economies can seek VC or angel investment, entrepreneurs in emerging economies often need to pursue potential government funding opportunities. Our study highlights three strategies for acquiring government funding. Well-connected entrepreneurs can leverage their political ties to acquire such funding. Less-connected entrepreneurs can leverage science parks that in emerging markets are designed to help governments to identify promising ventures. For returnees whose ample experience abroad may not fit with local ways of doing business, gaining science park admission can certify quality and so ease the path to government funding. For technically skilled local entrepreneurs who lack business skills, science parks can help build such skills, which then ease the path to government funding.

"Factor analyses of data from an organizational climate survey suggest that organizational politics is an important dimension of peoples' perceptions of the work environment. These data were used to examine antecedents and consequences of politics perceptions using the framework suggested by Ferris, Russ and Fandt (1989). Measures of perceived intergroup cooperation, clarity of roles and responsibilities, and fairness of rewards/recognition were most predictive of politics perceptions. Minority status was the only personal characteristic that predicted politics perceptions. When controlling for its antecedents, perceptions of organizational politics were only related to perceived innovation. Analyses using structural equation modeling indicated that the relationships between politics and its antecedents were not influenced by an overall affective response to the work environment.","['nanCLIMATE', 'SATISFACTION', 'INNOVATION', 'GOODNESS', 'MODEL', 'WORK', 'FIT']","['innovation', 'model', 'work']",climate environment
"Consumers may act on the spur of the moment, driven by fun and curiosity, or be goal-oriented, task-focused utilitarians. This study investigates the effects of consumers' hedonic and utilitarian orientation online on price consciousness, frequency of purchase, purchased amount, intention to re-patronize a Web site and expertise with the Internet. It specifically considers purchasing, not mere browsing, basing on data collected on customers of one of the largest Italian online retailers for electronics. The data show significant differences between hedonic and utilitarian orientation online with regard to past purchase frequency, the amount purchased and the intention to re-patronize the Web site in the future. The findings suggest that utilitarianism is strongly present online, and is valuable, thus utilitarian consumers should not be neglected, but hedonism is even more profitable, impacting on the number of items purchased and the intention to come back to the Web site. No differences are found in the level of price consciousness or in the degree of expertise with the Internet. (C) 2011 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Corporate governance practices are arguably diffusing across the world. This paper examines the adoption of the committee-based governance system (i.e. audit, nomination, and remuneration) in Japanese firms, a practice common in Anglo-American capitalism but potentially contestable in Japan. The study finds that firms that are internationally exposed through cross listing are more likely to adopt the committee system. Moreover, more experienced and highly cross-held firms, with larger proportions of foreign ownership, are more likely to adopt the committee system. On the other hand our study finds partial support for the hypothesis that larger proportions of bank ownership are negatively associated with the adoption of the committee system, suggesting a gradual withdrawal by banks from the traditional monitoring of firms. This paper adds to the longstanding debate on the convergence on or persistent divergence from the Anglo-American corporate governance system. The study thus provides insights into corporate governance changes in non-Anglo/American countries that face a struggle between global capital market forces for change and deep-seated institutional practices of continuity.","['adoption', 'board of directors', 'corporate governance', 'the committee system', 'JapanINSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS', 'STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'BOARD COMPOSITION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ADOPTION', 'INERTIA', 'FIRMS', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'SHAREHOLDERS']","['adoption', 'corporate governance', 'corporate governance', 'the committee system', 'the committee system', 'the committee system', 'adoption', 'firms']",corporate governance japanese
"Franchising has attracted the attention of retailing and entrepreneurship scholars in the past three decades, but evidence pertaining to how franchising affects financial performance is mixed and inconclusive. Thus, the question remains as to whether franchising firms exhibit better financial performance than non-franchising firms in the same industry. In order to find an answer to this question, our study compares the risk-adjusted financial performance of franchising versus non-franchising restaurant firms over the 1995-2008 interval, using five different performance measures: the Sharpe Ratio, the Treynor Ratio, the Jensen Index, the Sortino Ratio, and the Upside Potential Ratio. For each measure, the results revealed that franchising restaurant firms outperformed their non-franchising counterparts. Thus, we provide very robust evidence that franchising is superior on average in the restaurant industry, which can help explain the increasing popularity of franchising as a business form.

"Given that stakeholders often commit more than capital to a startup, they commonly stress how important it is for entrepreneurs to be coachable. To date, however, coachability has received little attention in entrepreneurship research. We address this gap by first establishing the entrepreneurial coachability construct and validating a measurement scale. Then, drawing on social exchange and signaling theories, we develop and test a novel framework in which coachability influences a potential investor's willingness to invest. We find that entrepreneurial coachability functions as a viable signal in a pitch setting, but this impact is conditional on the investor's prior coaching experience.","['coachability', 'new venture finance', 'social exchange theory5-FACTOR MODEL', 'PERSONALITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'SELECTION', 'VALIDATION', 'STAGE', 'OVERCONFIDENCE', 'PREPAREDNESS', 'SALESPERSON', 'PERCEPTIONS']",['coachability'],coachability signaling experience
"The purpose of this study was to explore whether certain cognitive factors of potential entrepreneurs (as measured by a personal efficacy scale and the kinds of reasons people offer for their decision to undertake efforts to start a business) can be used to predict their subsequent persistence in business start-up activities and in new venture creation success. Two hypotheses were tested: H1: Potential entrepreneurs who offer internal and stable explanations for their plans for getting into business (e.g., ''I have always wanted to own my own business'') should be more likely to persist in actions that lead to successfully starting a business. H2: Potential entrepreneurs with high personal efficacy scores should be more likely to persist in actions that lead to successfully starring a business. The beginning pool of subjects for this research consisted of 142 consecutive preventure clients (47 women, 95 men) of a Small Business Development Center between October 1990 and February 1991. As part of their initial consultation, these individuals were asked to explain their decision to enter business. These responses were coded on the basis of a detailed procedure derived from the attributional model (Weiner 1985). Potential entrepreneurs also responded to a locus-of-control questionnaire: Paulhus (1983) Spheres of Control Scale. In February 1992, all 142 people were sent a follow-up questionnaire designed to assess the extent of their new venture development activity in the intervening year. Responses from 85 individuals were available for this analysis. The follow-up questionnaire listed 29 separate activities involved in starting a business. These activities were grouped into five major categories: gathering market information, estimating potential profits, finishing the groundwork for the company, structuring the company, and setting up business operations. The measure of success at getting into business was operationalized by the question: ''Have you completed the first sale (defined as having delivered the product or service and collected the payment from your customer)?'' An analysis of the results found that H1 (internal/stable attributions, e.g., ''I have always wanted to be my own boss'') was supported for female potential entrepreneurs, whereas external/stable attributions (e.g., ''I had identified a market need'') were significant for male potential entrepreneurs. SIC code classifications revealed no significant differences in the sorts of businesses being contemplated by women and men. H2 (personal efficacy) was not supported. Those activities that focused on setting up business operations (e.g., purchasing materials, hiring employees, producing the product/service, distributing the product) distinguished potential entrepreneurs who had stalled businesses from those who had not. We believe that one of the important features of this research is the use of a longitudinal research design. By measuring attributions before these potential entrepreneurs had started (or nor started) their businesses, we can make stronger claims for a causal relationship between initial attributions and each individual's subsequent success or failure in business start-up. Given all of the events and activities that occur between an individual's attributions for getting into business and the actual start-up, the attributional findings about male and female potential entrepreneurs have important implications for future research and practice. Men and women do have different reasons for getting into business that appear to be significant indicators of their future ability to start a business successfully. We believe that the development of measures focusing on details of the attributional model (i.e., perceptions of skills, abilities, the difficulty of the task, luck, and the value of the opportunity) will likely lead to a more comprehensive and accurate conception of the factors that influence entrepreneurial persistence. We offer some suggestions for how the use of an attributional model might influence the selection, counseling, and training of potential entrepreneurs.","['nanPSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FAILURE', 'EMOTION', 'GENDER', 'FIRMS']","['entrepreneurial', 'failure']",scale start up
"A significant amount of research on numerosity demonstrates that product perceptions are often influenced by the scale on which numerical attribute information is presented. However, fewer studies have examined how self-control is influenced by the numerosity of cost information (e.g., price, nutritional content) in situations that may violate a personal goal. The present research demonstrates that, in such situations, the numerosity of cost information has a stronger influence on self-control when consumers are highly focused on restraint. Because restrained consumers regulate their behavior by anticipating the negative emotions from violating their goals, they experience a narrowing of attention during self-control decisions that makes them more reliant on numerosity as a cue for judgment. The results of eight experiments demonstrate that consumers who are primed or predisposed to be high in restraint display less self-control when cost information is presented on a contracted scale with small numbers compared to an expanded scale with large numbers. When consumers are less focused on restraint, numerosity has less of an effect on self-control because unrestrained consumers do not experience an analogous narrowing of attention.","['numerosity', 'self-control', 'attention narrowing', 'anticipated emotionsPACKAGE SIZE', 'EMOTIONS', 'AROUSAL', 'SENSITIVITY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'STRESS', 'WEIGHT', 'CHOICE', 'UNITS']","['numerosity', 'self control', 'self control', 'emotions', 'behavior']",numerosity perceptions attention
"To function optimally, most workgroups need an interdependent mix of members in strategically core and noncore roles who work together effectively. However, although researchers have investigated the contributions of star performers and strategically core group members, we know relatively little about individuals in noncore roles and how they may facilitate group functioning and contribute to the relational climate of organizations. In this article we develop a multilevel, bottom-up model that explains two paths through which employees in noncore roles facilitate the dissemination of relational coordination in organizations. We leverage insights from self-categorization theory and relational coordination theory to explain different ways noncore role incumbents attempt to enact their noncore role identities. We then describe how the relational stances of those occupying core roles can enable or hinder the identity validation of those in noncore roles, and how validating the role-based identities of members in noncore roles fosters relational coordination at the group level while fostering positive identification with noncore roles. Finally, we theorize about how relational coordination facilitated by noncore role incumbents contributes to the relational climate of the organization, which subsequently motivates core role incumbents throughout the organization to support their teammates in noncore roles.","['nanSOCIAL IDENTITY', 'CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'WORK GROUPS', 'DIRTY WORK', 'RELATIONSHIP CONFLICT', 'SELF-AFFIRMATION', 'STRATEGIC CORE', 'MENTAL MODELS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TEAM']",['team'],workgroups self categorization identity
"Research Summary: We identify two types of knowledge leverage behaviors undertaken by acquiring firms: integrated and independent knowledge leverage. We address how the prior exploitation or exploration orientation of acquirers influence these two modes of knowledge leverage behaviors. The degree of exploitation of acquirers promotes integrating their existing knowledge with acquired knowledge in innovative actions. In contrast, the degree of exploration of acquirers increases the likelihood that new innovations will use acquired knowledge without integrating it with their prior knowledge. In addition, the firm's prior acquisition rate moderates the relationship between the acquiring firms' previous exploitation or exploration orientation and their knowledge leverage mode. The findings of this article suggest that pre-acquisition innovation capabilities are distinct from but influence the post-acquisition innovation actions. Managerial Summary: Firms often undertake acquisitions to gain access to new knowledge, but they can differ dramatically in how they leverage acquired knowledge. We show that the firm's prior innovation patterns drive this choice. Firms that have previously focused on incremental innovations in their internal innovation efforts tend to integrate acquired knowledge with their own prior knowledge. In contrast, firms that have previously pursued bold innovations tend to leverage acquired knowledge alone in new innovations. Thus, we show that firms use acquisitions as a means to extend their internal innovation patterns-firms that have focused on incremental innovations extend that with acquisitions by linking new innovations to their prior knowledge while firms that have pursued bold initiatives use acquired knowledge to move in new technology directions.","['acquisition rate', 'exploitation and exploration', 'knowledge leverage', 'pre-acquisition innovation', 'post-acquisition innovation', 'technology acquisitionsHORIZONTAL ACQUISITIONS', 'INNOVATION PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGIC MOMENTUM', 'INTEGRATION', 'FIRMS', 'ACQUIRERS', 'REDEPLOYMENT', 'CAPABILITIES', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'EXPERIENCE']","['acquisition rate', 'acquisition rate', 'knowledge leverage', 'knowledge leverage', 'pre acquisition innovation', 'pre acquisition innovation', 'pre acquisition innovation', 'post acquisition innovation', 'post acquisition innovation', 'post acquisition innovation', 'firms', 'acquirers', 'capabilities']",firms knowledge leverage exploration

"The field of product innovation has expanded rapidly and clear insights regarding the relationship between product innovativeness and new product performance have become more elusive and difficult to discern through qualitative reviews of the literature. To offer much needed clarity, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of 95 correlations on product innovativeness and new product performance that were recorded from 32 studies on the topic. The findings reveal that although the average correlation of 0.24 for innovativeness with performance is small to moderate in size, the relationship is more substantial when various measurement and contextual elements are considered. For example, innovativeness measures that include a meaningfulness dimension yield stronger estimates of relationship strength. The findings also reveal that innovativeness today may not represent the same competitive advantage as in previous years unless the focus is on products rather than services, and specifically, new-to-the-market rather than new-to-the-firm products. Thus, innovativeness can be particularly relevant to new product success but only under certain conditions.","['product innovativeness', 'meta-analysis', 'new product performanceDEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS', 'BUSINESS PERFORMANCE', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'FIRMS', 'IMPACT', 'INFORMATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'SERVICES', 'STRATEGY']","['product innovativeness', 'product innovativeness', 'meta analysis', 'meta analysis', 'services']",innovativeness meta analysis
"We posit a female advantage in the relationship between self-reliance and leadership evaluations. We test this prediction in four studies. First, using multi-rater evaluations of young managers, we find that self-reliance relates positively to leadership evaluations for women, but not for men. Next, in each of three experiments, we manipulate the gender of a leader and the agentic trait he or she displays (e.g., self-reliance, dominance, no discrete agentic trait). We find that self-reliant female leaders are evaluated as better leaders than self-reliant male leaders are. In contrast, we find a male advantage or no gender advantage for dominant leaders or leaders who are described positively, but not in terms of any discrete agentic trait. Consistent with expectancy violation theory, the female advantage in the relationship between self-reliance and leadership evaluations emerges because self-reliant female leaders are seen as similarly competent, but more communal, than self-reliant male leaders are. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the effects of self-reliance, gender stereotypes, and stereotype violations on leadership evaluations.","['nanTRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'WOMEN', 'BACKLASH', 'STEREOTYPES', 'STABILITY', 'AUTONOMY', 'ESTEEM', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'PERFORMANCE']","['women', 'stereotypes']",
"While a few researchers have started to chip away at the notion that retail density is always negative, extant studies do not empirically address the question of why some shoppers respond negatively to a specific level of density while others respond positively. We examine this issue by drawing upon field theory (Lewin 1939) to shed light on how shoppers vary in terms of deeper motives (McClelland 1953) to seek control or intimacy with others in retail mall settings, and whether these motives influence shopping orientations. Shopping orientation is then hypothesized to affect perceptions of crowding, and, in turn, subsequent affective responses to the mall shopping experience. Moreover, we examine whether individual differences (gender and age) can help retailers segment those with different shopping orientations and the motives that influence these orientations. We found that task and social shopping orientations were influenced by deeper motives for control and intimacy. The causal relationships between shopping motive, shopping orientation, and consumers' affective responses of stress and excitement were also discovered. Finally, we address theoretical and managerial implications of our results.","['Excitement', 'Stress', 'Shopping orientation', 'Shopping motivation', 'CrowdingCROSS-CULTURAL DIFFERENCES', 'CUSTOMER RESPONSE', 'PERSONAL CONTROL', 'RETAIL STORES', 'SELF-CONCEPT', 'BEHAVIOR', 'SATISFACTION', 'TYPOLOGY', 'POWER', 'ENVIRONMENTS']","['excitement', 'stress', 'shopping orientation', 'shopping orientation']",gender
"This research examines the comparative effects of production manager and worker turnover in service and manufacturing settings. We suggest that, due to the centrality of human action in services and the ability of manufacturers to insulate the technical core, service and manufacturing companies are differentially dependent on and impacted by the loss of production manager and worker knowledge. The results from a survey of 150 service and manufacturing firms provide partial support for this notion and show that turnover impacts these organizations differently. More specifically, we find that: (1) the negative impact of production worker turnover on firm performance is greater in service settings than in manufacturing settings; and (2) the negative impact of production worker turnover on firm performance is greater than the impact of production manager turnover in service firms. In addition, our findings show that organizational capital moderates the turnover-performance relationship for production workers in service firms.","['employee turnover', 'organizational capital', 'production knowledge loss', 'service and manufacturingHUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'EMPLOYEE TURNOVER', 'VOLUNTARY TURNOVER', 'INFORMATION ASYMMETRY', 'COLLECTIVE TURNOVER', 'UNIT', 'RATES', 'CAPABILITIES', 'DIVERSIFICATION']","['organizational capital', 'organizational capital', 'rates']",turnover knowledge organizational capital

"Crowdfunding is an emerging financing channel for entrepreneurs to raise money for their innovative projects online. Crowdfunding project implementation has not gained enough attention in research. This article develops a research model to investigate (1) the relationships among crowdfunding implementation success criteriarewarding delivery timeliness, the extent to which the reward meets specifications and sponsors overall satisfaction, and (2) the moderating factors on the relationships, including project social responsibility, entrepreneur activeness, and community benefit. Data were collected via a survey of sponsors on Demohour, a well-known crowdfunding platform in China, to test the proposed model. The findings suggest that rewarding delivery timeliness and meeting specifications are of great importance to increase sponsor satisfaction. All three moderating factors have negative effects on the relationship between meeting specifications and sponsor satisfaction. The research makes theoretical contributions and has practical implications. Crowdfunding platforms and entrepreneurs should pay more attention to delivery timeliness and quality of reward and to sponsors' satisfaction, which are criteria for crowdfunding project implementation success. In addition, the role of project social responsibility, entrepreneur activeness, and community benefit should be considered for crowdfunding project implementation since they can moderate the relationship between the extent to which the product meets specifications and the sponsor's overall satisfaction.","['Community benefit', 'crowdfunding', 'crowdsourcing', 'entrepreneurship', 'IS implementation success', 'reward-based crowdfunding', 'social responsibilityCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'SATISFACTION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'SYSTEMS', 'CHINA', 'RISK', 'BIAS']","['community benefit', 'community benefit', 'crowdfunding', 'satisfaction', 'china']",crowdfunding crowdfunding model delivery timeliness
"Radical innovations are engines of economic growth and the focus of much academic and practitioner interest, yet some fundamental questions remain unanswered. The authors use theoretical arguments on the risk associated with radical innovations, and the resources needed for them, to answer the following questions on the sources and financial consequences of radical innovation: (1) Who introduces a greater number of radical innovations: dominant or nondominant firms? (2) How great are the financial rewards to radical innovations, and how do these rewards vary across dominant and nondominant firms? (3) Is it only a firm's resources in the aggregate or also its focus and leverage of resources that make its innovations more financially valuable? and (4) Which are more valuable: innovations that incorporate a breakthrough technology or innovations that provide a substantial increase in customer benefits? The authors pool information from a disparate set of sources in the pharmaceutical industry to study these questions. Results indicate that a large majority of radical innovations come from a minority of firms. The financial rewards of innovation vary dramatically across firms and are tied closely to firms' resource base. Firms that provide higher per-product levels of marketing and technology support obtain much greater financial rewards from their radical innovations than do other firms. Firms that have greater depth and breadth in their product portfolio also gain more from their radical innovations.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'SHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'MARKET VALUE', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'INDUSTRY', 'CAPABILITIES', 'IMPACT', 'SIZE']",['industry'],radical

Subjects rated consumer trivia statements as more true when they had been exposed to those statements earlier in the experiment. Simple repetition increased subsequent truth ratings. Moreover, when subjects processed the information during initial exposure in a less involving fashion, the effect of repetition on truth became more pronounced. Familiarity emerged as a key mediator of the truth effect. When subjects experienced an it rings a bell reaction, they judged the information to be more true.

"The 24/7 economy creates new organizational temporalities including a temporal structure called layered-task time (LTT), characterized by greater simultaneity, fragmentation, contamination, and constraint. This paper develops a measure of LTT, and examines the relationship between its components and job satisfaction as moderated by an individual's polychronicity, or propensity for multitasking. A total of 306 employees from various jobs, organizations, and industries were surveyed. The LTT measures provide promising initial evidence of reliability and content validity.

"Despite decades of research on organizational disasters, such events remain too common. Scholars across a wide range of disciplines agree that one of the most viable approaches to preventing such catastrophes is to observe near-misses and use them to identify and eliminate problems before they produce large failures. Unfortunately, these important warning signals are too often ignored because they are perceived as successes rather than near-misses (or near-failures). In this article, we explore the effect of a climate for safety on improving near-miss recognition by observers, hypothesizing that safety climate increases the level of attention that observers pay to the underlying processes that generate an apparently successful outcome. Using a database of anomaly reports for unmanned NASA missions, we show that organizational safety climate and project stakes increase reporting rates of near-misses, both independently and interactively. In follow-up laboratory experiments, we confirm the independence of these effects to improve the likelihood that people differentiate near-miss outcomes from successes. Results suggest organizations can increase the recognition of near-misses with organizational messages that emphasize a positive safety climate.","['decisions under risk', 'uncertainty', 'individual decision making', 'decision makingSAFETY CLIMATE', 'OUTCOME BIAS', 'JUDGMENT', 'ERRORS', 'INFORMATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'ATTENTION', 'SUPPORT', 'MODEL']",['attention'],disasters near misses observers
"To overcome resource constraints and achieve exponential growth, a new venture must rely on early customers of its products to communicate value and commitment to others. For this reason, founders of new ventures focus more on early customers as a key element of their founding strategy than on other elements. But when do early customers really add value to new ventures? Scholars have used legitimacy theory to examine the benefits of gaining acceptance and conveying firm quality through conforming to social norms and following similar methods and forms. It has been argued that, independent of the customers of products and services, observable legitimacy characteristics of a new organization function as signals and are used by critical external constituents to infer the quality of the firm. This research, however, sheds little light on the manner in which firm legitimacy influences how potential customers respond to the existence of early customers. The current study therefore proposes that, depending on types of legitimacy (cognitive, regulative, and normative), early customers may have a different impact on subsequent firm performance. While a young firm may reduce information asymmetry that hampers their attractiveness to customers and other external stakeholders via the costly signal of obtaining early customers, the signal fit argument suggests that discrepancy between a signal and the characteristics of the signaler can lead to unreliable quality and lower signaling value. Legitimacy is critical because, when legitimacy is absent, early customers may not serve as an effective signal for the new venture. This study therefore explores the extent to which the signaling effect of early customers depends on these three types of legitimacy. This study employs the Kauffman Firm Survey (KFS) public database, a panel study of 4928 new businesses founded in the United States in 2004. Four surveys (baseline, first follow-up, second follow-up, and third follow-up) were conducted using self-administered Web survey and computer-assisted telephone interview methods. In this study, the independent variables include early customers and the three types of legitimacy (cognitive, regulative, and normative) as well as a set of control variables. All independent variables were measured at the founding of the businesses in the KFS baseline survey. Dependent variables in this study include second-year revenue, third-year revenue, and fourth-year revenue as measured in the KFS first, second, and third follow-up surveys, respectively. The multinomial logistic regression and Heckman sample selection model is used to analyze the data. Results show that early customers are beneficial to new ventures, and the benefits of early customers to firm performance are higher when there is cognitive legitimacy from a capable founding team and regulative legitimacy from paying federal Social Security and Medicare taxes. Surprisingly, while incorporation improves performance for new ventures, the benefit of having early customers relative to not having early customers is lower, not higher, when the firm is incorporated than when the firm is not incorporated. Early customers have the same benefit regardless of the presence of normative legitimacy through the presence of a network with suppliers. This study therefore offers insights into the role of early customers at founding. Early customers can be very useful for founders with significant experience, and it may be a good strategy to seek them out. However, it appears that there are specific conditions under which pursuing early customers may not be an effective strategy. Founders can make strategic decisions not to pursue early customers if there are no anticipated payoffs.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL LEGITIMACY', 'SAMPLE SELECTION', 'MARKET', 'SURVIVAL', 'VENTURES', 'GROWTH', 'BUSINESS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'REPUTATION', 'INNOVATION']","['sample selection', 'sample selection', 'ventures', 'growth', 'business']",impact performance

"An ongoing debate in the interfirm exchange literature concerns whether economic and social governance mechanisms function as substitutes or complements. We advance a more nuanced approach to examining how detailed contracts and centralized control interact with relational governance differentially in curbing local supplier opportunism in emerging markets. We suggest that where legal institutions are weak, detailed contracts are ineffective in containing partner opportunism in contractually specified areas. Under such circumstances, relational governance provides a proxy for legal institutions to ensure contract execution. Meanwhile, relational governance serves as an alternative mechanism to centralized control for ensuring contingency adaptations. Based on a sample of 168 foreign buyer-local supplier exchanges in China, we find that relational governance complements detailed contracts but substitutes for centralized control in curtailing opportunism. Therefore foreign firms must be cautious in their combinative use of social and economic mechanisms in governing exchanges with local suppliers in emerging markets.

"In order to be effective, managers at all levels of the firm must engage in resource management activities, and these efforts are synchronized and orchestrated by top management. Using a specific type of strategic resource, commitment-based human resource systems, we examine the effect of CEO resource orchestration in a multi-industry sample of 190 Korean firms. Our results demonstrate that CEO emphasis on strategic HRM is a significant antecedent to commitment-based HR systems. Furthermore, our results also suggest that CEO emphasis on strategic HRM has its primary effects on firm performance through commitment-based HR systems.

"Following a strategic approach, the authors test a universal model across cultural groups. They propose that consumers infer brand values (i.e., internal, external, and fun and enjoyment values)from packages and form their purchase intentions on the basis of those values. The authors test this proposition on three culturally diverse subsamples who evaluated three fictional brands each for one hedonic product (chocolate) and one utilitarian product (salt). The results indicate that variances in consumers' use of package-evoked brand values are dependent on culture and are specifically driven by consumer values. The decision-making patterns studied seem to be universal in existence but not in relative or absolute importance. The findings underscore the ability of packages to convey meaning in terms of brand values; they also affirm the role of brand values as predictors of consumer purchase intentions depending on cultural groups. The authors conclude by outlining implications for international brand management and research.","['package design', 'Germany', 'Turkey', 'universals', 'consumer valuesSELF-CONCEPT', 'SOCIAL VALUES', 'CONSUMER SUSCEPTIBILITY', 'INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'AESTHETIC RESPONSES', 'NORMATIVE INFLUENCE', 'PERSONAL VALUES', 'UNITED-STATES', 'BRANDS', 'IMAGE']",['brands'],model
"This study proposes a multi-dimension, multi-contingent fit perspective for examining different practices adapted by entrepreneurial firms in acquiring human resources. We posit that while environmental constraints are important considerations for adapting recruitment practices through networks, strategic needs and interpersonal dynamics are the key drivers behind the evolution of such practices. As they transit from the startup to the growth phase, entrepreneurial firms utilize different network pools in search of diversity, yet cling to strong ties to find talents with common values and goals. Our findings carry important implications for future research in human resource management by integrating the macro- and micro-perspective, and at the same time, enhance the understanding of network effects and their strategic bearings in the entrepreneurial process, specifically in the acquisition of human resources.

Existing analyses of diffusion frequently note the variation, selection or replication of management innovations, yet few have linked these together with the common observation that some innovations seem to 'evolve'. This paper draws on qualitative evidence from two case-studies of BPR implementation to illustrate that the replication, selection and variation of management innovations can form evolutionary algorithms ('memes') which support diffusion processes, and, in doing so, clarifies the ways in which innovations contribute to their own replication and explains how the high 'failure' rates associated with BPR can sometimes improve its chances of reproduction.","['nanTOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATION THEORY', 'FASHIONS', 'INFORMATION', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'METAPHOR', 'EVOLUTION', 'NETWORKS', 'POLITICS', 'ADOPTION']",['evolution'],diffusion management innovations replication evolutionary algorithms memes

"This research examines how a general sense of resource availability influences consumers' product use creativity. The authors propose and demonstrate that the salience of resource scarcity versus abundance enhances the novelty of product use solutions in independent consumption environments. An investigation of the underlying process finds that scarcity salience activates a constraint mindset that persists and manifests itself through reduced functional fixedness in subsequent product usage contexts (i.e., makes consumers think beyond the traditional functionality of a given product), consequently enhancing product use creativity. This work advances the extant creativity literature, currently limited to examining the effects of context-specific resource constraints, by establishing a context-independent linkage between resource availability and product use creativity. Furthermore, this research contributes to the scarcity literature, which has primarily focused on investigating the quantity and frequency of consumption, by examining the impact of scarcity on the quality of consumption solutions.","['creativity', 'innovativeness', 'product use', 'scarcity', 'abundance', 'resource constraintsSOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGY', 'CONSUMER CREATIVITY', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'CONSTRAINTS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'CONSUMPTION', 'THINKING', 'CHOICE', 'SCALE', 'INNOVATIVENESS']","['creativity', 'product use', 'product use', 'scarcity', 'abundance', 'constraints', 'consumption']",use creativity resource scarcity fixedness
"This paper introduces a knowledge-based view of corporate acquisitions and tests the post-acquisition consequences on performance of integration decisions and capability-building mechanisms. In our model, the acquiring firm decides both how much to integrate the acquired firm and the extent to which it replaces this firm's top management team. It can also learn to manage the post-acquisition integration process by tacitly accumulating acquisition experience and explicitly codifying it in manuals, systems, and other acquisition-specific tools. Using a sample of 228 acquisitions in the U.S. banking industry, we find that knowledge codification strongly and positively influences acquisition performance, while experience accumulation does not. Furthermore, increasing levels of post-acquisition integration strengthen the positive effect of codification. Finally, the level of integration between the two merged firms significantly enhances performance, while replacing top managers in the acquired firm negatively impacts performance, all else being equal. Implications are drawn for both organizational learning theory and a knowledge-based approach to corporate strategy research.

"Just as firms compete for customers, they also vie for reputational status across their relevant constituent groups. To many firms, a reputation as an innovative company is something that is both prized and actively sought after. Despite an abundance of anecdotal evidence pointing to several firms' active pursuit of an innovative reputation, there is little empirical evidence to evaluate the soundness of this pursuit. On a general level, this research recognizes that firms compete for competitive advantage via their tangible and intangible resources. Much of the innovation literature centers on the tangible impact that new product development initiatives have on outcomes of innovation. Yet research investigations of the less tangible facets of innovation, such as a reputation, remain relatively uninvestigated despite their promise as a source of sustainable competitive advantage. This study investigates the effects of a corporate reputation for product innovation (RPI) and its impact on consumers. Consumer involvement levels are proposed to mediate the relationship between RPI and consumer outcomes. Empirical results indicate that a high consumer perceived RPI, via the involvement construct, leads to excitement toward and heightened loyalty to the innovative firm. A more positive overall corporate image and tolerance for occasional product failures are also positive outcomes noted in the results. Contrary to expectations, a high perceived RPI does not lead to a consumer propensity to pay price premiums.","['nanINVOLVEMENT', 'MODEL', 'PRICE', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'QUALITY', 'PREANNOUNCEMENTS', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'ATTITUDE', 'SEARCH', 'NAME']","['price', 'search']",competitive advantage new product development image

Thus, we propose that there is an opportunity for a global employer positioning approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"This article examines how ads with different combinations of source and nonsource cues activate culture-bound cognitions among members of a dominant culture and members of a subculture within that dominant culture. As participants in both the dominant culture and their own subculture, members of subcultures are posited to possess knowledge of both groups. As such, their reactions to mainstream advertising are expected to be similar to those of members of the dominant culture. However, because members of the dominant culture are not as familiar with the subculture, their reactions to cues contained in subculture-targeted ads will differ from those of members of the subculture. Results of an experiment show that dominant culture source cues activate highly internalized dominant cultural models for all participants, leading to self-referencing and favorable ad attitudes. However, subculture source and nonsource cues interact to activate subcultural knowledge, induce self-referencing, and enhance ad attitudes only among members of the subculture.","['nanNONTARGET MARKETS', 'SOCIAL COGNITION', 'IMPACT', 'DISTINCTIVENESS', 'BICULTURALISM', 'INFORMATION', 'STEREOTYPES', 'ATTITUDES', 'JUDGMENT', 'TARGET']","['attitudes', 'target']",self referencing
"In the past three decades or so, globalization/regionalization, migration and reverse migration (also referred to as brain circulation), the ascendancy of emerging markets, the demand for people with a global mindset, and the worldwide war for talent have brought about fundamental changes to the nature, magnitude, and raison d'etre for human resource management (HRM) in a global context. These changes require us to adopt new lenses to fully understand the dynamics that impact international human resource management (IHRM) policies and practices. This paper presents new perspectives on IHRM as they relate to research on multicultural teams under the three dimensions of diversity (separation, variety, and disparity) posited by Harrison and Klein (2007), and brain circulation in the context of movement of peoples across countries. These perspectives go toward the traditional approach of studying expatriates, whether company-sponsored or self-initiated assignments. The paper discusses how these new perspectives can set the agenda for future research on IHRM. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Communal consumption is often described as inherently playful; previous research focuses mainly on successful ludic communal experiences and largely disregards their potential pitfalls. Moreover, the marketer is usually seen as the primary facilitator of ludic experiences, which has marginalized the role of the consumer. This article explores how consumers produce and sustain ludic consumption community experiences in the face of growing instrumental costs. It assumes a practice theory lens and is based on an ethnographic inquiry into cosplay, a time-and resource-intensive form of pop culture masquerade and craft consumption. Prolonged engagement in the cosplay community leads to growing emotional, material, temporal, and competence-related costs, which hinder playful experiences. Consumers practice modularization, reinforcement, and collaboration to overcome these costs and maintain the important ludic sensations that motivate communal engagements.","['ludic consumption', 'cosplay', 'play', 'communal consumption', 'practice theoryCONSUMER', 'MARKET', 'IDENTITY', 'LEISURE', 'ETHNOGRAPHY', 'DYNAMICS', 'MEANINGS', 'AUDIENCE', 'CULTURE', 'FIELD']","['ludic consumption', 'ludic consumption', 'cosplay', 'play', 'communal consumption', 'communal consumption', 'market', 'culture']",communal consumption consumers costs practice modularization
"Unemployment and proprietorship can be related in several ways. As unemployment increases, individuals with fewer job alternatives may choose to start their own business resulting in an increase in proprietorship. Alternatively, if an increase in unemployment is the result of a depressed economy, higher unemployment may lead to less demand for the products and services of proprietors, thus reducing proprietorship. Finally, greater proprietorship may lead to future increases in employment as these businesses grow. This can potentially reduce unemployment in the long run. We apply a panel vector autoregressive model to unemployment and proprietorship data from the U.S. states for the years 1976 to 2009 to examine if these effects are apparent in the data. We find that unemployment Granger causes proprietorship, but proprietorship does not Granger cause unemployment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The findings indicate that(1) changes in board structure that increase the board's independence from management are associated with higher levels of CEO ingratiation and persuasion behavior toward board members, and (2) such influence behaviors, in turn, serve to offset the effect of increased structural board independence on corporate strategy and CEO compensation policy.

"This special issue reviews contemporary gender and diversity insights into management and organization studies (MOS). The purpose of this issue is to critically evaluate key threads and concepts contributing to academic debates in diversity, gender and feminist theorizing. This paper highlights key threads in current scholarship, including relationality, power, intersectionality and social constructionist epistemologies and, in so doing, uncovers new insights and contributions. The paper provides a model which locates different themes and moments in the development of gender and diversity scholarship and acts as a heuristic device which can guide gender and diversity scholarship and assist in conceptualizing the field. Building on the key threads weaving the special issue together, the paper advances new understandings of gender and diversity through integrating feminist post-colonial scholarship, transnationalism and geographies of space and place literatures. The paper argues for scholars to re-imagine different possibilities for gender and diversity enquiry so as to encourage interdisciplinarity and align with social science research in contemporary critiques of globalization and global social capital in order to add richness and complexity to current theorizing. Specifically, the authors argue for MOS researchers to engage in dialogue with all global stakeholders, and they encourage cross-fertilization of theories and values between writers from both the Global North and the Global South.","['nanMANAGEMENT', 'POLITICS', 'WOMEN', 'RACE', 'INTERSECTIONALITY', 'GLOBALIZATION', 'MASCULINITIES', 'POSTMODERNISM', 'EXPERIENCES', 'STRUGGLE']","['intersectionality', 'globalization']",and organization studies

"Much recent thought in strategy has stressed the importance of organizational integration for competitive advantage. Empirical studies of product development have supported this emphasis by correlating integrating practices and superior performance. We propose, from a resource-based or capability view, that this correlation results from integration leading to patterns of shared knowledge among firm members, with the shared knowledge constituting a resource underlying product development capability. To explore this connection, we examine the product development efforts of a scientific software company. We define the 'glitch' as a costly error possible only because knowledge was not shared, and measure the influence of glitches on firm performance. At this company, gaps in shared knowledge did cause the company to incur significant excess costs. We also identify a set of 'syndromes' that can lead to glitches, and measure the relative importance of these syndromes. The glitch concept may offer a general tool for practical measurement of the marginal benefits of shared knowledge.

"This article examines the long-run stock market performance of German and Spanish initial public offerings (IPOs) between 1990 and 2000. We distinguish between family and nonfamily-owned business IPOs by using the power subscale of the F-PEC. Buy-and hold-abnormal returns (BHAR) are calculated in order to determine abnormal returns. Our results show that three years after going public, investors, on average, realized an abnormal return of -32.8% for German and -36.7% for Spanish IPOs. In both countries, nonfamily business IPOs perform insignificantly better. Regression analyses show that for the whole sample there is a positive company size effect. In family-owned businesses, strong family involvement has a positive impact on the long-run stock market performance, whereas the age of the firm has a negative influence.","['nanINITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS', 'MARKET', 'OWNERSHIP', 'RETURNS', 'FIRM', 'ISSUES', 'TESTS']","['market', 'returns', 'firm']",initial public offerings ipos power involvement
"Customer solutions have been touted as the next service-growth engine. Yet, pursuing a solutions strategy can seriously backfire in times of severe crises. The massive economic shock wave brought on by the recent COVID-19 pandemic challenges some of the presumed advantages of business-to-business customer solutions and reveals downsides of these complex offerings to which academics and managers alike may have given insufficient attention. This editorial focuses on goods-centered companies' recent foray into the solution business and the pressing managerial questions regarding the evolution of solutions as the world begins to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the key characteristics of solution offerings, we identify seven potential downsides of customer solutions that are revealed by the current global crisis and develop promising research avenues mirroring these challenges. In each area, we propose three illustrative sets of research questions that may guide scholars and provide insights to practitioners for positioning solution businesses in the post-COVID-19 next-normal world.","['COVID-19 pandemic', 'customer solutions', 'performance-based contracting', 'servitizationCAPABILITIES', 'OFFERINGS', 'SERVICES']","['covid 19 pandemic', 'covid 19 pandemic', 'covid 19 pandemic', 'customer solutions', 'customer solutions', 'offerings']",customer solutions global crisis
"This paper explores the interplay between product market, strategic factor market, and resource development. More competition in the product market makes resource buyers bid higher for resources, as the value of trying to preempt the resources is higher. Holding other initial conditions constant, resources are developed more in industries with factor markets than in industries without. When buyers of resources cannot integrate more than one resource, developers choose to develop either at a low or high level, generating a type of heterogeneity that would not arise otherwise. Changes in the intensity of competition in the product market can have the opposite effect on resource development efforts depending on the presence or absence of factor markets.

"Interorganizational new product development (NPD) teams with business customers are rapidly becoming more prevalent; yet the drivers of such cooperations at the team level remain unclear to practitioners and researchers alike. This study proposes an input-process-output model in which various characteristics of interorganizational teams affect NPD team effectiveness through the mediating construct of NPD team cooperation. Furthermore, various moderators, reflecting the supplier's dependence on the customers (customer power and customer participation) and the supplier's environmental uncertainty (market dynamism and technological turbulence), affect the strength of the underlying relationships. The results show that customer power positively affects the relationship between intrapersonal team characteristics and team cooperation. In addition, a negative moderation occurs in interpersonal characteristics. Customer participation exhibits opposing moderating effects. Regarding the supplier's environmental uncertainty, market dynamism and technological turbulence strengthen the relationships under consideration.","['nanPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAMS', 'RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'SUPPLIER INTEGRATION', 'TASK INTERDEPENDENCE', 'INNOVATIVE BEHAVIOR', 'JOB DEMANDS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'BOUNDARY', 'MARKET']",['market'],new product development npd teams model uncertainty
"This study explored the effects of social capital, measured both absolutely and relatively, on CEO-compensation in a sample of 61 CEOcompensation committee chairperson dyads. We controlled for variables representing economic, social comparison, and other social influence explanations for CEO compensation. Social similarity did not influence pay, but a chair's absolute social capital and a CEO's social capital relative to his or her chair's significantly increased CEO compensation. The potential of social capital explanations to increase understanding of the executive wage-setting process beyond that derived from simple economic theories is discussed.","['nanEXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS', 'NETWORK STRUCTURE', 'POWER', 'PAY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MARKET', 'ELITE', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'PERCEPTIONS']",['pay'],ceo compensation
"In December 1992, the Cadbury Committee published their Code of Best Practice. The recommendations, which largely reflected perceived best practice at the time, included separating the roles of CEO and chairman, having a minimum of three non-executive directors on the board and the formulation of audit committees. The Code also advocated that a more active role be taken by institutional investors in the promotion of good practice in corporate governance. This paper discusses how agency problems may be (partially) resolved by corporate governance, reviews the evidence on compliance with the Cadbury Code and examines the relationship between board structure and firm performance, looking for evidence that the Code has enhanced board performance. While there is no empirical evidence of an association between board structure and firm value, there is some evidence that compliance with the Cadbury recommendations enhances board oversight with respect to the manipulation of accounting numbers and the discipline of the top executive.","['nanSHAREHOLDER WEALTH', 'EQUITY OWNERSHIP', 'MARKET VALUATION', 'AGENCY COSTS', 'BOARD', 'FIRM', 'DIRECTORS', 'COMPENSATION', 'DETERMINANTS', 'REVOLUTION']","['board', 'firm', 'directors']",directors institutional investors performance
"Existing international product diffusion studies have identified economic and cultural factors that influence consumers' acceptance of new products, but they have not fully examined these factors' roles in the international diffusion of global cultural products. The authors examine country-level economic and cultural factors that influence consumers' acceptance of new global cultural products across countries. Using 846 recent U.S. movies' box office performances in 48 national markets as the empirical context, the authors obtain the following key novel findings on product sales: (1) an inverse U-shaped impact of economic development status, (2) a positive impact of the cultural compatibility of the product and the market, and (3) a U-shaped impact of intercountry cultural distance in the presence of cultural compatibility and a decreasing linear impact of cultural distance in the absence of cultural compatibility.","['global product', 'consumer culture', 'text mining', 'movieINTERNATIONAL MARKETING STANDARDIZATION', 'MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY', 'NATIONAL CULTURE', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGY FIT', 'ENTRY MODE', 'HONG-KONG', 'REVIEWS', 'CONSUMERS', 'CHOICE']",['consumers'],diffusion performances
"The authors present empirical evidence of how family ownership and control affect the demand for audit quality measured by audit firm size in a sample of small private firms. The results indicate that family-held or -controlled firms are less likely to use Big 4 auditors than nonfamily firms and that an increase in family ownership decreases the likelihood of a Big 4 audit. The results imply that the less concentrated family ownership is, the more need there is for outside control mechanisms because of higher agency costs. The results imply that family influence increases firms' incentives to employ Big 4 audit firms, thereby increasing the credibility of their financial statements vis-A-vis outside stakeholders.","['auditing', 'audit quality', 'family firms', 'agency costsAGENCY COSTS', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS', 'OWNERSHIP', 'DEMAND', 'ASSOCIATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'REPUTATION', 'AUDITORS', 'DEBT']","['audit quality', 'audit quality', 'family firms', 'family firms', 'ownership', 'demand', 'auditors']",costs

"Countries compete intensely for foreign direct investment (FDI) and perform a wide range of activities to attract it. Research on FDI promotion often overlooks the effects of advertising. To fill this gap in the literature, this study analyzes the content of FDI advertising to explain its structure. To guide the analysis, the authors use Dunning's FDI location advantages framework. This framework represents an effective prism through which to view FDI advertising, and Dunning's location advantages are reflected in advertising content. In an effort to shed more light on FDI advertising, the authors first provide an assessment of how advertising content varies by country income classification. Next, using exploratory factor analysis, they identify the five factors represented in FDI advertising: knowledge resources, market attractiveness, economic governance, infrastructure, and natural resources. The findings suggest that high-income countries tend to focus on knowledge resources, while lower-middle-income countries focus on economic governance. Upper-middle-income countries tap into both knowledge resources and economic governance while also promoting the attractiveness of their market.","['advertising', 'foreign direct investment', 'eclectic theory (OLI)', 'FDI promotion', 'content analysisINDEX']","['advertising', 'foreign direct investment', 'foreign direct investment', 'foreign direct investment', 'fdi promotion', 'fdi promotion']",location advantages knowledge

The objective of the research is to ascertain whether, during the evolution of marketing in a transition to a free market, firms exhibit similar behaviors observed in well-established free-market economies. Structured interviews were conducted with 200 owner/managers of Russian firms. Structural equation modeling was used to test whether environmental turbulence results in a change in marketing orientation, ensuing use of marketing strategies, and improved firm performance. Although the model generally followed Western trends, there were important differences in the effectiveness of pricing and promotional strategies.","['nanPERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIP', 'STRATEGIC TYPES', 'ENVIRONMENT', 'FRAMEWORK', 'MILES']",['environment'],russian modeling orientation
"Sales growth and employment growth are the two most widely used growth indicators for new ventures; yet, sales growth and employment growth are not interchangeable measures of new venture growth. Rather, they are related, but somewhat independent constructs that respond differently to a variety of criteria. Most of the literature treats this as a methodological technicality. However, sales growth with or without accompanying employment growth has very different implications for managers and policy makers. A better understanding of what drives these different growth metrics has the potential to lead to better decision making. To improve that understanding we apply transaction cost economics reasoning to predict when sales growth will be or will not be accompanied by employment growth. Our results indicate that our predictions are borne out consistently in resource-constrained contexts but not in resource-munificent contexts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

"Purpose - With the function of reconstructing and promoting traditional industries in China, logistic service industry (LSI) still consumes a great deal of energy. The purpose of this paper is to empirically analyse the relationship between energy consumption of logistics and its influential factors in China, and through this, identify the most important factor and give a significant research of this factor afterwards. Design/methodology/approach - Using a quantitative analysis of the industry composition of energy consumption and the structure of energy consumption in LSI, the serious condition of China's energy conservation of LSI was found. Correlated analysis and co-integration analysis were adopted to identify how these factors affected the energy conservation of LSI and how to construct environmental logistics in China. Findings - The paper found mileage traveled by train is the most important factor of energy consumption in LSI, while traveling miles of highway is the second. The former was negative correlation with the total of energy consumption while the latter was positive correlation. Research limitations/implications - Because of the deficiency of data in China, this research is based on the data of 30 years, which is not testified as long enough for this research. This would indicate that the conclusions of this paper are approximate values. A closer look should be taken at the effectiveness of some of the other factors suggested in the previous research on this topic. Practical implications - The paper outlines ways to effectively construct environmental logistics in China which would promote the energy conservation and sustainable development of this country. Since the total consumption of energy in China accounts for a certain proportion of the world, this will benefit other countries as well. Originality/value - This paper is one of the first of its kind to develop and empirically analyze the relationship between energy consumption of LSI and its influential factors in China. It uniquely contributes towards helping us find approaches to constructing China's environmental logistics and will have far-reaching implications for other developing countries.","['Logistic service industry', 'Energy conservation', 'Energy consumption', 'Correlated analysis', 'Co-integration analysis', 'ChinaENERGY EFFICIENCY', 'DECOMPOSITION', 'SECTOR', 'INDEX']","['logistic service industry', 'logistic service industry', 'logistic service industry', 'energy conservation', 'energy conservation', 'energy consumption', 'energy consumption', 'correlated analysis', 'correlated analysis', 'co integration analysis', 'co integration analysis', 'co integration analysis']",energy consumption
"National institutions shape the ability of civil society and minority shareholders to monitor and influence decision-makers in listed state owned enterprises (SOEs), and thereby their strategies of internationalization. We argue that the weaker are such controls, the more likely such decision makers pursue self-serving motives, and thus shy away from international investment. Listed SOEs' strategies will thus be more similar to those of wholly privately owned enterprises (POEs) when these controls are more effective. Building on Williamson's (2000) hierarchy of institutions, we examine how home country institutions exerting normative, regulatory, and governance-related controls affect the comparative internationalization levels of listed SOEs and POEs. Based on a matched sample of 153 majority state owned and 153 wholly privately owned listed firms from 40 different countries, we confirm that, when home country institutions enable effective control, the internationalization strategies of listed SOEs and POEs converge.

"This article introduces the reader to organizational neuroscience, an emerging area of scholarly dialogue that explores the implications of brain science for workplace behavior. The authors begin by discussing how going inside the brain adds new levels of analysis that can advance and connect theories of organizational behavior. They then present three concrete examples of what an organizational neuroscience perspective can achieve by extending current theory, providing new research directions, and resolving ongoing theoretical debates. Last, the authors address a number of deeper metatheoretical questions raised by neuroscience, concluding that it brings new insights that will force scholars to rethink their concept of human nature.","['neuroscience', 'attitudes', 'emotion', 'justice', 'levels of analysisCOGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE', 'BEHAVIORAL-GENETICS', 'EMOTIONAL CONTAGION', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'MIRROR SYSTEM', 'MOOD LINKAGE', 'IMPLICIT', 'JUSTICE', 'WORK', 'MODEL']","['neuroscience', 'work']",organizational neuroscience
"This paper investigates the effect of corporate globalization on bank loan contracts, as reflected in both price and non-price loan terms. We show that globally diversified firms receive more favorable valuation from creditors than domestic firms do. Specifically, we find strong evidence that global firms are charged lower loan rates, and are spared the more restrictive non-price contractual terms such as short maturity and collateral requirements. Our results are robust to various extensions, including controlling for firms' endogenous choice of globalization, recognizing the joint determination of loan terms, and using alternative measures of global diversification. Our study contributes to the international business literature as the first comprehensive investigation of how global diversification affects bank lending.

"In four experiments, we show that goals associated with approach and avoidance needs influence persuasion and that the accessibility of distinct self-views moderates these effects. Specifically, individuals with an accessible independent self-view are more persuaded by promotion-focused information that is consistent with an approach goal. In contrast, individuals whose interdependent self-view is more accessible are more persuaded by prevention focused information that is consistent with an avoidance goal. When the persuasive appeal is compatible with self-regulatory focus, individuals demonstrate greater recall of the message content and are more discerning regarding argument strength. These findings provide convergent evidence that central processing under goal compatible conditions underlies the persuasion effects.","['nanCULTURE', 'CHOICE', 'FOCUS', 'NEED', 'CONSTRUALS', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'COGNITION', 'RESPONSES', 'APPEALS']","['focus', 'need']",accessibility prevention recall
"Using data from Renrendai, one of the largest peer-to-peer (P2P) lending marketplaces in China, we found an asymmetric relationship between the borrowing rates and the default risks of borrowers; specifically, orders with the same interest rate may have different default risks. A counterintuitive result is that the higher a borrower's income, the greater the default risk. Furthermore, it is found that investors may be ignorant of the relationship between certain information (income, age, education, etc.) of the borrowers and the default risk, but they pay more attention to borrower creditworthiness, loan amount, and loan term, which turn out to be the key factors in borrowers' default risks; because they have a good knowledge of the relationship between these three pieces of information and the default risk, investors are able to identify default risk. Finally, we find that investors can learn to identify default risk.","['Interest rate', 'default risk', 'financial asymmetry', 'risk identification', 'P2P lendingINFORMATION', 'CREDIT', 'NETWORKS', 'TRUST']","['interest rate', 'interest rate', 'default risk', 'default risk', 'credit']",default risks

"International animosity significantly affects the purchase of foreign products. However, domestic conflicts are also rampant in many countries, giving rise to similar issues. October 2000 marked the beginning of the second Arab Intifada (uprising) in Israel. In contrast to the first Intifada of the late 1980s and early 1990s, this time, Israeli Arabs joined the Palestinians in violent demonstrations in Israeli locations with large Arab concentrations. This research studies Jewish Israelis' reactions to Arab Israelis in the context of purchases and consumption of products and services produced or marketed by Arab Israelis, It examines animosity, its antecedents, and its consumption consequences within the large Jewish majority of the population in Israel. The authors find that dogmatism, nationalism, and internationalism affect animosity, which in turn predicts willingness to buy and actual changes in purchase behavior for goods and services produced or marketed by Israeli Arabs.

"In this paper, we hypothesize that acquisitions undertaken during low market cycles will exhibit better performance than other acquisitions for two key reasons: lower likelihood of overpayment due to hubris and ease in implementing restructuring initiatives such as retrenchment.

Based on an analysis of 115 acquisitions by Singapore firms between 1990 and 1999, we find strong support for the hypothesized relationship.

"In two experiments, the authors test rival theses regarding the effects of smoking in feature films on youths and the ability of antismoking advertising to nullify those effects. Eight hundred ninth graders watched either original movie footage with smoking or control footage with the smoking edited out. Emotional reactions were recorded during viewing, and smoking-related thoughts, beliefs, and intent were assessed afterward. The findings support the Forbidden Fruit thesis, in that smoking (versus nonsmoking) scenes positively aroused the young viewers, enhanced their perceptions of smokers' social stature, and increased their intent to smoke. However, youths' opinions were malleable, and showing them an antismoking advertisement before the film effectively repositioned the smoking from forbidden to tainted, thereby nullifying the aforementioned effects, No support was obtained for the Excitation Transfer theory, which predicts that the positive arousal evoked by movie scenes would transfer to smokers who were depicted in those scenes. The authors discuss policy implications for film content and antismoking advertising.","['nanTELEVISION VIOLENCE', 'CIGARETTE-SMOKING', 'MESSAGES', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'CONSUMPTION', 'INTENTIONS', 'CHILDREN', 'SMOKERS', 'LEISURE', 'MEDIA']",['smokers'],
"Ambidexterity research has noted that firms' simultaneous pursuit of exploration and exploitation causes organizational tensions that are difficult to resolve. To make these tensions manageable, scholars have generally suggested that senior managers take the central role in designing organizational solutions, such as the structural separation or contextual integration of the exploratory and exploitative tasks. Yet, in an inductive study of ten corporate innovation initiatives, we find that our informants assigned far less importance to the senior managers' initial design choices than to the frontline managers' subsequent configurational practices. Frontline managers used these practices to constantly adapt and align their initiatives' organizational contexts, which allowed them to cope with persistent exploration-exploitation tensions in their daily business activities. Based on these empirical insights and drawing on paradox theory, we develop a configurational perspective on ambidexterity, where frontline managers play a more central, proactive, and strategic role than purported by the established design perspective on ambidexterity.","['ambidexterity', 'exploitation', 'exploration', 'frontline managers', 'organization design', 'organizational paradox', 'qualitative researchORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY', 'EXPLOITATION', 'EXPLORATION', 'FIRMS', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'INNOVATION', 'MODEL', 'EVOLUTIONARY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'PARADOX']","['ambidexterity', 'exploitation', 'exploration', 'frontline managers', 'frontline managers', 'exploitation', 'exploration', 'firms', 'innovation', 'paradox']",ambidexterity exploration exploitation paradox theory
"Examination of the management literature on benchmarking reveals that the concept conveys a mixed metaphor. While collaboration among benchmarking partners is advocated, description of benchmarking practice is dominated by principles and language that convey notions of competition. The 'competitive' approach to benchmarking is due to four narrow, constricting assumptions: (1) that the motivation behind benchmarking is to improve and reduce a performance gap relative to some superior comparison other, (2) that benchmarking is a formal, organizationally sanctioned means of competing with others, including partners, (3) that benchmarking involves comparison through measurement or marking, and (4) that benchmarking is an activity initiated (and assessable) by one party. Two opposing concepts of benchmarking (as competition) and benchmarking (as collaboration) are introduced to develop a model for predicting the degree of competition and/or collaboration involved in relationships between benchmarking parties. Key factors within this model include context, activities, partnership and outcomes.","['nanSUPERIOR PERFORMANCE', 'GAME-THEORY', 'INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS', 'TOTAL QUALITY', 'SEARCH', 'MANAGEMENT', 'INDUSTRY', 'LEAD', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'ORGANIZATIONS']",['management'],benchmarking performance
"Building on upper echelon theory and strategic process theory, this article analyzes the relationship between ambidexterity-oriented decisions and innovative ambidexterity. While ambidexterity-oriented decisions embrace the capability of top management teams to manage contradictory strategic directions, namely adaptability and alignment, innovative ambidexterity captures the ability of firms to simultaneously develop discontinuous and incremental innovations. In addition to the direct relationship between ambidexterity-oriented decisions and innovative ambidexterity, it is argued that innovation orientation and cost orientation denote two cultural implementation mechanisms that mediate this effect. Using two top-executive data sets collected in the United States (n=83) and India (n=78), the empirical analysis shows that innovation orientation and cost orientation partially mediate the direct influence of ambidexterity-oriented decisions on innovative ambidexterity, thus further explaining how formulated decisions made by the top management team nurture ambidextrous innovation behavior. Hence, this article extends prior literature that emphasizes a positive influence of top managers on innovation through incorporating an organizational ambidexterity perspective. Second, this study contributes to ambidexterity literature through integrating strategic process theory. While ambidexterity-oriented decisions primarily relate to strategy formulation, innovation orientation and cost orientation are associated with strategy implementation. The results show that both strategic subprocesses are vital in enabling ambidextrous innovation behavior. Third, an operationalization for the ability of top management to balance adaptability- and alignment-oriented decisions is provided based on prior literature.","['nanPARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION', 'EXPLORATORY INNOVATION', 'BUSINESS STRATEGY', 'PERFORMANCE']","['top management', 'top management', 'organizational ambidexterity', 'organizational ambidexterity']",management
"A parsimonious framework linking advertising expenditures and research and development expenditures to brand value, and brand value in turn to firm-level financial performance, was proposed and empirically investigated under four data conditions: data form, brand type, financial performance metric, and lag structure. Using pooled data from 125 firms (848 firm-year observations) over the period 1991-2007, 108 path analyses were conducted to compute five path model output metrics. Data on these metrics were then compared for each of the data conditions by means of analysis of variance. Although significant relationships were generally observed among framework variables, study results differed considerably across three of the four data conditions. The principal take-away from the study is that the impact of marketing activities on firm-level financial performance is likely to be in large part a function of the specific research purpose and methodology employed. As such, the take-away has implications when interpreting value-relevance findings, when constructing theories involving market-based assets, and when designing studies to investigate relationships between marketing and financial performance.","['Advertising expenditures', 'R&D expenditures', 'Brand value', 'Firm-level financial performanceSHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'VALUE-RELEVANCE', 'VALUE CREATION', 'MARKET VALUE', 'INFORMATION', 'VALUATION', 'STRATEGY', 'CAPITALIZATION', 'AMORTIZATION', 'PRODUCTIVITY']","['advertising expenditures', 'advertising expenditures', 'brand value', 'brand value', 'value relevance', 'value relevance']",brand firm performance model

Competition had the expected U-shaped relation with creativity in open (membership change) groups but failed to produce the hypothesized inverted U-shaped pattern in closed (no membership change) groups. In the latter, effects were positive for low to intermediate competition and flat for intermediate to high levels.

"The question of how leaders' expressions of anger influence their effectiveness has long intrigued researchers and practitioners. Drawing on emotions as social information theory, we suggest the effects of leaders' expressions of anger depend on both the type of violation about which anger is expressed and the type of leader who expresses it. We test this in a series of studies using experimental and field methods. Study 1 shows that a leader's anger expression in response to followers' integrity-based violations enhances observers' perceptions of leader effectiveness, whereas anger in response to followers' competence-based violations diminishes observers' perceptions of leader effectiveness. Study 2 shows that these divergent effects occur because anger in response to integrity-based violations elicits beneficial inferential reactions among followers who observed the anger, whereas anger in response to competence-based violations provokes harmful affective reactions. Study 3 demonstrates that the negative effects of anger expressed toward competence-based violations are exacerbated, and positive effects of anger expressed toward integrity-based violations weakened, when a leader is perceived as abusive. These findings help reconcile divergent perspectives on the effects of leader anger expression, suggesting that anger can enhance perceived leader effectiveness when expressed in the right situation and by the right person.","['nanNEGATIVE EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION', 'FOLLOWER PERFORMANCE', 'ETHICAL LEADERSHIP', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'WORK', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'INFORMATION', 'DISPLAYS', 'IMPACT', 'MODEL']",['information'],competence
"Efforts to incorporate external feedback are central to the process of entrepreneurship and to that of creative work more broadly, yet, because individuals may view aspects of their creative ideas as linked to their self-concepts, this can trigger resistance toward revision. Thus, feedback-induced change, while likely intended to increase the viability of creative ideas, might paradoxically undermine that viability by compromising creative workers' associated identity-based relationships with their creative endeavors. While existing scholarship has established the importance of creative revision, research has largely overlooked how this vital process intersects with creative workers' identities. Through a field study of 59 founders and their entrepreneurial ideas, I present an identity-based process model of creative revision that highlights differences in founders' psychological ownership of their ideas and how those differences affect subsequent revision efforts. The emerging findings contribute to existing theory by revealing that the capacity to extend the novelty and usefulness of one's ideas is not merely subject to informational constraints but also to identity-based constraints.","['nanPSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP', 'CREATIVITY', 'MANAGEMENT', 'COLLABORATION', 'INNOVATION', 'STATE', 'SELF']",['self'],work self
"Emerging markets experience institutional and social changes over time that present different stakeholder expectations for multinational corporations (MNCs). MNCs are often accused of social misdeeds and experience public crises during the changes, leaving questions on how they adapt to the local social transition to sustain operations. Conventional adaptation strategies put too much emphasis on maximizing economic returns by arbitraging national differences and catering to local market and consumer characteristics. The economic orientation may fail to address evolving and diverse stakeholder expectations, easily leading to public crises. This study conceptualizes economic adaptation and social adaptation as two sets of knowledge and capabilities that would have equally important impacts on MNCs' sustainable operations in emerging markets. The empirical testing examines consumer rights-related public crises experienced by 180 MNCs in China. The results suggest that MNCs' social adaptation activities have significantly positive effects in mitigating public crises while certain aspects of economic adaption, such as early entry into China, reliance on local leadership, and speedy expansion of local employees, lead to public crises. The significant interaction effects confirm that MNCs need to follow a balanced approach, paying attention to both economic and social components to avoid public crises and sustain growth in emerging markets.","['multinational corporations (MNCs) and enterprises (MNEs)', 'emerging markets/countries/economies', 'public crisis', 'stakeholder environment', 'social adaptation', 'event history analysisFIRM PERFORMANCE', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'CHINA', 'ENTRY', 'RESPONSIBILITY', 'BUSINESS', 'ENTERPRISES', 'ECONOMICS', 'IMPACT', 'ETHICS']","['social adaptation', 'social adaptation', 'china', 'entry', 'impact']",emerging transition adaptation strategies economic orientation knowledge

Following the key tenets of real options theory, we propose that, under a high level of market uncertainty, MNEs choose more flexible (rather than more committed) ownership strategies that allow adjustment of investment decisions in future We further suggest that using flexible strategies in response to uncertainty becomes less valuable for MNEs when the industry they enter in the host country enjoys strong sales growth potential, requires less irreversible investments, and has intense competition Empirically, we analyze the ownership strategies (ownership structure and equity share) of over 5000 new foreign investments in manufacturing industries in China during 2000-2006 We find qualified support for our hypotheses, and discuss the industry boundary conditions of adopting flexible ownership strategies in foreign market entries Journal of International Business Studies (201 0) 41, 1550-1571 doi 10 1057/jibs 2010 25","['uncertainty', 'ownership', 'strategy', 'real options', 'flexibility', 'commitment', 'ChinaENTRY MODE CHOICE', 'INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES', 'FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'TRANSACTION COSTS THEORY', 'REAL OPTIONS', 'UNCERTAINTY', 'MARKET', 'IMPACT', 'GROWTH', 'SUBSIDIARIES']","['uncertainty', 'ownership', 'real options', 'real options', 'real options', 'real options', 'uncertainty', 'market', 'growth']",multinational enterprises real options
"We argue that the implications of the recursivity of language largely have been overlooked in the literature exploring the role of language in organizing. Exploiting a narrative interpretation of sensemaking in language, we illustrate how the metaconversation is constituted, showing how it simultaneously admits and reconstructs the local conversations of the organization into an encompassing conversation, where the identity of the organization as a whole is generated continually. The central process at work is the production of a metanarrative that enfolds and transcends the narratives of the communities composing an organization.","['nanSTORYTELLING ORGANIZATION', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'CONVERSATION', 'NARRATIVES', 'STORIES']","['conversation', 'narratives']",work
"The study examines whether the emergence of automated retailing systems is associated with a perceived depersonalization of the retail transaction and the consumer's evaluation of the shopping experience. It specifically addresses the role that retailing establishments play as a source of social contact, especially for those individuals categorized as lonely. The issue of loneliness is discussed and the role of store personnel as a preventive or mitigator resource is assessed. Results show that lonely and nonlonely subjects have different perceptions and are differentially affected by automated new technologies. In view of the importance of retail contact to some consumers, retailers need to be sensitive to the possible adverse effects of automation on their clientele. Implications of the impact of emerging technologies on retailers are discussed.","['nanSHOPPING ORIENTATIONS', 'LONELINESS']",['loneliness'],impact

"This study focuses on the perceived utilitarian value of a new service delivery mode, the mobile channel. The authors develop a framework that incorporates three mode-specific benefits - time convenience, user control, and service compatibility - as well as two costs - perceived risk and cognitive effort - as antecedents of perceived value. Because of the pervasiveness of time criticality as a value-added characteristic of the mobile channel, they also investigate the moderating influence of consumers' time consciousness. They empirically investigate the model using mobile brokerage services as an illustrative application. The results reveal that the identified antecedents, with the exception of service compatibility, have a strong impact on mobile channel value perceptions, which in turn influence behavioral intentions. The authors also find that time consciousness moderates the aforementioned relationships. (C) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Internet deception threatens the sustainability of Internet commerce because it undermines trust. This paper investigates the deceptive tactics available on the Internet and some of the factors that make them more or less likely to be adopted. An established theory of deception is applied to the Internet context to identify the deception tactics available on-line. The theory is then expanded with new hypotheses that link the selection of a specific tactic to the identity of the target and the purported identity of the deceiver. Content analysis of a broad range of documentary evidence published between 1995 and 2000 is used to build a database of 201 cases of Internet deception. Data from the database are used to test the hypotheses. The results suggest that deceivers select tactics as a function of their targets as well as their own purported identities. Practical implications for deterrence, prevention, and detection of Internet deception are discussed.","['Internet deception', 'Internet fraud', 'computer crime', 'electronic commerce', 'information securityPLANNED BEHAVIOR', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'FRAUD', 'SYSTEMS', 'TRUST', 'PERFORMANCE', 'RISK']","['internet deception', 'internet deception', 'trust']",internet deception
"This study explores the hybridization of field-level logics, a process that integrates previously incompatible logics within an organizational field. Through an inductive study of the wind energy field in Colorado, we find that logic hybridization resulted when social movement organizations (SMOs), electric utility firms, hybrid organizations, and policy makers variously responded to incompatibility between economizing and ecologizing logics. After compromise with electric utilities and efforts to justify wind power in economic terms failed to reduce the dominance of the economizing logic, SMOs switched tactics to promote the ecologizing logic. Once SMOs succeeded in altering the balance of power in the field, hybrid organizations then emerged to legitimize a new set of frames, practices, and arrangements that integrated the previously incompatible logics. Electric utility firms and policy makers then formalized and embedded the new hybridized logic in the field. Our findings suggest that the hybridization of field-level logics is a complex process in which organizational actions and field-level conditions recursively influence each other over time. This process is critical to understanding how entrepreneurs, firms, policy makers, and SMOs each contribute to the emergence of environmentally relevant sectors.","['nanINSTITUTIONAL LOGICS', 'SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL FIELD', 'COMPETING LOGICS', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'INDUSTRY', 'CREATION', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'MANAGEMENT']","['organizational field', 'organizational field']",firms
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyse a case of local freight stakeholder involvement to plan and design eco-efficient city logistics innovations in Como, a small city in Italy. While the importance of a well-functioning urban goods distribution system is widely acknowledged, city authorities have become increasingly aware of the need to minimise the negative impacts associated to the system. There are now countless examples of attempts to increase the eco-efficiency of urban freight deliveries; however, very few have made a notable impact. The success of such schemes often depends upon the response of a range of private sector freight stakeholders and their involvement during the planning process of these solutions is crucial. Design/methodology/approach - To engage local freight stakeholders within the planning process of a city logistics project, the logical framework approach, in the form of the design and monitoring framework (DMF) developed by the Asian Development Bank, has been applied. Findings - The structured consultation process implied within the DMF approach allowed urban freight stakeholders to share their aspirations from the beginning of the city freight planning process, despite their differences in priorities in adopting eco-efficient logistics innovations. The process ensured that city stakeholders accepted and committed to the city logistics strategies formulated during the consultation process, namely: changes to the Limited Traffic Zone regulation, the use of an urban consolidation centre and hybrid electric truck adoption. Research limitations/implications - The evaluation of the DMF application will be definitive after the demonstration/implementation stage of the city logistics project. It will then become clear if freight stakeholders have committed to the project and if it is effective in delivering the expected outputs and outcomes. Practical implications - Local city authorities may find this method useful in situations where a structured consultation process is needed for addressing urban freight issues. This is especially the case in the context of introducing innovative, eco-efficiency solutions. Originality/value - The application of DMF in the developed environment can be considered novel; this paper extends this with an application to the promotion of sustainable urban freight.","['City logistics', 'Design and monitoring framework', 'Logical framework approach', 'Public consultation process', 'Urban freightFREIGHT TRANSPORT', 'MANAGEMENT', 'OPERATIONS', 'GOODS']","['city logistics', 'city logistics', 'design and monitoring framework', 'design and monitoring framework', 'design and monitoring framework', 'design and monitoring framework', 'logical framework approach', 'logical framework approach', 'logical framework approach', 'goods']",strategies
"Studies have employed various performance measures to determine the effect of virtual brand community (VBC) participation on customer values. However, different single-factor measures usually lead to conflicting results. This study proposes an overall participation performance measure, VBC participation performance, which follows a holistic-view definition of customer values, including frequency of customer visit, purchase frequency, purchase expenditure, and word-of-mouth frequency, obtain from the overall community activities, and it is evaluated through data envelopment analysis (DEA). We further determine the effect of the customer's gender, age, tenure, and interactions on VBC participation performance by using Tobit regression models. The results show that our proposed measure outperforms either single-factor measures or measures based on other multicriteria decision analyses. Our findings also reveal that VBC is less efficient for females and customers with long tenure, and the effect of gender difference on VBC participation performance will be more (less) significant with increasing age (tenure). The findings extend existing research by suggesting an overall participation performance measure in VBC and providing insights on customer heterogeneity in the efficacy of VBC participation. This study also offers actionable recommendations for managers in term of customer segmentation and VBC design.","['Community participation', 'customer heterogeneity', 'data envelopment analysis', 'online communities', 'virtual brand community', 'Tobit regressionDATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS', 'INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY', 'GENDER-DIFFERENCES', 'CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK', 'SOCIAL-INFLUENCE', 'AGE-DIFFERENCES', 'CONSUMER', 'LOYALTY', 'DEA', 'ACCEPTANCE']","['customer heterogeneity', 'customer heterogeneity', 'data envelopment analysis', 'data envelopment analysis', 'data envelopment analysis', 'virtual brand community', 'virtual brand community', 'virtual brand community', 'dea']",virtual brand community customer values gender age
"Purpose Drawing on institutional complexity, this study aims to explore the interaction effect of formal and informal institutional forces on the adoption of green supplier collaboration (GSC) practices by Chinese manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach The paper hypothesises that the effect of the formal institutional forces on GSC in China is influenced by an informal institutional variable, guanxi, which is the interpersonal relationship between employees of the supplier and the manufacturer. To test the conceptual framework, hierarchical moderated regression analyses are conducted using multi-respondent data from 408 randomly sampled manufacturing companies in China. Findings Guanxi has a double-edged sword effect on the adoption of GSC practices. Specifically, guanxi reduces the negative impact of the perceived costs and the complexity of regulations on the adoption of GSC practices, but it also weakens the positive effect of suppliers' advice and community pressures on the adoption of GSC practices. Originality/value This study empirically examines the effect of formal and informal institutional environments on the adoption of GSC practices in emerging economies.","['Guanxi', 'Institutional theory', 'Moderating effect', 'Green supplier collaboration', 'Chinese manufacturing sector', 'Personal relationsCHAIN MANAGEMENT', 'INSTITUTIONAL PRESSURES', 'PERFORMANCE EVIDENCE', 'INTEGRATION', 'DRIVERS', 'IMPACT', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'CAPABILITIES', 'ISOMORPHISM', 'ANTECEDENTS']","['guanxi', 'green supplier collaboration', 'green supplier collaboration', 'green supplier collaboration', 'impact']",institutional complexity green supplier collaboration china guanxi

Results show that each is separately important in shaping outcomes, and their alignment toward the adoption of a new technology leads to the greatest levels of change. In addition, cognition can compensate when organization-level factors are lacking. Considering cognition, capabilities, and incentives together contributes to a more contingent view of the conditions under which CEO cognition matters for firm strategy.","['nanTOP-MANAGEMENT-TEAM', 'STRATEGIC CHANGE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL OUTCOMES', 'EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'MANAGERIAL', 'PERSISTENCE', 'EVOLUTION', 'INERTIA']",['evolution'],capabilities incentives

"This paper responds to recent interest in the role of intentionality in the internal dynamics of routines. Previous research has focused on how routine participants bring particular intentions to the performance of a routine and choose the means for accomplishing the pre-defined ends accordingly. Drawing on the pragmatist theory of action and a yearlong ethnographic study of a pharmaceutical company, we uncover emerging intentionality in routine performances. We show how the foregrounding of means within the concrete situation at hand might lead to the emergence of new ends to pursue. Moreover, we find that the emergence of new ends in routine performances might result in updating the goals for the routine and its associated patterns. With these findings, we contribute to a better understanding of the full spectrum of intentional action in routine dynamics, ranging from purposeful action (foregrounding ends) to purposive action (foregrounding means). This expanded perspective on intentionality in routine dynamics suggests a greater potential for continuous routine change than previous research has acknowledged.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL ROUTINES', 'ARTIFACTS', 'DUALISM', 'ENDS']",['ends'],theory
"We study how intra-industry product diversity affects firm performance by analyzing the implications of expanding a firm's product line within its core business. We conjecture that increases in product diversity initially undermine performance because of negative transfer effects but then improve it due to economies of scope. We further theorize that this U-shaped effect of product diversity becomes more pronounced as the firm increases the intensity of its technology investment, yet is likely to be attenuated by the firm's accumulated experience with intra-industry diversification. Data on 156 U.S.-based software firms operating from 1990 to 2001 furnish support for these conjectures. Our study advances emerging research on intra-industry diversification by underscoring some of its contingent performance effects.

"This article explores the ways that consumers use fashion discourse to inscribe their consumption behaviors in a complex ideological system of folk theories about the nature of self and society. Verbatim texts of 20 phenomenological interviews concerning consumers' perceptions and experiences of fashion are interpreted through a hermeneutic process with specific consideration given to gender issues. Whereas critics of consumer culture frequently argue that fashion discourses enshroud consumer perceptions in a common hegemonic outlook, our analysis suggests that this ideological system offers a myriad of countervailing interpretive standpoints that consumers combine, adapt, and juxtapose to fit the conditions of their everyday lives. By appropriating fashion discourse, consumers generate personalized fashion narratives and metaphoric and metonymic references that negotiate key existential tensions and that often express resistance to dominant fashion norms in their social milieu or consumer culture at large. A theoretical model is derived that portrays a dialogical relationship between consumers and this cultural system of countervailing fashion meanings. The implications of this model for future research on the meaning transfer process and the sociocognitive dimensions of consumer beliefs are discussed.","['nanCONSUMPTION', 'IMAGES', 'EXPERIENCES', 'LIFE', 'TEXT']","['experiences', 'text']",behaviors gender
"Despite widespread pro-green attitudes, consumers frequently purchase non-green alternatives. One possible explanation for this value-action gap is the tradeoffs that green products often force on their users: higher prices, lower quality, and/or reduced performance. The current study uses conjoint analysis to uncover the attribute preferences of car and TV buyers when green attributes are negatively correlated with conventional attributes. These attribute preferences are then used to predict choice among sets of green and less green alternatives currently sold in the marketplace. Strong preferences for green products are found when tradeoffs are not apparent, but preference shifts significantly to less green compromise alternatives when the actual attribute tradeoffs are considered. Although general preference is reduced by tradeoffs, a green product offering some compensatory advantage on a conventional attribute does attract a broader spectrum of consumers, while only dark green consumers are willing to pay the price to go green when the product offers few compensatory qualities. In all cases, however, predicted buyers of the greenest technologies offset some of their environmental benefits by choosing more energy-thirsty specifications on negatively correlated conventional attributes. Managerial and public policy implications of the findings are then discussed.","['Value-action gap', 'Negative attribute correlations', 'Green product adoption', 'Sustainability', 'Rebound effectsCONSUMPTION', 'CONSUMERS', 'BEHAVIORS', 'ATTITUDES']","['value action gap', 'value action gap', 'value action gap', 'consumers', 'attitudes']",conjoint analysis choice
"This study examines the dynamics of consumer-brand identification (CBI) and its antecedents in the context of the launch of a new brand. Three focal drivers of CBI with a new brand are examined, namely: perceived quality (the instrumental driver), self-brand congruity (the symbolic driver), and consumer innate innovativeness (a trait-based driver). Using longitudinal survey data, the authors find that on average, CBI growth trajectories initially rise after the introduction but eventually decline, following an inverted-U shape. More importantly, the longitudinal effects of the antecedents suggest that CBI can take different paths. Consumer innovativeness creates a fleeting identification with the brand that dissipates over time. On the other hand, company-controlled drivers of CBI-such as brand positioning-can contribute to the build-up of deep-structure CBI that grows stronger over time. Based on these findings, the authors offer normative guidelines to managers on consumer-brand relationship investment.","['Consumer-brand identification', 'Branding', 'New products', 'Longitudinal effects of consumer traits', 'Growth modelingCOMPANY IDENTIFICATION', 'IDENTITY SALIENCE', 'SOCIAL IDENTITY', 'PRODUCT', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODEL', 'IMAGE', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'BEHAVIORS']","['consumer brand identification', 'consumer brand identification', 'consumer brand identification']",consumer brand identification perceived quality congruity innate innovativeness
"Purpose - This paper aims to explore the intellectual capital (IC) information needed to enable relationship transparency and the influences of relationship transparency on supply chain partnerships. Design/methodology/approach - A field experiment research design is adopted to examine whether IC information facilitates relationship transparency with partners in the supply chain of a focal firm and contributes to supply chain partnership enhancement. Findings - This study identifies an IC transparency framework consisting of two components the transparency of important business characteristics and the transparency of relationship atmosphere for guiding the provision of IC information and enabling relationship transparency. The provision of the focal firm's IC information to partners in its supply chain significantly increases partner's trust, satisfaction and commitment towards their relationships. Thus the results suggest that relationship transparency derived from IC transparency enhances supply chain partnerships. Relationship transparency facilitates the focal firm to develop and integrate its supply chain through improved understanding pertaining to itself and its relationships with partners in its supply chain. Thus, this transparency of the focal firm with partners constitutes a flexible and attainable alternative to managing the relationships for its supply chain. Research limitations/implications - This study suggests that the field experiment research design allows researchers to effectively observe IC transparency's influences on supply chain partnership enhancement. Practical implications - For firms increasingly interconnected with supply chain models of competition, this study proposes a practical IC transparency framework specific for guiding the provision of IC information to enable relationship transparency and enhance supply chain partnerships. Originality/value - This study combines limited research on relationship transparency with IC theories to propose an IC transparency framework for enhancing supplier relationship management and represents a first step to examining the quantitative effects of IC transparency in the context of supply chain partners.","['Relationship transparency', 'Supply chain partnership enhancement', 'Intellectual capital', 'Knowledge management', 'Field experimentMARKETING CHANNELS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MODEL', 'TRUST', 'PERFORMANCE', 'COMMITMENT', 'FRAMEWORK', 'BEHAVIOR', 'NETWORK', 'FIRM']","['relationship transparency', 'relationship transparency', 'supply chain partnership enhancement', 'supply chain partnership enhancement', 'supply chain partnership enhancement', 'supply chain partnership enhancement', 'intellectual capital', 'intellectual capital', 'management', 'model', 'trust', 'commitment', 'framework', 'firm']",relationship transparency partnerships field experiment trust
"The transfer of knowledge in alliances entails risk to partners, whose willingness to accept it presumably relies on the trustworthiness that they perceive in their partners. We investigate the extent to which the perceptions of trustworthiness and the willingness to take risk determine the transfer of knowledge between alliance partners and their ultimate impact on alliance success. The results show that the transfer of tacit versus explicit knowledge have very different trust and risk profiles. Whereas explicit knowledge is closely associated with the firm's willingness to take risk, tacit knowledge is intimately related to high trustworthiness. The results support the important role of trust and the transfer of tacit knowledge on the success of learning alliances.","['nanSTRATEGIC ALLIANCES', 'JOINT VENTURES', 'BARGAINING POWER', 'TRUST', 'FIRM', 'CAPABILITIES', 'ORGANIZATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'MODEL']","['trust', 'firm']",trustworthiness

"People can make decisions by choosing or by rejecting alternatives. This research shows that changing a task from choice to rejection makes people more likely to rely on deliberative processing, what we label the task-type effect. To demonstrate this effect, we use a set of established decision biases that can be attenuated under deliberative processing. We show that changing a task from choice to rejection makes people express more consistent preferences between safe and risky options in the Asian disease problem (study 1A) and in financial decision making (study 1B), even with real monetary consequences (study 1C). Further, switching a task from choice to rejection increases the quality of consideration sets in the context of hotel reviews (study 2) and leads to more rational decisions in the context of cell phone plan selection (study 3). Studies 4 and 5 tap into the process underlying the effect of task type. We demonstrate that a rejection task produces decisions similar to those observed in a choice task when decision makers are cognitively depleted (study 4) or encouraged to rely on their feelings (study 5).

"Using the Toulmin method, we present an epistemological analysis of Porter's Five Forces Framework (FFF) in light of the increasing evidence pertaining to the institutional context in emerging economies. The analysis reveals three key qualifiers in the theoretical structure of FFF - transaction costs, capital flows and laws governing rivalry. Evidence from emerging economies indicates that FFF's assumptions about the qualifiers are not met in these economies. Indeed, firms in these economies adopt strategies not derivable from FFF to tackle their unique institutional contexts. Our Toulmin analysis helps pinpoint the directions for further research in emerging economies. Specifically, the three qualifiers provide a meaningful way of building typologies and taxonomies to accommodate the diversity of institutional contexts and to link them to firm-level strategies. Our discussion also highlights the need to turn the spotlight on laws governing rivalry, a relatively under-explored topic in emerging economies, and the effectiveness of different network strategies.","['nanCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'ENTRY', 'PRIVATIZATION', 'STRATEGY', 'FIRM', 'PERFORMANCE', 'TRANSITION', 'PROPERTY', 'RUSSIA', 'CHOICE']",['firm'],five forces transaction costs capital flows firms

"Multiple categories of retail products suffer limited shelf life, demand uncertainty, and, in some cases, long lead times. To provide retailers with an incentive to increase the stocking quantity of such products, manufacturers may offer an option to return unsold items at wholesale or less than wholesale prices. This article extends the additive price-dependent demand model in three ways. First, partial returns are optimal for the manufacturer but do not induce higher stocking quantities compared with when the manufacturer offers no returns. Second, in terms of the effect of investment in demand-enhancing activities, when retailers invest, they set higher resale prices, but an optimal partial returns policy still does not induce higher stocking quantity, whereas when manufacturers invest, the optimal returns policy induces higher stocking quantity. Third, when the manufacturer and retailer have different expectations of demand uncertainty, the retailer's estimate influences the expected profits for both, whereas the manufacturer's estimate has a major impact on its profits only.

"Despite the growing number of longitudinal investigations of customer satisfaction, the occurrence and type of dynamic effects within satisfaction formation has not been entirely clarified. This article explores these dynamic effects on both the level of attribute and overall service satisfaction and investigates whether the halo effect that has been identified in a business-to-consumer context also emerges in business relations. The results show that in our empirical example, within-level dynamic effects dominate, whereas halo effects are weak. In light of evidence regarding nonlinear effects in satisfaction formation, this study also investigates nonlinearities. The dynamic relations in our empirical example show a positive asymmetry, meaning that favorable satisfaction evaluations have a greater propensity to carry over to the next period than do less favorable ones. Therefore, customers in the long-term business relations of this study maintain a certain tolerance toward their service provider, which limits the diagnostic power of current satisfaction ratings to detect problems in the relationship.","['customer satisfaction', 'halo effects', 'dynamic model', 'business-to-business servicesATTRIBUTE-LEVEL PERFORMANCE', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'DYNAMIC-MODEL', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'IMPACT', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'INTENTIONS', 'RETENTION', 'QUALITY', 'SHARE']","['customer satisfaction', 'customer satisfaction', 'halo effects', 'halo effects', 'customer satisfaction', 'customer satisfaction']",customer satisfaction halo effect
"This study develops the concept of Strategic Corporate Social Responsibility (Strategic CSR) by meta-analyzing the available empirical evidence on the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP). Using meta-analytic structural equation modeling on effect size data from 344 primary studies, our study documents four empirical mechanisms explaining how CSR positively affects CFP: by 1) enhancing firm reputation, 2) increasing stakeholder reciprocation, 3) mitigating firm risk, and 4) strengthening innovation capacity. We propose these four mechanisms to identify four causally relevant attributes that allow us to conceptually distinguish Strategic CSR from CSR more generally. Our findings indicate that the four mechanisms combined explain 20 per cent of the CSR-CFP relationship, suggesting that considerable room remains for future empirical research. The development of an empirically informed, causal conceptualization of Strategic CSR responds to a long-heard call for better-specified concepts in empirical CSR research.","['concept formation', 'corporate social responsibility', 'financial performance', 'meta-analysis', 'strategyCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'RESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'PROACTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT RESEARCH', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS', 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION', 'CONSTRUCT MEASUREMENT', 'ECONOMIC-PERFORMANCE']","['corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'corporate social responsibility', 'financial performance', 'financial performance', 'financial performance', 'financial performance']",corporate social responsibility csr financial performance firm reputation innovation empirical csr research

This article reviews the conceptual, methodological, and empirical insights gained from a systematic analysis of 46 studies conducted on this subject. Undoubtedly, this stream of research has enhanced understanding of the importance of managerial elements in affecting exporting activities. However, conceptually this research is still in its exploratory phase of development, lacking an integral theoretical framework. Certain methodological limitations are also identified, especially with respect to sampling designs, fieldwork procedures, and analytical methods. Empirically, hypothesized associations between managerial factors and export dimensions lead to diverse and sometimes conflicting findings, except for attributes of a general-subjective nature that demonstrate a consistently strong relationship with exporting-particularly in relation to the firm's propensity to export. The review reaches certain significant conclusions and suggests directions for future research in the field.","['nanBEHAVIOR', 'FIRM', 'PERFORMANCE']",['firm'],research exporting
"In a study of management in new product development units, Josef Frischer compared managers who primarily intend empowering subordinates for the benefit of the whole organization (managers with the leadership motive pattern) with those who essentially are concerned with the establishment and maintenance of a friendly relationship with subordinates (managers high in need for affiliation). Thirty-five managers, heading new product development functions or units in four high-technology plants, were assessed along with their subordinates. When managers exhibited a leadership motive pattern, their subordinates perceived their work groups, their managers, and themselves as more influential (empowered). They also reported a more innovative climate as compared with subordinates of managers high in need for affiliation. Beside, those in subordinate positions, who are affected by the empowering managers, are given the opportunity to successfully influence and manage the turbulence and complexity arising from the development of new products, thus helping to establish an organizational climate that supports innovative pursuits.","['nanPARTICIPATIVE MANAGEMENT', 'INNOVATION', 'POWER']",['power'],work

We report that foreign greenfield R&D activities by multinational corporations in a host country significantly affect the innovation performance of domestic firms and there exist both intra-industry and inter-industry spillovers from foreign greenfield R&D. There are only inter-industry M&A spillovers. We find that importing foreign technology and investing in domestic R&D have positive impacts on domestic innovation.

"Research on network externalities has identified a number of product categories in which the market performance of an innovation (e.g., unit sales and revenues) is an increasing function of that innovation's installed base and the availability of complementary products. Innovation scholars have attributed these findings to the positive impact of network externality variables on consumer perceptions of innovation attributes. This paper provides the first empirical examination of these perceptual linkages by extending the Technology Acceptance Model to include consumer perceptions of network externality variables. The authors hypothesize that, when direct and indirect network externalities exist, consumer purchase intentions and consumer perceptions of an innovation's usefulness and ease of use will positively reflect perceptions of installed base size and the availability of complementary products. To test this reasoning, the authors developed new measures of consumer perceptions of network externality variables. These measures were incorporated into a survey that explored the attitudes in Japan of potential adopters toward digital music (DM) players at an early stage in the product life cycle. Findings reveal a direct positive relationship between ease of use and the perceived availability of digital music. The authors also find positive and significant relationships between both purchase intention and perceived usefulness and (1) the perceived size of the DM player installed base and (2) the perceived availability of digital music. An application of the Baron-Kenny test for mediating variables reveals that (1) ease of use partially mediates the relationship between the perceived availability of digital music and perceived usefulness and (2) perceived usefulness partially mediates the relationship between the perceived availability of digital music and purchase intention. The research has important implications for future research on new product adoption and for the management of innovations that involve network externalities. The conceptual model provides a framework for testing alternative explanations of observed variations in the impact of network externalities within and across product categories. The empirical analysis provides guidance for managers who wish to manage the impact of network externalities on adoption. In addition to stimulating the size of the installed base and the variety of complementary products, executives must also manage consumer awareness of network externality variables and consumer understanding of the relationship between those variables and innovation attributes. Finally, traditional adoption models link consumer adoption decisions to perceptions of innovation attributes. The findings provided here imply that predictive accuracy of these models can be improved by including consumer perceptions of network externality variables.","['nanINFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY', 'PERCEIVED USEFULNESS', 'USER ACCEPTANCE', 'MICROCOMPUTER SOFTWARE', 'EMPIRICAL-EVALUATION', 'ADOPTION', 'PRODUCT', 'MARKET', 'COMPATIBILITY', 'SERVICES']","['perceived usefulness', 'perceived usefulness', 'adoption', 'product', 'market']",products technology acceptance model music

"The process by which managers implement marketing plans in smaller industrial organizations has yet to be conceptualized in ways that can spur theoretical development or speak to the practical realities of managers from this growing, important segment of American industry. This article, based on an exploratory study of marketing strategy processes in 50 smaller entrepreneurial organizations develops a framework to stimulate thinking and an inventory of propositions for future testing The study finds market planning and implementation inextricably linked. Marketing implementation emerges as an organization's adaptive response to day-to-day market events that is rarely scripted by plans and as a process that involves purposeful actions and improvisations as much as stop-gap actions and firefights. The nature and extent of implementation-related improvisations appear to directly affect a firm's market orientation, rate of growth, and strategic effectiveness.","['nanSTRATEGY-MAKING PROCESSES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ADAPTATION', 'CHOICE', 'MODEL', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'DETERMINISM', 'CONTINGENCY', 'ORIENTATION', 'PERSPECTIVE']",['orientation'],strategy orientation

"Extending the perspective of agency theory, this study incorporates both professional and local knowledge asymmetry into a model of relationship satisfaction between global professional service firms and their local clients. The model also includes learning orientation and adaptation that are theorized to regulate the impact of knowledge asymmetry on goal incongruence, which ultimately affects relationship satisfaction. China was selected as the setting of the study because it is the largest emerging market, has seen double-digit growth of advertising expenditures for the past two decades, and is home to many multinational advertising agencies that have increasingly pursued local clients as revenue sources. Multiple informants from 177 domestic Chinese firms and their multinational advertising agencies were personally interviewed, and the dyadic data were used to test the model. Results show that both types of knowledge asymmetry lead to goal incongruence, which causes client dissatisfaction. The role of learning orientation varies, as does the role of adaptation, in moderating the impact of knowledge asymmetry on goal incongruence and the impact of goal incongruence on relationship satisfaction. Theoretical and managerial implications of the findings are discussed, along with the limitations of the study and future research directions.

"A number of researchers in the marketing, management, and economics disciplines have expressed reservations regarding the validity and generalizability of the reported relationships between market share and profitability. Against this backdrop, the authors performed a meta-analysis on 276 market share-profitability findings from forty-eight studies to address whether market share and profitablity are positively related and to examine the factors that moderate the magnitude of that relationship. The authors found that, on average, market share has a positive effect on business profitability. However, the magnitude of the market share-profitability relationship is moderated by model specification errors, sample characteristics, and measurement characteristics. The relationship is moderated the most (and, on average, the relationship could be artifactual) when firm-specific intangible factors are specified in the profit model or the estimate of the market share-profitability relationship is based on an analysis of non-PIMS businesses. The authors discuss the implications of these results for the evaluation and utilization of market share information by managers in reference to strategies that focus on building market share as a means for increasing profits.","['nanMETA-ANALYSIS', 'BUSINESS PERFORMANCE', 'DECISION MAKERS', 'PRODUCT QUALITY', 'PATH-ANALYSIS', 'INFORMATION', 'INDUSTRY', 'CONSUMER', 'POWER', 'RISK']",['information'],market share profitability meta analysis profitablity model

"Discretion (an individual's latitude of action) is a fundamental element of work, with extensive individual and organizational consequences. Research has demonstrated the importance of discretion, but there is not yet a mature theory of discretion in organizations. Towards that end, this paper derives a multidimensional typology of discretion in organizations, integrating previous empirical results and archival interview data. It is found that discretion comprises eight distinct domains. This eight-part typology casts new light on previous findings and contributes towards a mature theory of discretion.

Responding to our critics we advance four arguments: (1) Only practitioners, not management scholars, can ultimately assess relevance of research by applying solutions derived from research results. (2) Collaborative management research whose output, in the publishing process, has to pass reviews in which criteria of rigour dominate does not necessarily generate research of higher relevance. (3) The 'body of scientific evidence' which our critics refer to contains an abundance of contradicting findings and recommendations and is therefore not of much help for practitioners.

"Applying arguments from social exchange theory, we theoretically derive and empirically test a multilevel model that informs theory on leadership, cynicism, and deviant withdrawal. Namely, we examine the moderating effect of the upward exchange relationship of a leader on empowering leadership behaviors as they affect subordinate psychological empowerment, cynicism, and time theft. In a sample of 161 employees across 37 direct supervisors, empowering leadership was associated with reduced employee cynicism both directly and indirectly through employee psychological empowerment. The positive relationship between empowering leadership and employee psychological empowerment, however, was significant only when the leader enjoyed a high-quality relationship with his or her own boss. In turn, cynicism was associated with increased time theft, suggesting that employees may reciprocate frustrating experiences by withdrawing in minor, yet impactful and deviant, ways in efforts to balance their exchange with the organization.","['leader-leader exchange', 'empowering leadership', 'psychological empowerment', 'cynicism', 'withdrawal behaviorCOUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORK BEHAVIORS', 'PERCEIVED ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT', 'MEMBER EXCHANGE', 'EMPLOYEE CYNICISM', 'SUPERVISOR SUPPORT', 'MANAGEMENT TEAMS', 'SELF-MANAGEMENT', 'EMPIRICAL-TEST', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ATTITUDES']","['empowering leadership', 'empowering leadership', 'psychological empowerment', 'psychological empowerment', 'cynicism', 'employee cynicism', 'employee cynicism']",leadership cynicism
"Service providers who are Black tend to be evaluated less favorably than those who are White, hindering opportunities for advancement. We propose that the Black-White racial disparity in service performance evaluations is due to occupational-racial stereotype incongruence for interpersonal warmth and that more emotional labor is necessary from Blacks to reduce this incongruence. A pilot study manipulating employee race and occupation confirmed warmth and person-occupation fit judgments are lower for an otherwise equal Black than White service provider. We then demonstrate the racial disparity in service performance is due to interpersonal warmth differences in an experimental study with participants evaluating videos of retail clerks (Study 1) and a multisource field study of grocery clerks with supervisor-rated judgments (Study 2). Furthermore, White service providers are rated highly regardless of emotional labor, but performing more emotional labor (i.e., amplifying positive expressions) is necessary for Black providers to increase warmth judgments and reduce the racial disparity. In other words, Black providers are held to a higher standard where they must fake it to make it in service roles. We discuss implications for stereotype fit and expectation states theory, emotional labor, and service management.","['stereotypes', 'expectation states', 'double standards', 'racial bias', 'emotional labor', 'emotion regulation', 'interpersonal warmth', 'job performance', 'customer serviceAFFECTIVE DELIVERY', 'MECHANICAL TURK', 'JOB-PERFORMANCE', 'STEREOTYPES', 'CUSTOMER', 'RACE', 'EMPLOYEE', 'SATISFACTION', 'METAANALYSIS', 'STRATEGIES']","['expectation states', 'expectation states', 'emotional labor', 'emotional labor', 'interpersonal warmth', 'interpersonal warmth', 'race', 'employee']",service black service performance emotional labor fit
"Research summary We examine how heterogeneity in customers' tendencies to single-home or multi-home affects a platform's competitive responses to new entrants in the market. We first develop a formal model to generate predictions about how a platform will respond. We then empirically test it, leveraging a historical setting: TV station entry into local U.S. newspaper markets from 1945 to 1963. A notable feature of this setting is a quasi-natural experiment: the staggered geographic and temporal rollout of TV stations that was temporarily halted during the Korean War. We find that platform firms indeed take their customers' homing tendencies into account in their responses to competition: after a TV station enters the newspaper market, newspaper firms with more single-homing consumers had lower subscription prices, circulations, and advertising rates. Managerial summary The theoretical and empirical results in our paper suggest that platform firms operating in multi-sided market settings need to consider their customers' single-homing and multi-homing tendencies. Heterogeneity in these tendencies is an important demand-side factor to consider when formulating responses to a competitor's entry.","['multi-homing', 'newspaper', 'platform responses', 'single-homing', 'television2-SIDED MARKETS', 'TRADE-OFFS', 'COMPETITION', 'TELEVISION', 'EXCLUSIVITY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ONLINE', 'IMPACT', 'POWER']","['multi homing', 'multi homing', 'newspaper', 'single homing', 'single homing', 'competition']",homing
"We examine the relationship of environmental antecedents to asset restructuring in nine French civil law countries in Latin America and Europe. In these countries, business group affiliation helps member firms to access resources, take advantage of environmental opportunities, and neutralize threats. Results indicated that environmental antecedents, such as change in country development, increased competition and deregulation led to increased asset restructuring. More importantly, however, we also found that the influence of environmental factors was moderated by business group membership. The relationship between change in country development and restructuring was stronger for group-affiliated firms and the effects of increased competition and deregulation on asset restructuring were stronger for primarily independent firms. Our study offers additional evidence that organizations may respond differently to environmental opportunities and threats depending on the institutional setting.

"Research Summary Does it pay to be a multinational? Despite decades of empirical research, we still do not know. We undertake a large-sample, cross-national replication of Lu and Beamish (2004) and Berry and Kaul's (2016) works to examine whether the multinationality-performance relationship is S-shaped in a 2009-2016 panel of 889,865 firm-year observations. Using a two-stage least squares fixed-effects model that accounts for endogeneity on a subsample of 32,835 multinationals from 64 countries, we find no evidence of an S-shaped relationship; nor do we see it in any of the single-country contexts. Our results show no evidence of any within-firm effect of multinationality on performance, highlighting the need for more contextually-grounded research focused on explaining between-firm effects to advance our theoretical and empirical understanding of the multinationality-performance relationship. Managerial Summary We replicate two studies that examined the relationship between a firm's multinationality and its performance. Lu and Beamish (2004) found evidence of an S-shaped relationship-with performance first decreasing, then increasing, then decreasing again as firms expanded abroad-in a sample of Japanese firms; Berry and Kaul (2016) found no evidence of an S-shaped pattern in a sample of U.S. multinationals. We test for the same relationship using data from nearly 250,000 firms based in over 100 countries from 2009 to 2016 and find no evidence of an S-shaped pattern or of any effect of multinationality. Our study thus adds substantial evidence to the one shown by Berry and Kaul (2016), emphasizing the need to focus on how contextual differences influence the multinationality-performance relationship.","['firm performance', 'multinationality', 'panel data', 'replication', 'S-curveFIRM PERFORMANCE', 'INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'DIVERSITY', 'DIRECTORS', 'STRATEGY', 'ENTRY']","['multinationality', 'replication']",replication model
"Human beings have always coveted beautiful objects, but the desire to look good is reaching new heights worldwide. Although the pursuit of beauty appears universal, industry evidence suggests that it is particularly strong in Asia. This research examines the effect of culture on the pursuit of beauty. Three studies provide converging evidence that interdependent self-construal increases the likelihood of using appearance-enhancing products. Study 1 operationalizes culture through nationality and self-construal and shows that Easterners (more interdependent) are more likely to use appearance-enhancing products than Westerners (less interdependent). This use is driven by interdependents' tendency to conform to societal norms, which in turn leads to heightened self-discrepancy (Study 2). The use of appearance-enhancing tools helps minimize this discrepancy. Study 3 shows that strength of norms moderates the impact of interdependence on the use of appearance-enhancing tools. When norms are loosely defined and adherence is not strictly enforced, interdependents' appearance enhancement tendency is reduced. This research offers actionable insights into the pursuit of beauty, marketing of beauty brands, policy making, and consumer well-being.","['physical attractiveness', 'culture', 'conformity', 'norms', 'self-discrepancySELF-CONSTRUALS', 'PRIVATE SELF', 'INDIVIDUALISM', 'VALUES', 'ATTRACTIVENESS', 'COLLECTIVISM', 'CONFORMITY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'DISCREPANCIES', 'CONSEQUENCES']","['culture', 'norms']",human self construal impact

"Entrepreneurs need to act under conditions of uncertainty and resource constraints to bring new, often-unrecognizable products to market and convince an unknown set of stakeholders to support their endeavours. The type of action entrepreneurs take to navigate uncertain entrepreneurial contexts is underspecified. We analysed 48 interviews with entrepreneurs to inductively identify an action-oriented construct we labelled as entrepreneurial hustle - an entrepreneur's urgent, unorthodox actions that are intended to be useful in addressing immediate challenges and opportunities under conditions of uncertainty. In a follow-up study, we use an experimental vignette approach to assess the impact of an entrepreneur's hustle on venture stakeholders. Findings suggest that entrepreneurial hustle positively influences stakeholder perceptions of the entrepreneur's leadership effectiveness and a venture's legitimacy, mediated by perceptions of the entrepreneur's ability-based trustworthiness. We conclude that entrepreneurial hustle is a fundamental behaviour that enables entrepreneurs to enrol new venture stakeholders and lead their entrepreneurial efforts.","['entrepreneurial action', 'entrepreneurial behaviour', 'entrepreneurial leadership', 'entrepreneurship', 'enrolling stakeholders', 'hustle', 'legitimacyCOGNITIVE LEGITIMACY', 'LEADERSHIP', 'MANAGEMENT', 'TRUST', 'OPPORTUNITY', 'RESILIENCE', 'CONSTRUCT', 'TRUSTWORTHINESS', 'EFFECTUATION', 'PERFORMANCE']","['hustle', 'leadership', 'trust', 'construct', 'trustworthiness']",products leadership trustworthiness

"Prior research shows that firms benefit from the social capital of their boards of directors but has not explored the antecedents of new director social capital. We argue that firms can attract directors with social capital by offering more compensation. We also argue that more complex firms (firms with a greater scale and scope of operations) are more attractive to such directors because of the greater experience and exposure that such directorships provide. Similarly, we argue that firms with high-status directors on their current boards will be more attractive to directors with social capital. We analyse the social capital of new outside directors added to boards of semiconductor firms between 1993 and 2007. Surprisingly, we find no support for the hypothesis that higher compensation is associated with adding directors with high status or board ties. However, firm complexity is associated with the ability to add new directors who have social capital, and the status of current board members is associated with the ability to add new directors who also have high status.","['nanFIRM PERFORMANCE', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'BOARD COMPOSITION', 'NETWORK TIES', 'IMPACT', 'COMPENSATION', 'DEPENDENCE', 'DETERMINANTS', 'AGENCY', 'RATIONALITY']",['compensation'],boards of directors new director
Corporate social responsibility remains an embryonic and contestable concept. This paper assesses three key approaches and offers a perspective gauging little prospect of theoretical synthesis. Ethical responsibility theory advocates strong corporate self-restraint and altruism duties and expansive public policy strengthening stakeholder rights. Economic responsibility theory advocates market wealth creation subject only to minimalist public policy and perhaps customary business ethics. These two viewpoints embed competing moral frameworks and political philosophies. Any theoretical synthesis must discover some subset of ethical principles yielding corporate competitive advantage. Corporate citizenship language invokes a political metaphor providing neither true intermediate positioning nor theoretical synthesis. Two conflicting interpretations abandon responsibility language without adopting the economic viewpoint. An instrumental citizenship interpretation expands philanthropy as a strategic lever for increasing corporate reputation and market opportunities while retaining managerial discretion. An ideal citizenship interpretation restates ethical responsibility into voluntarism language intended to influence managerial discretion concerning universal human rights.,"['nanSTAKEHOLDER THEORY', 'BUSINESS SCHOOL', 'PERFORMANCE', 'ETHICS']",['ethics'],policy
"We propose the use of eLancing as a natural environment to conduct field experiments in entrepreneurship research. eLancing, or Internet freelancing, involves millions of people around the world and consists of websites that link individuals and organizations interested in purchasing services or commissioning people to complete some type of work with individuals and organizations interested in providing such services or performing such work. We provide a description of how to conduct practically feasible field experiments using eLancing's natural environment to investigate important substantive areas such as entrepreneurial team efficacy and how execution differs from opportunity recognition, among other areas. Using eLancing to conduct field experiments allows researchers to overcome pervasive methodological challenges as revealed by a content analysis of the 175 empirical articles published in the Journal of Business Venturing from January 2005 to November 2010. Specifically, eLancing allows researchers to improve generalizability, address the omitted variables problem, improve the operationalization of constructs, improve confidence regarding the nature of causal relationships, and address other challenges such as participant bias and selective survival. Thus, using eLancing as a methodological tool has the potential to lead to important theoretical advancements and subsequent practical applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We also question why this low correlation matters given the fact that consumers use multiple sources of information, and more uncorrelated sources lead to more efficient decision making.","['online reviews', 'consumer reportsWORD-OF-MOUTH', 'PRODUCT REVIEWS', 'SALES', 'DYNAMICS', 'MARKETS']",['dynamics'],reports online consumer

"We investigate how bidding strategies of successful bidders influence the savings they derive from a Name Your Own Price (NYOP) retailer relative to buying the same product from a retailer who posts prices. Utilizing bidding data for hotel room purchases we demonstrate that consumer savings rate depends positively on consumer decision to haggle (# bids >= 3) and on the shape of the bid function. Relative to non-hagglers (# bids <= 2), hagglers who employ a constant bid increment (i.e., a linear) strategy and a decreasing bid increment (i.e., concave) strategy save more, while those who employ an increasing bid increment strategy (i.e., convex) fare no better.

"This paper reviews the empirical literature on identity work and identifies two distinct approaches to incorporating emotion. The majority of empirical studies use emotion to describe the experiences of identity work. In doing so, the authors (a) mention the emotions that people feel in situations that trigger identity work, (b) illustrate identity work as an emotional endeavour, and (c) describe the emotional impact of successful and unsuccessful identity work. There is also an emerging literature that examines the mutual constitution of emotions and identity work. These authors address emotional labour, affective social identification, emotional attachment and detachment, and humour when studying identity work. This paper suggests that, to understand better the relation between emotions and identity work, future research should examine the role of emotions in problematizing identity, the emotional constitution of the identity work experience, the intersection of emotions and other ways of knowing the self, and the links between emotions and power in identity work.","['nanCONVERSATIONAL IDENTITY', 'DISCURSIVE PRACTICES', 'SOCIAL IDENTITIES', 'SELF', 'CONSTRUCTION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'IDENTIFICATION', 'LEADERSHIP', 'BUSINESS', 'GAY']","['self', 'identification']",
"This research examines how consumers choose retailers when they are uncertain about store prices prior to shopping. Simulating everyday choice, participants made successive retailer choices where on each occasion they chose a retailer and only then learned product prices. The results of a series of studies demonstrated that participants were more likely to choose a retailer that offered an everyday low pricing strategy (EDLP) or that offered frequent small discounts over a retailer that offered infrequent large discounts. This choice advantage for the retailer that was cheaper more often manifested even when its average price was judged to be higher. The same results were obtained when choices were made a day apart, when price feedback was only given for the chosen retailer, and when price feedback was given for both retailers. Participant's expectations of future prices but not their judgments of retailer's past average prices predicted their subsequent retailer choice.","['nanPROSPECT-THEORY', 'RISKY CHOICE', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'DECISIONS', 'FREQUENCY', 'EXPERIENCE', 'JUDGMENTS', 'BEHAVIOR', 'PROBABILITIES', 'INFORMATION']",['judgments'],discounts
"Drawing on the stereotype content model (SCM), we investigate the impact of both explicit and implicit country stereotypes on consumer preferences. In Study 1, we show that the competence dimension of the SCM (measured both explicitly and implicitly) drives purchase intention by positively influencing brand affect. In Study 2, we disentangle further the role of explicit and implicit stereotypes and show that explicit judgments of country competence are better predictors of deliberate consumer choices, whereas implicit judgments of country warmth dominate spontaneous choice. Managerially our findings indicate that sole reliance on explicit stereotypes may result in an incomplete picture of consumers' responses to country-of-origin cues.","['country of origin', 'Stereotype content model', 'implicit stereotypes', 'spontaneous and deliberate choice', 'IATASSOCIATION TEST', 'OF-ORIGIN', 'SOCIAL COGNITION', 'THEORY PERSPECTIVE', 'ATTITUDE MEASURES', 'BIAS MAP', 'COMPETENCE', 'BRAND', 'VALIDITY', 'BEHAVIOR']","['country of origin', 'country of origin', 'country of origin', 'stereotype content model', 'stereotype content model', 'stereotype content model', 'implicit stereotypes', 'implicit stereotypes', 'of origin', 'of origin', 'competence', 'brand']",stereotype content model country stereotypes origin cues
"Managers within firms have to make choices along a large number of dimensions; for instance, how to configure activities involving manufacturing and marketing, and which organizational design to employ. Since these choices interact with each other, firms can be conceived of as systems of interdependent choices. In this article, I discuss research that addresses three questions that naturally arise in this context. First, how do such systems evolve over time? Second, what role does organizational design play in whether a firm will arrive at a consistent and high-performing set of choices? Third, what are the consequences of cognitive limitations by decision makers when faced with such complex systems? The article concludes by sketching out possible future directions of research in this domain.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS', 'STRATEGY', 'SEARCH', 'EXPLORATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EVOLUTION', 'ADAPTATION', 'MODEL']",['search'],design systems limitations
"This research marks the first attempt to investigate the cause marketing-customer profitability relationship, and to assess whether features can moderate the influence of cause marketing (CM) on customer profitability for a focal brand and its main rival. We obtain a panel dataset on 7257 customers to evaluate the Yoplait-Susan G. Komen partnership. On a propensity score matched sample, we estimate a multilevel model and find that Yoplait's CM initiative positively influences Yoplait's customer profitability (2.70%), along with a deleterious effect on Dannon's customer profitability (-13.31%). These findings are theoretically meaningful and pragmatically useful as they: (1) provide behavioral evidence of CM's profit impact, (2) establish CM as an offensive strategy that cultivates the rival's customers, (3) suggest features can amplify the effect of CM on the focal brand's customer profitability, and (4) support that managers can add CM to their strategic marketing arsenal as an instrument to strengthen brand equity.","['Brand equity', 'cause marketing', 'marketing strategy', 'multilevel modeling', 'propensity score matchingCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'CONSUMER PRODUCT RESPONSES', 'PROPENSITY-SCORE', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'CHOICE', 'PROMOTION', 'MODEL', 'ASSOCIATIONS', 'SALES', 'PHILANTHROPY']","['brand equity', 'brand equity', 'cause marketing', 'cause marketing', 'propensity score', 'propensity score', 'model']",cause marketing marketing brand equity
"Research Summary Digital platforms offer a promising contemporary means for encouraging social innovation through cross-sector collaboration. Yet although such social-mission platforms are equipped to facilitate a high number of arms-length transactions, they are conversely ill-equipped to provide the necessary consensus which typically characterizes successful examples of cross-sector collaboration. Employing an in-depth archival case study of a civic crowdfunding platform, we surface a process model of social-mission platform creation, which exposes the dilemmas such platforms encounter as they attempt to navigate user growth, and the importance of institutional infrastructure for overcoming these dilemmas. These findings and our emergent model thus contribute new theory regarding the creation of digital platforms for enabling cross-sector collaboration and social innovation, while bridging the emerging body of research on platforms with institutional theory. Managerial Summary Developing a digital platform for social good requires operators to maintain control over their mission as they grow, while working with actors from across sectors. While the economics of the platform may be clear, the social infrastructure to ensure effective and mission-aligned interaction between different segments of the platform needs to be developed. In our case study of a civic crowdfunding platform, we demonstrate how this platform strategically generates and promotes understandings of its boundaries, creates bridges between diverse stakeholders necessary for participation, and provides blueprints to shape and standardize platform interactions. We also discuss the potential susceptibility of social-mission platforms to experience mission drift as they grow, the existential threat that such drift poses in this context, and the ways that organizations might overcome this threat.","['civic crowdfunding', 'cross-sector collaboration', 'digital platforms', 'institutional infrastructure', 'social innovation', 'social-mission platformsSOCIAL-STRUCTURE', 'PUBLIC-POLICY', 'GIG ECONOMY', 'INNOVATION', 'FIELD', 'CHALLENGES', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'STANDARDS', 'WORK', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP']","['civic crowdfunding', 'civic crowdfunding', 'cross sector collaboration', 'cross sector collaboration', 'cross sector collaboration', 'digital platforms', 'digital platforms', 'institutional infrastructure', 'institutional infrastructure', 'social innovation', 'social innovation', 'innovation', 'organizations', 'work']",platforms cross sector collaboration crowdfunding institutional infrastructure
"This paper examines the emergence of temporal coordination among multiple interdependent routines in a complex work setting that does not allow for up-front scheduling. We propose that when actors continuously have to prioritize their expected contributions to multiple interdependent routines, they address this challenge by orienting not just toward routines but also toward person-roles. Drawing on an ethnographic study of an agile consulting project team confronted with continued scheduling failures, we demonstrate how the dynamics of prioritizing enabled the actors to resolve what at first appeared to be an irresolvable and highly complex problem of temporal coordination. We add to the literature on routine dynamics and temporality by setting forth the dynamics of prioritizing as an explanation for the temporal patterning of complex work settings. We introduce the notion of role-routine ecologies as a novel way to conceptualize such complex work settings and contribute to developing a performative theory of person-roles and their significance for coordinating.","['work', 'role', 'routine', 'interdependence', 'conflict', 'cooperation', 'ecologyORGANIZATIONAL ROUTINES', 'ROLE-SET', 'COORDINATION', 'WORK', 'TIME', 'DETERMINANTS', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'CONFLICT', 'PROJECTS', 'BEHAVIOR']","['work', 'role', 'routine', 'coordination', 'work']",
"In this study, we explore how failure in the form of the first lost game of the college football season for a team influences specific content within the narratives constructed regarding that loss and how those narratives are associated with subsequent performance. Building on theoretical perspectives regarding sports management, entrepreneurial orientation (EO), emotions, and the use of narratives for sensemaking, we develop and test an EO-related sports management model of failure narratives. Using computer-aided text analysis of transcripts from head coaches' press conferences directly following their team's first loss of the season as well as regression analysis, we found that the narrative's EO content has a U-shaped relationship with subsequent (i.e., next game) performance. Additionally, negative emotional content had a similar U-shaped relationship with subsequent performance. Finally, positive emotional content exhibited an inverse U-shaped relationship with subsequent performance. We discuss the implications of these results on the literatures regarding EO, emotions, and sports management as well as possible avenues for future research.","['nanPOSITIVE EMOTIONS', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'SENSEMAKING', 'RUMINATION', 'INNOVATION', 'FOLLOWERS', 'STRATEGY']",['sensemaking'],sports management entrepreneurial orientation emotions
"Similar in-house (or insourced) and offshored software development data were paired to find differences (if any) on four project performance criteria: project elapsed times, size, data quality, and same-source nations. For each paired project, the differences between five technical variables (development type, application-type, architecture, development platform, and programming language) were considered. The resource dependency theory was used to examine the technical differences between matched projects. Additionally, Hofstede's cultural dimensions were used to analyze the performance of offshored software projects. Data from the International Software Benchmarking Standard Group (ISBSG) was used. The main empirical findings were as follows: project completion time is significantly shorter for in-house development projects; and firms prefer offshoring for new projects, client-service platforms, and newer application languages.

"A sizeable body of international business (IB) research is devoted to building knowledge about the determinants of organizational performance. A key precursor to accurately diagnosing why some organizations succeed in the international marketplace while others struggle is operationalizing performance appropriately.

"Research summary: Although most theories of growth presume that growth varies with the focus and limits of managerial attention, the actual role played by attention has remained largely implicit. In contrast, this article explicitly considers attention structure and the processes that place sustained focus on growth issues. We explain how attention structure-specialized attention within a particular unit and integrated attention between units-affects both bottom-up (stimulus-driven) and top-down (schema-driven) attentional processing of new issues. We also examine the relationship between attention structure and divisional interdependencies, identifying conditions under which different attentional patterns generate organizational tensions that lead to architectural elaboration: the delineation of new organizational units. This logic is illustrated with examples from Motorola, a large telecommunications equipment provider, during a period of sustained growth. In linking theories of growth with the attention-based view (ABV), we augment both perspectives and offer an approach that provides a better understand growth's cognitive underpinnings. Managerial summary: We examine how, within a multi-divisional firm, the pattern of organizational attention affects firm growth. We highlight the attention focus within and between divisions and the corporate office and specific processes that shape the intensity and direction of attention in the firm's constituent units. In particular, we examine how corporate interventions, appointment of managerial resources, prototyping, and corporate charters direct managerial attention and the identification and advancement new opportunities in support of growth. Our approach also considers how attention patterns and formal organizational structure interact to cause tensions between managers, and when these tensions lead to the delineation of new subunits. To illustrate our logic, we use examples drawn from Motorola, a large telecommunications equipment provider, during a period of sustained growth. Our approach offers managers insights into attentional design of the multi-divisional firm.","['attention', 'growth', 'organizational conflict', 'organizational design', 'structureRESOURCE-BASED VIEW', 'KNOWLEDGE-BASED THEORY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'STRATEGIC ISSUES', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'EVOLUTION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'COGNITION', 'PRODUCT', 'MARKET']","['attention', 'growth']",research growth attention issues firm

Together with those papers selected to be included in this special issue, the authors set out both to explore and contribute to a number of the current academic debates in relation to DL, while at the same time examining the extent to which research on DL has permeated the management field. The paper examines a number of key concepts, ideas and themes in relation to DL and, in so doing, highlights the insights offered through new contributions and interpretations. The paper offers a means by which forms of DL might be conceptualized to be better incorporated into researchers' scholarship and research, and a framework is presented which considers a number of different dimensions of DL, how it may be planned, and how it may emerge, together with how it may or may not align with other organizational activities and aspects.","['nanSHARED LEADERSHIP', 'INNOVATION', 'MANAGEMENT', 'NETWORKS']",['management'],distributed leadership management field
"Marketers, educators, and caregivers often refer to instrumental benefits to convince preschoolers to eat (e. g., This food will make you strong). We propose that preschoolers infer that if food is instrumental to achieve a goal, it is less tasty, and therefore they consume less of it. Accordingly, we find that preschoolers (3-5.5 years old) rated crackers as less tasty and consumed fewer of them when the crackers were presented as instrumental to achieving a health goal (studies 1-2). In addition, preschoolers consumed fewer carrots and crackers when these were presented as instrumental to knowing how to read (study 3) and to count (studies 4-5). This research supports an inference account for the negative impact of certain persuasive messages on consumption: preschoolers who are exposed to one association (e. g., between eating carrots and intellectual performance) infer another association (e. g., between carrots and taste) must be weaker.","['nanCHILDRENS TASTE', 'OBESITY', 'CHILDHOOD', 'ADOLESCENTS', 'PREFERENCES', 'CONTINGENCY', 'CONSUMPTION', 'PREVALENCE', 'OVERWEIGHT', 'INFERENCES']",['consumption'],marketers

"Purpose - This paper aims to identify reverse flows and exchanges that support public service provision. Reverse flow literature has focused on manufacturing based supply chains using the lens of exchange (recovery, reuse, repair and recycle) to gain performance improvement in product flows. Limited research is available to support an understanding of customer-derived reverse exchange (RE) service processes. The authors contribute to the service literature through the development of RE antecedents and derive new and revised definitions with the supporting constructs of RE service processes. Design/methodology/approach - This paper synthesises literature creating a framework of antecedents for RE. Antecedents reflect differences of service flow (level of service inseparability and 'acting upon'). These antecedents are empirically tested within an illustrative pre-existing UK healthcare case study against the synthesised antecedents and existing RE definitions. Two teams of researchers reviewed the data generated from public service supply chain processes. Definitions of RE were either revised or derived from the empirical data by each team. Findings - The service concept of 'acting upon' for inseparable public service supply chain flows provides a basis for examining the existence of reverse flows and exchanges. Revised and new classifications to the RE model are proposed to stimulate contextual performance improvement and innovation in public service provision. Psychological utility is an additional feature to economic, environmental and social utility in public service RE. RE offers practitioners and academics a strategic operational competence to achieve improvement and innovation in public services and further advance this concept. Originality/value - Extending the literature beyond the manufacturing derived RE concept to develop an understanding of the customer's role in preserving and co-creating value in RE and flows in public service. New RE antecedents for public services, including the potential of psychological utility, are presented.","['Co-creation', 'Closed loop supply chains', 'Public sector', 'Customer value', 'Learning organizations', 'Healthcare serviceSUPPLY CHAINS', 'INSTITUTIONAL ISOMORPHISM', 'INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY', 'HEALTH-CARE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LOGISTICS', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'FRAMEWORK', 'CHALLENGES', 'MANAGEMENT']","['performance', 'framework']",reverse flows service exchange performance antecedents inseparability model

'Private benefits' and 'common benefits' differ in the incentives that they create for investment in learning. The competitive aspects of alliances are most severe when a firm's ratio of private to common benefits is high. We introduce a measure, 'relative scope' of a firm in an alliance, to show that the opportunity set of each firm outside an alliance crucially impacts its behavior within the alliance. Finally, we suggest why firms might deviate from the theoretically optimal behavior patterns.

We develop and test theory about the nature of bonding in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of 42 subjects (21 entrepreneurs and 21 parents). We find that entrepreneurs and parents show similar signs of affective bonding, that self-confidence plays a role in bonding style, and that the degree to which entrepreneurs include their ventures in the self and to which parents include their child in the self influences their ability to make critical assessments. Our findings suggest that bonding is similar for entrepreneurs and parents and that venture stimuli influence reward systems, self-regulatory functions, and mental factors that are associated with judgment.","['Bonding', 'fMRI', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Parenting', 'Self-confidence', 'Bonding style', 'Judgment', 'NeuropsychologyRIGHT TEMPOROPARIETAL JUNCTION', 'TEMPORO-PARIETAL JUNCTION', 'ATTACHMENT THEORY', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP', 'SELF-EFFICACY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY', 'CONSUMER PARTICIPATION', 'CAREGIVING SYSTEM', 'BRAIN']","['bonding', 'fmri', 'self confidence', 'self confidence', 'bonding style', 'bonding style', 'judgment']",fmri self confidence
"A firm's strategic innovation orientation, which is aimed at discovering and satisfying emerging customer needs with novel technological solutions, has repeatedly been shown to be crucial for firm innovativeness and firm performance. Despite its apparent importance, relatively little research has addressed antecedents of a firm's strategic orientation that help explain heterogeneity in innovation strategies across firms. Especially the influence of top management teams (TMT) should be critical, since innovation strategies are shaped at the top management level. Building on the theory of upper echelon, this study investigates how TMT characteristics affect a firm's strategic innovation orientation, and how this relates to innovation outcomes and firm performance. Hypotheses are tested on a sample of goods manufacturers using a combination of survey data, document analysis, and objective capital market data for firm performance. Results indicate that TMT diversity, measured as heterogeneity in educational, functional, industry, and organizational background, has a strong positive effect on a firm's innovation orientation. A strong proactive focus on emerging customer needs and on novel technologies then lead to a portfolio of new products with higher market newness and technology newness, which both increase firm performance. The results therefore emphasize the importance of TMT characteristics as antecedent for innovation strategy and innovation outcomes.","['nanMARKET ORIENTATION', 'PRODUCT INNOVATIVENESS', 'RADICAL INNOVATION', 'GENDER DIVERSITY', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'FIRM', 'IMPACT', 'HETEROGENEITY', 'DIVERSIFICATION', 'BENCHMARKING']","['firm', 'heterogeneity']",performance top management teams diversity

"This paper reviews research on open innovation that considers how and why firms commercialize external sources of innovations. It examines both the outside-in and coupled modes of open innovation. From an analysis of prior research on how firms leverage external sources of innovation, it suggests a four-phase model in which a linear process(1) obtaining, (2) integrating, and (3) commercializing external innovationsis combined with (4) interaction between the firm and its collaborators. This model is used to classify papers taken from the top 25 innovation journals, complemented by highly cited work beyond those journals. A review of 291 open innovation-related publications from these sources shows that the majority of these articles indeed address elements of this inbound open innovation process model. Specifically, it finds that researchers have front-loaded their examination of the leveraging process, with an emphasis on obtaining innovations from external sources. However, there is a relative dearth of research related to integrating and commercializing these innovations. Research on obtaining innovations includes searching, enabling, filtering, and acquiringeach category with its own specific set of mechanisms and conditions. Integrating innovations has been mostly studied from an absorptive capacity perspective, with less attention given to the impact of competencies and culture (including not invented here). Commercializing innovations puts the most emphasis on how external innovations create value rather than how firms capture value from those innovations. Finally, the interaction phase considers both feedback for the linear process and reciprocal innovation processes such as cocreation, network collaboration, and community innovation. This review and synthesis suggests several gaps in prior research. One is a tendency to ignore the importance of business models, despite their central role in distinguishing open innovation from earlier research on interorganizational collaboration in innovation. Another gap is a tendency in open innovation to use innovation in a way inconsistent with earlier definitions in innovation management. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research that include examining the end-to-end innovation commercialization process, and studying the moderators and limits of leveraging external sources of innovation.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION', 'CLOSED INNOVATION', 'DISCONTINUOUS INNOVATION', 'FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'COMPLEMENTARY ASSETS']","['absorptive capacity', 'absorptive capacity']",process

"This paper reviews the literature in a number of areas that converge upon the theme of the role of knowledge within professional identity. Within knowledge transfer literature the individual perspective is underdeveloped, and this paper seeks to contribute by exploring the function of knowledge within an individual's professional identity, thus unfolding a theoretical connection between the literatures of knowledge and identity. Its central argument concurs with Szulanski's notion of 'internal stickiness' as a barrier to knowledge transfer but extends this hypothesis into the psychological ownership of knowledge and to the idea of 'possessiveness'. The paper argues that the value of self-categorized knowledge places the latter within the individual's cognitive structure of their identity. It offers up the idea of valued knowledge to the knowledge transfer domain and suggests that feelings of possessiveness towards knowledge may intervene in the willingness of an individual to disclose knowledge in a knowledge transfer process.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS', 'PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY', 'INDUSTRIAL-INNOVATION', 'ACADEMIC RESEARCH', 'TACIT KNOWLEDGE', 'MERE OWNERSHIP', 'SELF-CONCEPT', 'WORK', 'WILLINGNESS']","['professional identity', 'professional identity', 'willingness']",transfer psychological possessiveness

"Purpose - There has been limited research examining the influence of inter-organisational relationships and the social capital they may nurture in building SCRES. The authors aim to explore how three dimensions of sbcial capital (cognitive, structural and relational) may act as facilitators or enablers. of the four formative capabilities for SCRES (i.e. flexibility, velocity, visibility, and collaboration), identified by Juttner and Maklan. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from three separate tiers of the supply chain involved in the response to an extreme event (the Lambrigg, UK rail crash). Using a social constructionist approach, the paper explores how social capital may enable the emergence of formative capabilities for resilience. Findings - The data suggest that the dimensions of social capital may play an influential role in facilitating the four formative capabilities for SCRES and indicate the potential for these to be mutually reinforcing. Research limitations/implications - The paper provides an illustration of some links between resilience and social capital constructs within one supply network, in the context of crisis response. Different types of network and contexts may result in other outcomes and have other facilitating effects upon SCRES. These findings should be explored within other contexts. Practical implications - The authors highlight that social capital may be nurtured deliberately or emerge as a consequence of relationships within a network. Formal efforts to build network communications, norms of reciprocity may create the conditions for appropriable organisations to emerge when faced with extreme events. Originality/value - Drawing from a social capital perspective, this paper contributes to a fuller understanding of notions of relational capital.","['Risk management', 'Supplier relationships', 'Supply and demand', 'Social factors', 'Supply chain managementDYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'NETWORK', 'FLEXIBILITY', 'EXPLORATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'CRISIS', 'VIEW']","['network', 'flexibility', 'perspective', 'crisis']",social capital capabilities
"The study of interorganizational imitation has been an important strand in the recent literature on institutional theory. This paper offers new insights for our understanding of mimetic isomorphism and its reliance on legitimacy: we suggest that legitimacy-based reference groups guide firms in their mimetic behaviour, that firms undertake imitation even against their own ex ante information, and that legitimacy-based imitation contributes negatively to firms' profitability. We examine Portuguese bank branching decisions between 1988 and 1996 and find that banks imitate their legitimacy-based groups, and not only towards ex ante (firm-specific) attractive locations, but also towards unattractive locations; we also find that mimetic branching produces a negative effect on profitability. We conclude that these results show the importance of legitimacy pressures on organization decisions and the tension between the pressure to conform and the pressure to perform.","['nanINTERORGANIZATIONAL IMITATION', 'STRATEGIC CHOICE', 'HERD BEHAVIOR', 'ISOMORPHISM', 'ADOPTION', 'IMPACT', 'MARKET', 'MODEL', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'PROFITABILITY']","['isomorphism', 'profitability']",institutional theory legitimacy pressures
"A developing stream of research in the strategy, field explores the competitive structure of industries,from the perspective of industry participants. This work, has demonstrated that managers develop strategic group knowledge structures in order to make sense of their competitive environment. This study extends this line of research by examining the complexity evident in the strategic group knowledge structures dei,eloped by firms' top management teams and assessing the relationship between complexity in these knowledge structures and subsequent firm performance. Specifically, we examine the complexity of top managers' knowledge structures regarding their competition using a sample of 76 top management teams from banks in three U.S. cities. Using hierarchical regression, we find a significant relationship between the complexity of cognitive strategic groups and subsequent firm performance.

"Foreign firms from emergent economies are increasingly seeking equity capital in developed economies like the United States. Utilizing institutional, signaling, and agency theories this research examines the legitimacy of foreign IPOs (initial public offerings) in the United States. Employing the population of foreign IPOs listed on U.S. stock exchanges between 1997 and 2004, it is demonstrated that firms from countries with governmental policies and institutional practices that protect the economic freedom of its citizens are significantly less underpriced than IPOs of firms originating from countries experiencing lower levels of economic freedom. The evidence further indicates that firms from emerging economies can overcome negative country perceptions associated with lower levels of legitimacy by increasing their international scope of operations prior to beginning the IPO process as well as by retaining acceptable levels of ownership in their respective firms.","['nanGLOBAL DIVERSIFICATION', 'SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION', 'MARKET-SEGMENTATION', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'FORMAL-STRUCTURE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FIRM', 'ORGANIZATIONS', 'INDUSTRY', 'MANAGEMENT']","['emerging economies', 'emerging economies', 'firm']",united
"This article presents a conceptual framework for the analysis of vegetable supply chains in a South East Asian context and the role wholesale markets play in these chains. Following a review of the literature on food marketing systems in developing countries and preliminary fieldwork in South East Asia, a holistic framework is proposed, including what are perceived to be the critical factors in the development of improved fresh food marketing systems: domestic legal and policy factors, international trade policies and food markets, history, geography, and cultural and social norms. The particular role of trust and collaboration among stakeholders in the Ho Chi Minh City vegetable marketing system is highlighted.","['food industry', 'marketing systems', 'buyer-seller relationships', 'supply chain management', 'Vietnam', 'wholesalingCHINESE', 'TRUST', 'BUSINESS', 'STAGE']","['marketing systems', 'marketing systems', 'trust']",developing countries
"For an industry facing both internationalization and impending maturity, available strategic prescriptions suggest four options which are at variance with each other. To assess the validity of competing strategic prescriptions, the outcomes of these four options are examined empirically by means of a longitudinal study of the vehicle components industry. Rather than going for strategies based on market domination, large British vehicle component companies would generally have performed better had they concentrated on resource-based priorities; market domination has generally only proved feasible in national markets, and the outcomes of such strategies have proved little short of disastrous. Explanations are explored through a case study of one British national market leader and through international comparisons from Germany, the U.S.A. and Japan, which highlight the importance of manufacturing policies as primary sources of sustainable competitive advantage.","['GLOBAL, NATIONAL', 'STRATEGY', 'VEHICLE', 'COMPONENTCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'MARKET-SHARE']",['vehicle'],industry

At the team level, average educational attainment and horizontal tie strength were significant predictors of student improvement. We provide some evidence that team horizontal tie strength and density moderate the relationship between teacher ability and student performance.

"This study of small businesses created between 1989 and 1992, and then closed down between 1993 and 1996, reveals that owners often described their firms as successful when the closure decision was made. Decisions to discontinue operations of young firms are shaped by intertwined factors including opportunity costs, switching costs, and noneconomic considerations. Empirical investigation is undertaken to explain the seeming paradox of successful small-business closure. Alternative opportunities are identified as a key reason for choosing to discontinue successful firms: If something more attractive comes along, the owner may close down. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We then propose that both organizational procedural memory (skill knowledge) and declarative memory (fact knowledge) moderate improvisation's impact on organizational outcomes in distinct ways. We also suggest that improvisation influences organizational memory by (1) generating experiments and (2) permitting the development of higher-level competency in improvisation, Contemporary technological changes related to the nature of organizational memory intensify the salience of these issues.","['nanPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT', 'STRATEGY FORMATION', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'INFORMATION', 'INNOVATION', 'TEACHERS', 'NOVICE', 'CREATIVITY', 'EXPERT', 'IMPACT']",['impact'],time knowledge
"Building on social embeddedness theory, we examine how the competencies and resources of one corporate actor in a network are transferred to another actor that uses them to enhance transactions with a third actor-a strategic process we dub 'network transitivity.' Focusing on the properties of network transitivity in the context of small-firm corporate finance, we consider how embedded relations between a firm and its banks facilitate the firm's access to distinctive capabilities that enable it to strategically manage its trade-credit financing relationships. We apply theory and original case-study fieldwork to explore the types of resources and competencies available through bank-firm relationships and to derive hypotheses about how embedded bank-firm relationships affect the strategy of small to medium-sized firms. Using a separate large-scale data set, we then test the generalizability of our hypotheses. Our qualitative analyses show that embedded bank-firm ties provide special governance arrangements that facilitate the firm's access to bank-centered informational and capital resources, which uniquely enhance the firm's ability to manage trade credit. Consistent with our arguments, our statistical analyses show that small- to medium-sized firms with embedded ties to their bankers were more likely, to take lucrative early-payment trade discounts and avoid costly late-payment penalties than were similar firms that lacked embedded ties - suggesting that social embeddedness beneficially affects the financial performance of the firm.

"This research documents a phenomenon we call the endowed progress effect, whereby people provided with artificial advancement toward a goal exhibit greater persistence toward reaching the goal. By converting a task requiring eight steps into a task requiring 10 steps but with two steps already complete, the task is reframed as one that has been undertaken and incomplete rather than not yet begun. This increases the likelihood of task completion and decreases completion time. The effect appears to depend on perceptions of task completion rather than a desire to avoid wasting the endowed progress.

"Recent developments in the global economy and in multinational corporations have placed significant emphasis on the cognitive orientations of managers, giving rise to a number of concepts such as 'global mindset' that are presumed to be associated with the effective management of multinational corporations. This paper reviews the literature on global mindset and clarifies some of the conceptual confusion surrounding the construct. We identify common themes across writers, suggesting that the majority of studies fall into one of three research perspectives: cultural, strategic, and multidimensional. We also identify two constructs from the social sciences - cosmopolitanism and cognitive complexity - that underlie the perspectives found in the literature. We then use these two constructs to develop an integrative theoretical framework of global mindset. We then provide a critical assessment of the field of global mindset and suggest directions for future theoretical and empirical research.","['global mindset', 'managerial cognition', 'competitivenessLATENT SOCIAL ROLES', 'DECISION-MAKING', 'ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE', 'CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT', 'LOCAL-COSMOPOLITAN', 'INFORMATION SEARCH', 'ENTERPRISE', 'BEHAVIOR']","['global mindset', 'global mindset']",mindset management cosmopolitanism cognitive complexity
"The global coffee sector has seen a transformation towards more sustainable' forms of production, and, simultaneously, the continued dominance of mainstream coffee firms and practices. We examine this paradox by conceptualizing the underlying process of political corporate social responsibility (PCSR) as a series of long-term, multi-dimensional interactions between civil society and corporate actors, drawing from the neo-Gramscian concepts of hegemony and passive revolution. A longitudinal study of the evolution of coffee sustainability standards suggests that PCSR can be understood as a process of challenging and defending value regimes, within which viable configurations of economic models, normative-cultural values, and governance structures are aligned and stabilized. Specifically, we show how dynamics of moves and accommodations between challengers and corporate actors shape the practice and meaning of 'sustainable' coffee. The results contribute to understanding the political dynamics of CSR as a dialectic process of 'revolution/restoration', or passive revolution, whereby value regimes assimilate and adapt to potentially disruptive challenges, transforming sustainability practices and discourse.","['coffee', 'Gramsci', 'passive revolution', 'political corporate social responsibility', 'sustainability', 'sustainability standards', 'value regimesCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'PATH DEPENDENCE', 'FAIR TRADE', 'GOVERNANCE', 'BUSINESS', 'FIRM', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'STANDARDS', 'ECONOMY', 'LABOR']","['coffee', 'gramsci', 'passive revolution', 'passive revolution', 'political corporate social responsibility', 'political corporate social responsibility', 'political corporate social responsibility', 'political corporate social responsibility', 'sustainability', 'sustainability standards', 'sustainability standards', 'governance', 'firm', 'standards']",corporate social responsibility hegemony sustainability
"This study examines whether, how and why an entrepreneur's gender influences firm innovativeness. Drawing upon research on gender-segregated educational and employment experiences, we suggest that firms led by women will exhibit less innovation breadth and depth than those led by men due to differences in the degree to which male versus female entrepreneurs resemble jacks-(or jills)-of-all trades'. Analysis of survey data collected from 900 business owner-managers in Germany lends overall support albeit with some noteworthy exceptions. Our findings point to the need for an even more nuanced approach to research at the nexus of gender, entrepreneurship, and innovation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

"Because of suggested beneficial effects of word-of-mouth (AXIOM) referral, service companies have invested large amounts of money in customer referral programs as well as programs aimed at fostering positive communication among their existing customers. The question of cross-cultural differences in the effectiveness of WOM has recently gained increased prominence. The authors contribute to research on this topic by proposing a positive effect of received WO M on service quality perceptions among existing customers. Moreover, they predict that cultural values moderate this effect. They test the model on 1910 bank customers in 11 countries. The results show that received WOM has a positive effect on customer service quality perceptions. Furthermore, received WOM has a stronger effect on the evaluation of customers in high-uncertainty-avoidance than in low-uncertainty-avoidance cultures. No other cultural value is a significant moderator. The results imply that received WOM is also important to existing customers and that managers should adjust their strategy of referral marketing to match their target group's uncertainty-avoidance level.","['culture', 'word of mouth', 'service', 'service quality', 'consumer behaviorNATIONAL CULTURE', 'E-COMMERCE', 'SOCIAL-INFLUENCE', 'INFORMATION', 'BEHAVIOR', 'VALUES', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'RECOVERY', 'CLIMATE', 'QUALITY']","['culture', 'word of mouth', 'word of mouth', 'word of mouth', 'service', 'service quality', 'service quality', 'values', 'quality']",model uncertainty avoidance
"This paper examines learning in interdisciplinary action teams. Research on team effectiveness has focused primarily on single-discipline teams engaged in routine production tasks and, less often, on interdisciplinary teams engaged in discussion and management rather than action. The resulting models do not explain differences in learning in interdisciplinary action teams. Members of these teams must coordinate action in uncertain, fast-paced situations, and the extent to which they are comfortable speaking up with observations, questions, and concerns may critically influence team outcomes. To explore what leaders of action teams do to promote speaking up and other proactive coordination behaviours - as well as how organizational context may affect these team processes and outcomes - I analysed qualitative and quantitative data from 16 operating room teams learning to use a new technology for cardiac surgery. Team leader coaching, ease of speaking up, and boundary spanning were associated with successful technology implementation. The most effective leaders helped teams learn by communicating a motivating rationale for change and by minimizing concerns about power and status differences to promote speaking up in the service of learning.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'WORK TEAMS', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS', 'INNOVATION', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'HOSPITALS', 'ROUTINES', 'TASK']","['management', 'task']",models speaking coordination

Next, we examine the tax deductions granted to the self-employed through amendments made to the 1986 Tax Reform Act. Using the Current Population Surveys for 1996-2007, we find that while the increasingly generous tax deductions left entry decisions largely unaffected, they had limited effects on exits. Thus, the health care system in the U.S. may have implications for entrepreneurial activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"Product design has been recognized as an opportunity for differential advantage in the market place. The appearance of a product influences consumer product choice in several ways. To help product development managers in optimizing the appearance of products, the present study identified the different ways in which the appearance of a product plays a role in consumer product evaluation and. hence. choice. In addition, the implications for product design of each role are listed. and managerial recommendations for optimizing, the appearance of products are given. Based on a literature review, six different roles of product appearance for consumers are identified: (1) communication of aesthetic, (2) symbolic, (3) functional, and (4) ergonomic information; (5) attention drawing; and (6) categorization. A product's appearance can have aesthetic and symbolic value for consumers, can communicate functional characteristics and give a quality impression (functional value), and can communicate ease of use (ergonomic value). In addition, it can draw attention and can influence the ease of categorization of the product. In a large qualitative study (N = 142) it was tested whether these roles indeed exist in consumers' process of product choice and whether they are sufficient to describe the way in which product appearance plays a role for consumers. In addition, qualitative insight into these roles was gained. After making a choice between two answering machines, subjects were interviewed about the reasons for their choice and the product information they used to form the judgments underlying their choice reasons. The six appearance roles indeed proved relevant for consumers and were sufficient to describe the influence of product appearance on product choice. The number of ways in which appearance played a role for consumers differed between 0 and 5: most subjects mentioned two different ways in which appearance influenced their product choice. The aesthetic and symbolic roles were mentioned most often. The preferred shape (e.g., rounded or angular), color, or size were found to differ depending on the way in which product appearance played a role for subjects. For example, bright colors may be valued from an aesthetic point of view but may diminish the impression of quality (i.e., functional value). This makes it difficult to optimize all roles and illustrates that the product value that is most important for consumers when purchasing a specific kind of product should be the starting point in the design of the product appearance. Furthermore, the influence of shape, color, or size on a certain kind of product value-aesthetic. symbolic, ergonomic, or functional-differed between subjects. One person may like a rounded shape, while another may prefer a rectangular shape. This means that the value of guidelines indicating how the perception of a specific kind of product value can be engendered by means of shape, color, and size is limited. This is especially the case for aesthetic and symbolic product value, which are very personal. Therefore it is recommended to test the performance of the appearance of a newly developed product on these six roles with the target group of consumers. Insight into the different ways in which appearance characteristics, such as form and color, may influence consumer choice will increase managers' awareness about how to use product appearance as a marketing tool. In addition, distinguishing these six appearance roles will help product development managers to optimize the product appearance better to market needs, as the roles have different and sometimes even conflicting implications for the design of the product appearance.","['nanINDUSTRIAL-DESIGN', 'SELF-CONCEPT', 'PURCHASE', 'CATEGORIZATION', 'PROTOTYPICALITY', 'CONSUMPTION', 'TYPICALITY', 'BEHAVIOR', 'BRAND']",['categorization'],

"A growing body of literature indicates that the new product development (NPD) process in technology-based, industrial markets is characterized by collaborative seller-buyer relationships. Unfortunately, the extant literature is deficient in some significant ways. For example, there is no theoretical framework that explicates the content of these relationships. Also, there is little empirical research on the antecedents or consequences of these relationships. Therefore, managers seeking guidance on how to manage their NPD relationships have lacked appropriate insights. Not surprisingly, ineffective relationship management is a major contributor to new product failure in such settings. Against this background, this study develops and tests a model of seller-buyer interactions during NPD. The model is based on the relationship marketing literature and is rooted in Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA). It was tested using data from 296 small to mid-sized firms in a variety of technology-based, industrial markets. It specifies product co-development, education, and post-installation product knowledge generation as three key behavioral dimensions that characterize seller-buyer interactions during NPD. Our results indicate that the intensity with which these dimensions are undertaken vary with buyer-related (i.e., perceived buyer knowledge and prior relationship history) and innovation-related (i.e., product customization and innovation discontinuity) characteristics. For example, perceived buyer knowledge has a positive impact on product co-development while innovation discontinuity has a positive impact on education. Further, we find that a seller's satisfaction with undertaking these behaviors is moderated by the technological uncertainty in the seller's industry. As a case in point, satisfaction with undertaking product co-development is reduced when technological uncertainty is high. Collectively, the overall support we find for our model can help NPD managers optimize their relationships with buyers during NPD.","['nanTRANSACTION COST-ANALYSIS', 'CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION', 'MEASUREMENT ERROR', 'FUTURE', 'IMPLEMENTATION', 'ORGANIZATION', 'OPPORTUNISM', 'GOVERNANCE', 'MODEL', 'TRUST']",['model'],transaction analysis
"The study of institutional change is a core research area in organization theory and is of increasing relevance for scholarship in other disciplines. In this article, we review the substantial number of studies that have examined the ways by which institutions are created, modified, or transformed, highlighting the lack of integration of prior works that emphasize exogenous shocks, institutional entrepreneurship, and practice-based change. Drawing on the institutional logics perspective, we then develop a novel typology of pathways of change that more comprehensively brings together this diverse literature, accounts for the richness and heterogeneity of institutional change processes unveiled by studies to date, and provides a more synthetic framework to guide future research.

"With the advances of information technology, online social networks are becoming increasingly important venues for technology adoption. However, although the dynamics of technology adoption in real world social networks have been well documented, technology adoption in online social networks remains relatively under-explored. This study identifies the differences between online and offline social networks and proposes a framework to investigate the dynamics of technology adoption in online social networks. To illustrate the proposed research framework, this study employs behavior-link panel data obtained from an open source software (OSS) development network to examine how online social networks affect the adoption of Subversion, the latest OSS version control technology. Based on social network theory, co-membership is used to construct online social networks within the OSS development network. Methodologically, this study takes advantage of the panel dataset and addresses the issues of simultaneity and individual heterogeneity that frequently confound the relationship between network structure and adoption decision, and as a result it demonstrates a more compelling relationship between social networks and technology adoption. The results of this study reveal that social networks are major conduits for technology adoption in an online social network in terms of imitation, leadership, lock-in, similarity, recency, and team size effects. In online social networks, one's decision to adopt a new technology is strongly influenced by the actions of the connected others. Project leaders have a stronger influence over other members in technology adoption decision making, even in informal virtual teams where traditional governance structures do not apply. Older projects exhibit stronger inertia and thus lack innovativeness. Similarities among projects facilitate faster adoption, and the effect of leadership attenuates in the networks with increasing project dissimilarity. Recent adoptions of technology within the networks, rather than more distant ones, have a stronger impact on subsequent adoption, implying the salience of memory over usage confidence, and increased size of a project team accelerates the rate of adoption. These results help in understanding the dynamics of technology adoption in online social networks, and provide useful guidelines for firms to promote technology and product innovation.","['nanORGANIZATIONAL DEMOGRAPHY', 'MODEL', 'INNOVATION', 'DIFFUSION', 'COMMUNICATION', 'RESOURCES', 'COHESION', 'WORD']",['innovation'],social
"Redundancy provisions in Britain have failed to promote organizational regeneration or labour mobility from declining to expanding firms/industries. On the contrary, as human resources are wantonly discarded through the (mis)management of redundancy, job security and X-efficiency in the internal labour market have been severely eroded. In external labour markets, many redundant workers, the so-called 'lemons' of the labour market, are consigned to long-term unemployment because employers are wary of hiring a worker that another firm does not want. These deleterious outcomes are elaborated through detailed case studies from steel making, coal mining and port transport, where mass redundancy has proved instrumental in the process of industrial restructuring. In order to re-establish trust and security in the internal labour market, and relieve the burden of readjustment from redundant workers in the external labour market, alternative methods of managing changing labour market requirements, based on reconversion rather than redundancy, are considered in the concluding section.","['nanINDUSTRIAL-RELATIONS', 'BRITAIN']",['britain'],mobility job security unemployment
"Purpose - Despite the growing interest in reverse exchange, studies on the subject from the perspective of consumer participation and motivation remain sparse. Consumers' participation in reverse exchange is a key component of supply-chain reverse logistics. To address the gap in existing studies, this paper aims to empirically identify the intention and causes of consumer electronic product exchange (EPE). The proposed research model incorporates value-belief-norm and neutralization theories, linking consumers' values to their intentions to participate in EPE. Design/methodology/approach - Survey data collected from 250 consumers were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings - This discussion shows that people are more likely to present positive attitudes when they are ethically concerned. However, this tendency is not without exceptions and behavior influenced by ethics was not always observed. Upon examination, the findings highlight moderating forces of psychological tension that arise when people behave in ways that are in apparent contradiction to their expressed positive attitudes. Research limitations/implications - It is important to modify the model by analyzing consumers' actual EPE behaviors. Future research should also reconsider the results from a longitudinal perspective. Practical implications - The reverse logistics management practices proposed offer valuable insight into other various activities as well, including an integrated supply chain model and improving customer service. Social implications - The proposed action of EPE encourages consumers as well as managers to reduce, recycle or effectively dispose of waste. Originality/value - Current reverse exchange models are insufficient for measuring consumer motivations perspective, which is a key but inadequately researched perspective of determining the effectiveness of reverse logistics management. This research endeavors to fill this gap and augment previous studies in EPE by advancing the discussion on how the concept of reverse logistics management is evaluated and justified in relation to consumption values and psychological motivations.","['China', 'Service supply chain', 'Reverse logistics', 'Consumer motivation', 'Neutralization', 'Value-belief-normSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT', 'PLANNED BEHAVIOR', 'PURCHASE INTENTIONS', 'PERCEIVED VALUE', 'PERSONAL NORM', 'FAIR TRADE', 'GREEN', 'NEUTRALIZATION', 'LOGISTICS', 'ATTITUDE']","['reverse logistics', 'reverse logistics', 'consumer motivation', 'consumer motivation', 'neutralization', 'neutralization', 'logistics', 'attitude']",reverse logistics electronic product exchange attitudes

"Together, Penrosean and Barnean resource-based logic make up the dominant theoretical approach to understanding firm growth. While extant literature focuses on a common lineage between Penrosean theory and the resource-based view (RBV), we explicate divergence at these origins of resource-based theorizing and subject the growth implications of each to meta-analytic testing. RBV's central tenets concern resources that meet valuable, rare, inimitable, and nonsubstitutable (VRIN) criteria, while Penrose's theory discusses the versatility of resources. Theoretically, VRIN resources allow firms to exploit unique opportunities, while versatile resources allow firms to recombine resources in novel ways to create growth. Using meta-analytic techniques, we find that versatile resources are associated with higher levels of growth, whereas VRIN resources are not. We offer novel insights into alternative characteristics of resources derived from the same conceptualization of the firm, add greater specificity to the performance construct, and open up avenues for new theorizing on firm growth that is more closely aligned with Penrose's theory.","['firm growth', 'RBV', 'Penrose', 'versatility', 'fungibility', 'meta-analysisCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'EMPIRICAL-RESEARCH', 'PERFORMANCE', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'VIEW', 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP', 'CAPABILITIES', 'METAANALYSIS', 'SIZE', 'DETERMINANTS']","['firm growth', 'firm growth', 'rbv', 'penrose', 'versatility', 'performance', 'view']",firm growth resource based view
"Dual organizational identification - with both the whole corporation and the local subsidiary - is considered valuable for subsidiary employees, international assignees, and multinational corporations (MNCs). While extant research has examined antecedents of separate targets of identification, it has not fully addressed the challenge of identifying factors capable of supporting both simultaneously. This study examines the influence of individual- and organizational-level factors on the dual values-based identification of foreign subsidiary employees. Drawing on acculturation and organizational socialization theory, we test hypotheses on multilevel data from 793 managers and professionals in 90 foreign subsidiaries belonging to 11 Nordic MNCs. The results show that dual values-based identification is associated with acculturation and first-hand contact at the individual level, and a supportive social context for affective learning at the organizational level. Through its emphasis on higher-order elements that connect different parts of the MNC, rather than those that lead to the formation of in-groups and out-groups, the values-based approach to identification contributes to our understanding of dual identification in MNC subsidiaries, and represents a more positive treatment of cultural diversity. The findings have heightened practical relevance given the emphasis individuals are placing on values congruence in career choices and MNC efforts at instilling shared values.","['multinational corporations (MNCs) and enterprises (MNEs)', 'multilevel analysis', 'organizational identification', 'acculturation theory', 'organizational socializationSOCIAL IDENTITY THEORY', 'PARENT CULTURAL-CONTROL', 'MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS', 'INTERGROUP CONTACT', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTACHMENT', 'SOCIALIZATION TACTICS', 'BOUNDARY SPANNERS', 'MEDIATING ROLE', 'ACCULTURATION', 'MODEL']","['organizational identification', 'organizational identification', 'multinational corporations', 'multinational corporations', 'acculturation']",acculturation socialization cultural diversity
"We use an intercategorical approach to intersectionality to quantify pay and attainment of supervisory positions for groups of immigrants and their descendants who also vary in gender, mother tongue, and race. Using a Canadian nationally representative sample of 20,000 employees across 6000 firms, we find a $10,000 spread in annual pay between the groups with the most advantages and those experiencing the most barriers, loosely corresponding to an additive model of intersectional benefits and barriers. The effects of immigrant generation are partially mitigated by the degree to which firms are internationally-oriented, indicating that international businesses may help to reduce inequities.","['Immigrants', 'Labor market', 'Intersectional', 'Gender', 'Language', 'RaceLABOR-MARKET PERFORMANCE', 'MULTICULTURAL EMPLOYEES', 'RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION', 'CREATIVE PERFORMANCE', 'LANGUAGE-SKILLS', 'WOMEN', 'ATTRACTIVENESS', 'BICULTURALISM', 'FOREIGNNESS', 'COMPLEXITY']","['immigrants', 'intersectional', 'gender']",immigrants employees firms
"The purpose of this article is to investigate the relative role played by alertness and asymmetric information on entrepreneurial decisions. The article presents a model in which an individual decides whether to become an entrepreneur based on her alertness and on the information available in her environment. Spin-glass simulations are used to illustrate the dynamics of the decisional process. According to the results, more alert agents have higher probabilities of exhibiting entrepreneurial behavior. However, if information is evenly distributed, the number of entrepreneurs is shown to remain low even when agents are highly alert. If, on the other hand, information is not evenly distributed, entrepreneurship is shown to increase and concentrate geographically. These results are consistent with observed clustering of entrepreneurial activity. In addition, entrepreneurship is identified as a path-dependent phenomenon. As a result, the model suggests that certain political and institutional settings are more conducive to entrepreneurship than others and implies that short-term policies aimed at increasing the prevalence of entrepreneurship are likely to be ineffective.

"Although knowledge flows create value, the market often does not price them accordingly. We examine unintended'' knowledge flows that result from the cross-border movement of inventors (i.e., flows that result from the move, but do not go to the hiring firm). We find that the inventor's new country gains from her arrival above and beyond the knowledge flow benefits enjoyed by the firm that recruited her (National Learning by Immigration). Furthermore, the firm that lost the inventor also gains by receiving increased knowledge flows from that individual's new country and firm (Firm Learning from the Diaspora). Surprisingly, the latter effect is only twice as strong when the mover moves within the same multinational firm, suggesting that knowledge flows between inventors do not necessarily follow organizational boundaries, thus creating opportunities for public policy and firm strategy.","['labor mobility', 'knowledge flows', 'immigration', 'diaspora', 'inventorsRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'DEVELOPMENT SPILLOVERS', 'DETERMINANTS', 'LOCALIZATION', 'INNOVATION', 'GEOGRAPHY', 'PATENTS', 'FIRMS', 'SCOPE', 'US']","['knowledge flows', 'knowledge flows', 'immigration', 'diaspora', 'us']",market country
"A central focus of empirical research in strategic management has been to understand the relationships associated with the structure-strategy-performance paradigm. To examine these relationships, investigators have relied extensively on cross-sectional methods that embody the implicit assumption that model parameters are stable across firms and over time. Yet, many of the theoretical constructs used in strategic management have clear firm- and lime-specific components. Hence, it might be expected that the parameters of the relationships investigated empirically will vary across firms and ol er time. Whereas recent research has raised concerns about the use of cross-sectional analysis when parameters vary over time, little attention has been given to the issue of parameter variability across firms. Given the focus of strategy researchers on firm-level effects and the predominant reliance on cross-sectional analysis, accounting for across-firm variability is a significant methodological issue. Failure to account for such variability can lend to biased parameter estimates and incorrect inferences. This paper argues for the adoption of alternative methods that can over come the limitations of a cross-sectional analysis;is and it offers guidance on how researchers can proceed to use these alternative methods to explicitly incorporate or test for variation in model parameters across firms or over time.

"This study considers the mediating role of internal knowledge sharing in the relationship between two critical aspects of organizational social capital (trust and goal congruence) and entrepreneurial orientation (EO), as well as how this role might be moderated by the firm's level of formalization. It shows that higher levels of internal knowledge sharing relate to stronger EO, and such knowledge sharing in turn results from higher levels of trust and goal congruence. This study further provides a nuanced picture of the role of formalization in this process. The authors discuss both the study's implications and future research directions.","['nanRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY', 'PRODUCT INNOVATION', 'VENTURE PERFORMANCE', 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE', 'METHOD VARIANCE', 'MODERATING ROLE', 'TOP MANAGEMENT', 'DYNAMIC THEORY', 'MEDIATING ROLE']","['mediating role', 'mediating role']",knowledge sharing trust goal congruence entrepreneurial orientation formalization research directions
"In business-to-business relationships, sellers are often faced with instances of contractual breaches by buyers. In many cases, relationship factors preclude legal enforcement of contract terms, requiring sellers to explore alternate resolution options. Literature on contractual breaches has primarily focused on enforcement options based on terms specified in the contract. However, little is known about how companies deal with contractual breaches by their customers when legal enforcement is not a viable option. The authors use a grounded theory approach to investigate this important issue. Based on in-depth interviews with 40 supplier managers and executives in multiple industries, the authors identify: (a) types of out-of-contract alternatives for resolving breaches, (b) factors that lead to use of enforcement options outside the terms specified in the contract, (c) contextual influences, and (d) individual and firm-level consequences of outside-of-contract enforcement.","['Contractual breach', 'Contractual enforcement', 'Relational contracting', 'Grounded theoryENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS', 'BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS', 'SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS', 'ECONOMIC-ORGANIZATION', 'MARKET ORIENTATION', 'FORMAL CONTRACTS', 'GOVERNANCE', 'RENEGOTIATION', 'PERFORMANCE', 'EXCHANGE']","['contractual breach', 'contractual breach', 'business relationships', 'business relationships']",contractual breaches
"Haptic information, or information attained through touch by the hands, is important for the evaluation of products that vary in terms of material properties related to texture, hardness, temperature, and weight. The authors develop and propose a conceptual framework to illustrate that salience of haptic information differs significantly across products, consumers, and situations. The authors use two experiments to assess how these factors interact to impair or enhance the acquisition and use of haptic information. Barriers to touch, such as a retail display case, can inhibit the use of haptic information and consequently decrease confidence in product evaluations and increase the frustration level of consumers who are more motivated to touch products. In addition, written descriptions and visual depictions of products can partially enhance acquisition of certain types of touch information. The authors synthesize the results of these studies and discuss implications for the effect of haptic information for Internet and other nonstore retailing as well as for traditional retailers.","['nanOBJECT IDENTIFICATION', 'CONSUMER', 'EXPLORATION', 'INVOLVEMENT', 'VALIDITY', 'QUALITY', 'MODEL']",['consumer'],barriers
"Research Summary Scholars have traditionally characterized the variation in firm performance as determined by conditions after entry, where the entry decision is a one-shot binary choice determined by cost-benefit analysis. However, recent theoretical work has posited that the entry decision is an outcome of a learning process and that the information acquired during the pre-entry period shapes subsequent performance dynamics. We provide the first systematic data on the pre-entry period using a nationally representative survey. We document the activities that prospective entrants undertake, finding variation according to opportunity costs, prior experience, and confidence levels. Our results suggest the pre-entry period is shaped by a series of choices by prospective entrants as they contemplate entry, further exploration, or ending the entrepreneurial process. Managerial Summary We created and implemented a nationally representative survey on the entrepreneurial activities of Americans. Several interesting findings emerged. First, approximately a third of Americans report having had a business idea in the past 5 years, motivated in the vast majority of cases by lifestyle concerns rather than the pursuit of significant business opportunities. Fewer than half of those who considered starting a business take even the lowest cost steps, like searching the Internet for potential competitors or speaking with a friend. Our findings reveal an entrepreneurial process which involves a significant pre-entry period where prospective entrepreneurs seek to acquire information about the quality of their idea, perform administrative tasks to prepare for launch and encounter frictions that impede their progress.","['entrepreneurial strategy', 'entrepreneurship', 'entry', 'learning', 'survey methodsEMPLOYEE MOBILITY', 'ENTRY', 'CREATION', 'EXPERIMENTATION', 'CAPABILITIES', 'INNOVATION', 'RESOURCES', 'EVOLUTION', 'GROWTH', 'EXIT']","['entry', 'learning', 'entry']",entry
"Since the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 1998, Korea has experienced a dramatic influx of foreign capital directed toward ailing Korean firms. This study shows how three Western companies integrated the human resources and organizational cultures of their Korean target firms and how Korean employees responded to the implemented changes. Data revealed that changes in human resource management and organizational culture were not only tolerated but even appreciated by the employees of Korean target firms. However, organizational culture changes encouraging more individualism and contradicting Confucian values were negatively perceived.

"This study examines how different types of venture capital relate to new venture internationalization. Using a sample of 646 U.S. new ventures that executed IPOs between 1995 and 2010, we find that ventures with foreign or corporate venture capital have higher levels of international intensity. We also investigate the moderating role of VC reputation on the relationship between foreign venture capital and international intensity and corporate venture capital and international intensity.

"Research Summary To examine whether firms use corporate social responsibility (CSR) to insure against stock price risk, we exploit an exogenous shock in stock price risk associated with Regulation SHO whereby the SEC randomly selected pilot firms for which the uptick restriction on short sales no longer applied. A difference-in-differences test reveals that pilot firms increased CSR more than nonpilot firms and that in particular they reduced CSR concerns and increased CSR that impacts stakeholders involved in direct resource exchange. We also find that pilot firm CSR reduced short positions against them and that the effect is stronger for CSR concerns and CSR that impacts directly connected stakeholders. Overall, we document a causal effect of stock price risk on managerial incentives to invest in CSR for risk management. Managerial Summary Corporate social responsibility has many purported benefits, one of which is that it can insure against the adverse stock price effects of negative events. But do managers purposefully use CSR in this way and do such investments provide intended insurance-like benefits? By taking advantage of a natural experiment where a randomly selected set of pilot firms were exposed to elevated short-sale risk unleashed by the SEC regulation, we find evidence that they do. Once the SEC initiated the regulatory change, firms that faced greater risk increased CSR more than firms that did not. In addition, increased CSR lowered short interests in pilot firms' stocks and this reduction is attributable to the insurance-like effect of CSR rather than simply prevention of adverse events.","['CSR', 'insurance-like effect', 'resource allocation', 'short selling', 'stock price riskFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'SHAREHOLDER VALUE', 'EMPIRICAL-TEST', 'MANAGEMENT', 'PHILANTHROPY', 'CSR']","['csr', 'insurance like effect', 'insurance like effect', 'insurance like effect', 'management', 'csr']",corporate social responsibility management
"The current study extends prior research on emotional dynamics within the workplace by examining workplace correlates of within-person affect spina form of variability in affect states. Drawing from affective events theory, the current study tests both concurrent and lagged associations between work events, daily affect spin, mood, and daily voluntary workplace behaviors in a 2-week daily diary study of 114 working adults. Multilevel analyses demonstrated that levels of daily affect spin were higher on days in which employees experienced mixed work events (i.e., both positive and negative work events on the same day) compared to days with only positive work events or no work events. Results revealed that daily affect spin was indirectly related to daily organizational citizenship behavior through lower pleasant mood. Lagged analyses suggest the effects of daily spin on mood and voluntary work behaviors may not carry over to the next day. Our findings build upon prior between-person research on affect spin by providing evidence that affect spin can be meaningfully assessed at the within-person level of analysis. Moreover, this article extends prior research and theory by showing that affect spin is an important correlate of workplace events, mood, and voluntary work behavior at the within-person level.","['affect spin', 'work events', 'counterproductive work behaviors', 'organizational citizenship behaviors', 'experience sampling methodINDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES', 'INTRAINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-BEHAVIOR', 'COGNITIVE-DISSONANCE', 'CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR', 'MOOD SPILLOVER', 'POSITIVE MOOD', 'CORE AFFECT', 'MODEL']","['affect spin', 'affect spin', 'work events', 'work events', 'citizenship behavior', 'citizenship behavior']",within person affect mood
"One of the main reasons that firms participate in alliances is to learn know-how and capabilities from their alliance partners. At the same time firms want to protect themselves from the opportunistic behavior of their partner to retain their own core proprietary assets. Most research has generally viewed the achievement of these objectives as mutually exclusive. In contrast, we provide empirical evidence using large-sample survey data to show that when firms build relational capital in conjunction with an integrative approach to managing conflict, they are able to achieve both objectives simultaneously. Relational capital based on mutual trust and interaction at the individual level between alliance partners creates a basis for learning and know-how transfer across the exchange interface. At the same time, it curbs opportunistic behavior of alliance partners, thus preventing the leakage of critical know-how between them.

"Despite the prominence of industrial services in the global economy. few studies have addressed the characteristics and purchasing processes of buyers in business-to-business markets or for services. Cross-national data is used to explore the extent to which national culture (based on the firms' national origin and its location of operation) and network relationships (organization buying experience, types of referral sources used) are related to the use of direct versus indirect purchasing processes for various types of industrial services. Our results show the presence of three unique market segments based on purchasing process-networkers who are heavy referral users, opportunists who purchase services both directly and indirectly. and independents who are heavy direct purchasers of certain types of services. Interestingly, the segments are comprised of companies that are both American and Japanese, located in both Japan and the U.S., with and without previous buying experience. Furthermore, we identify the types of referral sources consulted depending on who and where buyers are and what services are being purchased. Implications for targeting national and global commercial service customers are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

"Online reviews on mobile app marketplaces help consumers evaluate whether a mobile app fits their needs before upgrading or purchasing it. This study explores how online reviews influence trial attitude formation, a process that naturally bears on cognitive structure as much as on users' emotional responses to online experience. We experimentally manipulate the valence (positive vs. negative) and consistency (one-sided vs. two-sided) of online reviews exposed to participants in a laboratory-controlled app trial scenario considering two different aspects of use (hedonic and functional). We find that review valence and consistency alter the emotional process during trial attitude formation but do not affect the cognitive process. In particular, negative reviews compared to positive reviews and two-sided reviews compared to one-sided reviews are more influential in trial attitude formation. Interestingly, two-sided reviews weaken the emotional process during the use of functional apps, but strengthen it during the use of hedonic apps. The study contributes to the literature by identifying the moderating role of online reviews on product trial experience, which in turn influences the formation of product attitudes. The findings help app developers and marketers understand how to elicit positive evaluations during app trials by highlighting the importance of online reviews.","['Electronic word of mouth', 'eWOM', 'mobile applications', 'mobile apps', 'online ratings', 'online reviews', 'product evaluation', 'review consistency', 'review valence', 'software trialsWORD-OF-MOUTH', 'CONSUMER REVIEWS', 'PRODUCT-TRIAL', 'GENDER-DIFFERENCES', 'DIRECT EXPERIENCE', 'INFORMATION', 'IMPACT', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'SEARCH', 'MODELS']","['online reviews', 'online reviews', 'review valence', 'review valence', 'product trial', 'product trial']",online experience online
"There is a widely held view that the performance affirms depends not only on the ability of managers to exploit economic markets but also on their ability to succeed in political markets. To test the value of political activism, recent scholarship has probed the impact of corporate political activity (CPA) on firm performance. However, mixed findings and the fragmented nature of the field raise more questions than answers as to the nature of this relationship. This systematic review examines scholarly articles for evidence of the impact of CPA on firm value. The findings suggest that CPA is more valuable in emerging countries and that relational CPA strategies are more common in emerging (versus developed) countries where social capital underlies political and economic exchange. We also document the paucity of research on informational CPA strategies and policy outcomes in the emerging country context.

"We investigate whether large family groups in emerging economies can proactively change their environment. We use a coevolutionary approach, which accounts for the influence of context on the entrepreneur and for the freedom of the latter to modify it. We find that entrepreneurs can shape institutions to their advantage, illustrated by the Salim Group, which achieved growth by aligning with and influencing politicians, eventually 'morphing into an institution'. We unravel unique coevolutionary patterns, which we use to extend existing theories. Our first contribution is to initiate a new line of inquiry in coevolution theory, focusing on individual companies coevolving with institutions. Secondly, we document factors that increase and decrease strategic choice for family groups in emerging economies. Thirdly, we find that the Salim Group became part of the crony Suharto regime. The group became both an institutional entrepreneur and an entrepreneurial institution, demonstrating that companies and institutions are not necessarily mutually exclusive.","['nanBUSINESS GROUPS', 'ORGANIZATIONAL COEVOLUTION', 'STRATEGIC CHOICE', 'EVOLUTION', 'OWNERSHIP', 'FRAMEWORK', 'DYNAMICS', 'MARKETS', 'MODEL', 'FIRMS']","['strategic choice', 'strategic choice', 'evolution']",coevolutionary institutions
"Among researchers interested in organizations and management, some of those who use cognitive mapping share a common objective: to improve organizational action. Some intervene directly at the level of the organization while others prefer to achieve this indirectly, by working at the individual level. Nevertheless those who work at the individual level rely on the 'emancipatory' properties of a cognitive map, which facilitates reflectiveness. After calling upon the notions of natural logic, schematization, contextuality, representation, knowledge and schema to characterize the cognitive map and its construction, we present a case, that of the idiosyncratic map of the owner-manager of a small business. We describe the mode of construction of the map and its content. A critical discussion follows underlining the traps to avoid, the elements to be improved and those that should be kept for construction of future idiosyncratic maps.","['nanINFLUENCE DIAGRAMS', 'MANAGEMENT']",['management'],organizations logic knowledge
"Firms increasingly use cross-functional teams to develop new products, yet we know little about the processes that make teams excel. Although studies have focused on within-team processes like cooperation between and integration of individuals from various functional areas, some emerging literature suggests that the processes that make teams excel are richer and more complex than cooperation and integration. In order to capture the processes that lead to excellent market performance of new products, we introduce the concept of charged team behavior, the extent to which cross-functional product development teams are enthusiastically and jointly driven to develop superior new products. Charged team behavior captures not only the drive, commitment, and joy of team members, but also their collaborative behaviors to achieve an exceptional outcome. We propose and test a series of hypotheses concerning how charged behavior affects new product market performance and how charged behavior is, in turn, influenced by both team structural characteristics (physical proximity, team longevity, and outcome interdependence) and contextual factors (senior management encouragement to take risk, quality orientation, exposure to customer input. extent of competition, and interdepartmental connectedness). It is particularly important to examine the antecedents of charged behavior because there are concerns that some of the team-related factors generally considered to be useful for teams may not necessarily lead to charged teams. Data from new consumer product development teams is analyzed though structural equation modeling for hypothesis testing. We find evidence that highly charged teams are more likely to develop successful new products. Results also indicate that outcome interdependence, exposure to customer input, extent of competition, and interdepartmental connectedness are positively related to charged behavior. Physical proximity, team longevity, encouragement to take risk, and quality orientation do not improve teams' charged behavior. Data suggests that charged team behavior: 1) fully mediates the effects of outcome interdependence and interdepartmental connectedness on performance, 2) partially mediates the influence of exposure to customer input and the extent of competition on performance, and 3) does not mediate the effects of quality orientation and physical proximity on performance. Our study highlights the importance of creating highly charged product development teams in order to achieve exceptional performance. Further. our results indicate that some of the factors suggested by traditional social psychology research for enhancing team effectiveness (e.g., physical proximity and team longevity) may not necessarily create charged teams. Instead, charged teams need a special arrangement, in which members are accountable to the ream and where their evaluations and rewards are also linked to the performance of the team. In addition, although a strong emphasis on quality is considered to be beneficial for new products, as our results indicate, such emphasis cannot create a charged atmosphere. Moreover, our research suggests that if the organization structure does not permit frequent contact between individuals across functional boundaries, the creation of a strongly charged team and development of a successful new product will be hindered.

"Research Summary Variance decomposition methods allow strategy scholars to identify key sources of heterogeneity in firm performance. However, most extant approaches produce estimates that depend on the order in which sources are considered, the ways they are nested, and which sources are treated as fixed or random effects. In this paper, we propose the use of an axiomatically justified, unique, and effective solution to this limitation: the Shapley Value approach. We show its effectiveness compared to extant methods using both simulated and real data, and use it to explore how the importance of business group effects varies with group diversification and internationalization in a large, representative sample of European firms. We thus demonstrate the method's superior accuracy and its usefulness in asking and answering new questions. Managerial Summary A key contribution of strategic management research to managerial practice is identifying drivers of firm performance that operate at firm, corporation, industry, and national levels. A branch of this research measures the relative importance of factors at these different levels in producing variation in firm performance, thus helping top managers focus efforts on aspects of their businesses most likely to yield performance differences. However, estimates produced by extant methods are sensitive to method used, and to modeling choices made. This paper proposes the use of the Shapley Value approach, which is free from such sensitivity, shows its effectiveness compared to extant methods, and uses it to explore how the importance of factors at the level of the business group varies with group diversification and internationalization.","['corporate group', 'diversification', 'internationalization', 'Shapley value regression', 'variance decompositionBUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE', 'SUBNATIONAL REGION MATTER', 'RELATIVE IMPORTANCE', 'COORDINATION COSTS', 'DOMINANCE ANALYSIS', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'INDUSTRY', 'MARKETS', 'PREDICTORS', 'COMPONENTS']","['diversification', 'internationalization', 'relative importance', 'relative importance', 'firm performance', 'firm performance', 'industry']",variance firm performance shapley value business group diversification
"We use internalization theory to analyze the establishment and entry mode decisions of state-owned (SOE) and privately owned (POE) enterprises. We enrich internalization theory by building on insights from economic theory of corporate governance and taking into account particular characteristics of SOEs such as non-economic motivations, long-term orientation, and different risk preferences. We examine foreign entries over a 10-year period in the Canadian oil and gas industry. This single-country and single-industry context features foreign SOEs and POEs from a wide range of home countries, allowing a focused study of the combined influence of state ownership and home-country factors. Compared to POEs, SOEs tend to prefer acquiring stand-alone assets rather than firms, and to take lower ownership shares. We also find that differences between SOEs and POEs diminish when home countries are characterized by high government quality and market orientation and identify differences between types of SOEs, with partially owned SOEs exhibiting behaviors more similar to POEs than fully owned SOEs. We demonstrate how our enrichment of internalization theory strengthens its predictive and explanatory capacity. Our results also show that SOEs from strong and market-oriented institutional environments are similar to POEs and can be studied using the traditional internalization theory.","['state ownership', 'internalization theory', 'corporate governance', 'foreign market entry', 'multinational enterprise', 'oil and gas industryINTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS', 'OWNED ENTERPRISES', 'DIRECT-INVESTMENT', 'MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISES', 'AGENCY PERSPECTIVE', 'NATURAL-RESOURCES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MODE', 'MARKET', 'FIRMS']","['state ownership', 'state ownership', 'internalization theory', 'internalization theory', 'corporate governance', 'corporate governance', 'mode', 'market', 'firms']",internalization theory entry orientation market orientation

"This research investigates situations in which frontline employees deliberately restrict customers' access to touch products on display (active interpersonal haptic blocking), and how this understudied form of sensory blocking may increase customers' downstream purchasing. While previous research examines the benefits of increased product touch, we temporarily block touch for specific products in display areas and then investigate the subsequent impact on customer behavior. Through four studies, including a retail field experiment, we find that when an employee asks a customer not to touch a product on display, this initiates a serial mediation process which: (1) engenders feelings of psychological reactance that result in (2) increased compensatory touching of subsequently encountered products to counterbalance a loss of sensory freedom, and (3) increased spending and purchasing once the customer leaves the reactance-inducing encounter. Effects are moderated by socioeconomic status (SES) and need for touch (NFT) whereby psychological reactance was significantly stronger for high SES customers with a moderate or high NFT when actively blocked. Results also demonstrate that active interpersonal haptic blocking does not result in more negative attitudes toward retailers, thus retailers might consider implementing this counterintuitive practice to encourage downstream sales.

"Motivated by the international business literature that examines the interactions between organizations, corruption, and political forces, we examine whether and how government connections affect small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) credit access around the world. Using a sample of SMEs across 30 developing countries, we show that SMEs with government connections are significantly less likely to be discouraged from approaching banks for a loan as compared to SMEs without such connections. However, connected SMEs do not receive preferential lending from banks. Moreover, the nature of this effect depends on the institutional setting. Specifically, the effect becomes stronger in countries with high levels of corruption, suggesting that government connections are substitutes for poorly functioning formal institutions. Our findings have important implications for policies targeted at reducing corruption, improving access to financing, facilitating entrepreneurship, and attracting foreign investment.","['government connections', 'small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)', 'access to finance', 'discouraged borrowers', 'institutional theory', 'corruptionPOLITICAL CONNECTIONS', 'FIRMS', 'INSTITUTIONS', 'PERFORMANCE']","['government connections', 'government connections', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'small and medium sized enterprises smes ', 'institutions']",corruption government connections banks
"Purpose - The growing scale and scope of the supply chain requires a greater understanding of the broader supply chain skills picture. This study aims to assess the supply chain skills needs within the context of a UK-based higher education institution involving graduates, academics and employers to appreciate the graduate skills demands of modern supply chains. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed methods study entailing in-depth interviews with academics followed by a questionnaire distributed to graduates and employers has been designed and utilised. Findings - The findings indicate that the changing supply chain scope encourages the requisition and development of different supply chain skills with varied levels of emphases in relation to 25 skills identified in the literature. Key graduate skills needs are highlighted, including time management, collaborative learning, teamwork and problem solving, with the addition of two supply chain skill areas, namely specialist training and the understanding and application of regulations. The findings of the current study present a limited emphasis on information technology (IT) skills, despite the significant IT advancements and changes in supply chains. Research limitations/implications - The study has been carried out in a UK university delivering undergraduate supply chain management courses. It would be beneficial to test whether the findings are exemplary across other supply chain courses and to investigate the integration of these skills within the supply chain syllabus and how employers, graduates and academic parties could actively engage in developing the agenda for future supply chain skills needs. Practical implications - This research paper highlights the gaps in supply chain skills, which inevitably puts considerable pressure on operatives and managers whose responsibility it is to ensure compliance with regulations and professional bodies. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the supply chain skills discussion and reports subject relevant challenges for supply chain educators by engaging three key stakeholders - graduate employers, graduates and academics. The findings have generated additional supply chain skills to the academic literature, in addition to providing an understanding of the weighting of skills in terms of their importance and application to industry needs.","['Skills', 'UK', 'Supply-chain management', 'EducationLOGISTICS', 'MANAGEMENT', 'EDUCATION', 'INDUSTRY', 'FUTURE', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'INTEGRATION', 'EVOLUTION', 'PROJECTS', 'AGENDA']","['skills', 'uk', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'supply chain management', 'management', 'education', 'industry', 'future', 'integration', 'agenda']",supply chain higher employers information technology university
"This study of 145 managers of a large biotechnology/agricultural company examined how leaders' emotion recognition ability and personality characteristics influenced performance of transformational leadership behavior. Emotion recognition, positive affectivity, and agreeableness positively predicted such behavior. In addition, extraversion moderated the relationship between emotion recognition and transformational leadership. We also provided construct validity evidence for transformational leadership behavior by showing differing effects of these antecedents on contingent reward behavior. The study provides empirical support for the contribution of emotion and personality to transformational leadership behavior.","['nanTRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP', 'CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP', 'MEMBER EXCHANGE', '5-FACTOR MODEL', 'POSITIVE MOOD', 'INTELLIGENCE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'OUTCOMES', 'TRAIT', 'PERCEPTIONS']",['performance'],emotion recognition ability personality transformational leadership
"Purpose This paper aims to examines the moderating effect of small vs large supply base size on the relationship between strategic sustainable purchasing (SSP) and organizational sustainability performance (OSP). SSP is conceptualized as a dynamic capability consisting of strategic purchasing and environmental purchasing. Environmental collaboration is conceptualized as a mediator between SSP and OSP. Extant research has not examined the effect of the size of the supply base on the relationship between SSP and OSP. Design/methodology/approach The hypothesized relationships are tested using a two-step multi-group analysis in partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings A small supply base size positively moderates the relationship between SSP and environmental collaboration, thus achieving OSP. In contrast, when the supply base is large, strategic purchasing is positively associated with environmental collaboration, while environmental purchasing is negatively related to environmental collaboration. A large supply base has a positive relationship to environmental collaboration and economic sustainability, while the relationship between environmental collaboration and environmental and social performance is not significant. Practical implications This research argues that despite the nuances in the moderating effects of small versus large supply base size, managers need to invest in both dynamic and relational capabilities to achieve organizational sustainability. Originality/value Scant research is available in supply chain management research that has examined the important effect of the supply base size on the relationship between SSP and OSP. This research aims to fill this gap. The study helps practitioners understand the effects of supply base sizes for their organizations, increase interrelationships among suppliers, reduce the level of differentiation among them, and, thereby, reduce costs and increase revenues.","['Strategic sustainable purchasing', 'Organizational sustainability performance', 'Supply base size', 'Organizational capabilities', 'Multi-group analysis', 'Performance', 'Sustainability', 'Supplier relationships', 'Dynamic capabilitiesCHAIN MANAGEMENT', 'COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE', 'CONCEPTUAL-MODEL', 'GREEN PRACTICES', 'RESOURCE', 'INTEGRATION', 'NETWORK', 'IMPACT', 'FIRMS', 'CAPABILITIES']","['strategic sustainable purchasing', 'strategic sustainable purchasing', 'strategic sustainable purchasing', 'organizational sustainability performance', 'organizational sustainability performance', 'organizational sustainability performance', 'supply base size', 'supply base size', 'supply base size', 'multi group analysis', 'multi group analysis', 'multi group analysis', 'performance', 'sustainability', 'capabilities']",base size strategic sustainable purchasing sustainability performance environmental collaboration management
"Much of the literature on inter-organizational relations assumes that firms operate as relatively autonomous and cohesive units that are (1) unimpeded by wider institutional norms governing the industry as a whole, and (2) allow little or no role for the boundary spanning agents who oversee and monitor 'contracts' on a daily basis. This perspective is not surprising given that so many studies rely solely on questionnaires completed by a single respondent within one or more of the organizations. Nor has there been much recognition of the dynamic interplay between forces at the institutional, organizational and interpersonal levels. In order to address these issues, we propose a framework that explicitly focuses on forces at these three levels, as well as the interplay between them, in order to analyse how and why inter-organizational relations take the forms they do. We argue that trusting, OCR-type relations are more likely to be produced and reproduced when there are strong institutional forces promoting common obligations on both parties, and there is a relative mutuality of power relations between the organizations. However, because the contract is maintained by boundary spanning agents, agreed norms at the institutional and organizational levels are a necessary but not sufficient factor for OCR to develop. Conversely, in the absence of these forces, there is less incentive for either organization to establish and maintain close interpersonal relations, and indeed ACR-type, distant relations may be beneficial for organizations and individuals that wish to dispense with existing contracts.","['nanINTERFIRM', 'COOPERATION', 'ALLIANCES', 'BUSINESS', 'COLLABORATION', 'PARTNERSHIP', 'EMPLOYMENT', 'CONTRACT', 'LINK']",['contract'],industry power
"In this paper, we complement social cognitive theory with psychological theories on grief in our discussion of two approaches to grief management - grief regulation and grief normalization that hold promise for enabling corporate entrepreneurs to cope with negative emotions induced by project failure. We propose that to the extent that organizational members have high self-efficacy for recovering from grief over project failure, or this coping self-efficacy can be built through the social support offered by the organizational environment, regulating rather than eliminating, grief via normalization processes will explain superior learning and motivational Outcomes.

"Purpose - This paper aims to provide the results of a large-scale survey of courses dedicated to the field of logistics in higher education. This research is unique because it represents the first large-scale study of both undergraduate and graduate logistics courses. Design/methodology/approach - Content analysis was performed on each syllabus to identify the actual course coverage: requirements, pedagogy and content emphasis. Content analysis is a descriptive approach to categorize data and the results may be limited by the categorizations used in analysis. This aggregated information was utilized to compare historical research findings in this area with the current skills identified as important for career success. These data provide input for gap analysis between offerings in higher education and those needs identified by practitioners. Findings - Data gathering efforts yielded a sample of 118 logistics courses representing 77 schools and six different countries. The aggregate number of topics covered in undergraduate courses totalled 95, while graduate courses covered 81 different topics. The primary evaluation techniques include the traditional exams, projects and homework. Details regarding learning objectives and grading schema are provided along with a gap analysis between the coverage of logistics courses and the needs identified by practitioners. Originality/value - The goal is to use these data as a means of continuous improvement in the quality and value of the educational experience. The findings are designed to foster information sharing and provide data for benchmarking efforts in the development of logistics courses and curricula in academia as well as training and development by professionals in the field of logistics.","['Logistics education', 'Benchmarking', 'Supply chain management', 'Curriculum', 'Syllabi', 'Higher educationnan']",['benchmarking'],

"We present a conceptual framework that organizes current thinking regarding increased interactivity in the electronic marketplace and its implications for product migration. Product migration refers to the extent of reliance by buyers and sellers on the electronic marketplace for activities pertaining to information search, purchase, acquisition, use, and disposal of a product. We posit that value outcomes derived by buyers and sellers from increasing interactivity mediate the relationship between interactivity and product migration. The relationship between interactivity and value outcomes for buyers and sellers is moderated by three sets of product-related characteristics: the core characteristics of the product, its purchase and use-related characteristics, and market characteristics. Inertia and resistance exhibited by buyers and sellers negatively impact product migration to the electronic marketplace and also attenuate the impact of value outcomes on product migration. In addition to guiding theoretical and empirical work in this emerging area, the proposed framework can also be employed to structure a firm's strategic discussions related to the electronic marketplace.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reflect upon the impact of the original work and provide an updated model to reflect the changing environment for supply chains. In 2000, a migratory model for supply chain evolution was proposed. Design/methodology/approach - The authors start by analysing the content of the papers that have cited the original Christopher and Towill (2000) paper. The development of an updated migratory model is informed by the findings from this, and then demonstrated through a case study of the book supply chain. Findings - Despite being the major contribution, the majority of citing papers actually use other parts of the original work, and some potential reasons for this are proposed. An extra stage is added to the migratory model, reflecting a customer centric strategy. Research limitations/implications - Given that the migratory model appears under-researched, the authors identify this as an opportunity for future research and suggest that methods less common in supply chain management are used. Practical implications - The updated migratory model can be used by supply chain managers to develop appropriate supply chain strategies for their organisations, while emphasising that many of the underlying tools to enable this reflect traditional industrial engineering approaches. Originality/value - The updated migratory model represents a new contribution to understanding the evolution of supply chains.","['Lean', 'Strategy', 'Agile', 'Customer value', 'LeagileAGILE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'INDUSTRY', 'LEANNESS', 'GREEN']","['strategy', 'management']",evolution strategy supply chain management
"Biased listing is the practice of listing items in electronic marketplaces according to criteria other than the normally expected ones (e.g., relevance or quality). This study investigates the existence, nature, and implications of biased listing effects using the case of an on-line hotel distribution platform. The study is based on real-life booking data provided by Hotel.de, the second-largest hotel-booking platform in Europe, which lists hotels according to the value of their contracts. The contribution of the study is threefold: (1) it reveals the existence of biased listing effects in an e-marketplace for products and services; (2) it explores the nature and functioning of biased listing as a combination of ranking and labeling effects, revealing a crowding-out effect that affects hotels that do not switch to higher-value contracts; (3) it discusses the implications and strategic options for the market parties. The study shows how market providers that engage in biased listing practices are able to exploit their gatekeeper position by making suppliers compete for listing positions on the platform. This research contributes to a better understanding of the role of e-marketplaces as gatekeepers between supply and demand and, at the same time, is part of a wider context of research on consumer decision-making in information-rich decision situations.","['Biased listing', 'cybermediaries', 'e-marketplaces', 'on-line hotel distribution', 'page rank', 'ranking effects', 're-intermediation', 'searchSEARCH COSTS', 'E-COMMERCE', 'INFORMATION', 'BUSINESS', 'QUALITY']","['biased listing', 'biased listing', 'e marketplaces', 'e marketplaces', 'on line hotel distribution', 'on line hotel distribution', 'on line hotel distribution', 'on line hotel distribution', 'information', 'quality']",biased listing marketplaces distribution contracts
"Given that organizations make choices about how to manage their human resources, information about the organization is often expressed or implied in the human resource systems that organizations implement. This study proposes that information conveyed through human resource systems affects applicant job choices, that particular systems will be more important to some people than to others, and that job acceptance will be influenced by the degree to which individual characteristics match the content of the system information presented. A policy-capturing design was used to assess the effects of human resource systems within the context of other variables that past research has shown to significantly influence job choices. Results suggested support for the importance of human resource systems in job choice decisions, and further suggested that the fit between individual characteristics and organizational settings described by these systems may be particularly important determinants of job acceptance.","['nanPERSON-ENVIRONMENT FIT', 'WORK FAMILY CONFLICT', 'ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE', 'VALUES', 'PEOPLE', 'CHOICE', 'MODEL', 'HYPOTHESIS', 'MOTIVATION', 'CONGRUENCE']","['people', 'choice']",systems
"international diversification is a growth strategy that has a major potential impact on firm performance. The relationship between international diversification and firm performance has been extensively studied in the international strategy literature. A major gap in the literature has been the non-existence of studies that have examined the effect of international diversification on performance in service firms. Previous studies that have tested the international diversification-performance relationship were based on samples of manufacturing firms. We argue that the form of the relationship between multinationality and performance is different in service firms. We provide a theoretical argument for this claim and hypothesize that there is a U-shaped curvilinear relationship between multinationality and performance in service firms. Our sample consists of 81 major German service firms, spanning across four industries. Results show that there is support for a U-shaped curvilinear relationship.

"State-owned enterprises represent approximately 10% of global gross domestic product. Yet they remain relatively underexplored by management scholars. Firms have often been viewed dichotomously as either state owned or privately owned. Today, however, we encourage a more nuanced view of state-owned enterprises as hybrid organizations, in which the levels of ownership and control by the state can vary. Drawing on 36 cases from four industries in 23 countries, we lay the groundwork for a richer understanding of state-owned enterprises by management scholars in the future.","['nanAGENCY-THEORY', 'CORPORATE GOVERNANCE', 'INSTITUTIONAL-THEORY', 'EMERGING ECONOMIES', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'GROUNDED THEORY', 'ANGEL AGENTS', 'HONG-KONG', 'CHINA', 'OWNERSHIP']",['ownership'],state owned enterprises organizations
"Many studies highlight the challenges facing incumbent firms in responding effectively to major technological transitions. Though some authors argue that these challenges can be overcome by firms possessing what have been called dynamic capabilities, little work has described in detail the critical resources that these capabilities leverage or the processes through which these resources accumulate and evolve. This paper explores these issues through an in-depth exploratory case study of one firm that has demonstrated consistently strong performance in an industry that is highly dynamic and uncertain. The focus for the present study is Microsoft, the leading firm in the software industry. The focus on Microsoft is motivated by providing evidence that the firm's product performance has been consistently strong over a period of time in which there have been several major technological transitions-one indicator that a firm possesses dynamic capabilities. This argument is supported by showing that Microsoft's performance when developing new products in response to one of these transitions-the growth of the World Wide Web-was superior to a sample of both incumbents and new entrants. Qualitative data are presented on the roots of Microsoft's dynamic capabilities, focusing on the way that the firm develops, stores, and evolves its intellectual property. Specifically, Microsoft codifies knowledge in the form of software components,'' which can be leveraged across multiple product lines over time and accessed by firms developing complementary products. The present paper argues that the process of componentization, the component libraries'' that result, the architectural frameworks that de. ne how these components interact, and the processes through which these components are evolved to address environmental changes represent critical resources that enable the firm to respond to major technological transitions. These arguments are illustrated by describing Microsoft's response to two major technological transitions.","['nanDYNAMIC CAPABILITIES', 'PRODUCT-DEVELOPMENT', 'FIRM', 'ENVIRONMENTS', 'MODULARITY', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'FAILURE', 'TIME']","['firm', 'knowledge', 'time']",
"Research summary: We develop and test a contingency theory of the influence of top management team (TMT) performance-contingent incentives on manager-shareholder interest alignment. Our results support our theory by showing that although TMTs engage in significantly higher levels of acquisition investment when their average incentive levels increase, investors' responses to those large investments are generally negative. More importantly, however, we further find that within-TMT incentive heterogeneity conditions that effect, such that investors evaluate TMTs' large acquisition investments more positively as the variance in those top managers' incentive values increases. Thus, within-TMT incentive heterogeneity appears to increase manager-shareholder interest alignment, in the context of large acquisition investments. Managerial summary: We find that as the average value of TMTs' incentives increase, relative to their total pay, they invest more in acquisitions and investors' respond negatively to the announcement of those deals. However, we further show that investors respond more positively to acquisitions announced by TMTs whose members' incentive values vary (some TMT members hold higher incentives and others hold lower). Results imply that when TMT members hold differing incentives levels, they approach investments from divergent perspectives, scrutinize those investments more heavily, and make better decisions, relative to TMTs with similar incentives. They also suggest that boards seeking tighter manager-shareholder interest alignmentmay benefit from introducing variance into TMT members' incentive structures, as doing so appears to create divergent preferences that can improve team decision making.

"Immigrant owners possess valuable human and social capital from which small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) might derive advantages when internationalizing. According to this resource-based perspective, such advantages might be manifested in immigrant-owned SMEs' enhanced ability to identify, evaluate, develop and exploit opportunities in international markets. However, a cognitive perspective offers an opposing view: insofar as immigrant owners are more prone to overconfidence than their non-immigrant counterparts when making internationalization decisions, immigrant-owned SMEs might reap less financial rewards from potentially high-risk international markets. We pit the two perspectives against each other theoretically and empirically by evaluating a) the relationship between business owners' immigrant background and SMEs' export intensity, and b) the extent to which such background moderates the relationship between SMEs' export intensity and (risk-adjusted) financial performance. Based on a representative sample of 9977 Canadian SMEs, we find that the presence of immigrant owners positively impacts export intensity, but negatively moderates the relationship between export intensity and financial performance. We interpret this evidence, combined with supplementary analyses, as support for a cognitive theory of international entrepreneurship in general, and particularly in relation to the role and consequences of entrepreneurs' immigrant background.","['Cognitive perspective', 'Export intensity-performance relationship', 'Immigrant owners', 'Overconfidence', 'Resource-based perspectiveSTRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING', 'MARKET ENTRY', 'ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITIES', 'PRIOR KNOWLEDGE', 'NORTH-AMERICA', 'SOCIAL TIES', 'FIRMS', 'INTERNATIONALIZATION', 'OVERCONFIDENCE', 'PERFORMANCE']","['cognitive perspective', 'cognitive perspective', 'immigrant owners', 'immigrant owners', 'overconfidence', 'internationalization', 'overconfidence', 'performance']",immigrant resource perspective overconfidence export intensity performance
"There has been much controversy concerning the relationship between outside CEO succession origin and firm performance. Some scholars take the organizational-adaptation view to highlight the benefits of outside succession; yet others adopt the organizational-disruption view to pose the selection of an outsider CEO as a disruptive and disadvantageous event for organizations. In this study, we develop an integrated multilevel framework that reconciles these opposing perspectives and examines the conditions under which the benefits of outside CEO succession outweigh the costs. Data from 109 CEO succession events in large international firms show that the performance advantages of outside succession materialize when the new CEO: (a) socio-demographically resembles incumbent executives, (b) possesses a variety of experience, and (c) is hired by a well-performing firm operating in a munificent industry. Overall, our research demonstrates that the performance implications of new CEO origin should not be considered in isolation, but in interaction with multilevel characteristics.","['CEO succession', 'firm performance', 'top management teams', 'multilevel', 'strategic leadershipTOP MANAGEMENT', 'EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION', 'INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE', 'ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE', 'UPPER ECHELONS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'LEADER', 'CONTINGENCY', 'DISSIMILARITY', 'ENVIRONMENTS']","['ceo succession', 'ceo succession', 'firm performance', 'firm performance', 'multilevel']",ceo succession performance organizational adaptation organizational disruption

In addition, they investigate the role of internal volatility (turbulence within an organization) in shaping manifest conflict Based on a large-scale, multi-informant empirical study, the authors identify the more effective of these six integrating mechanisms. Furthermore, they argue and demonstrate these mechanisms are differentially effective across the marketing-finance, marketing-manufacturing, and marketing-R&D interfaces.

"The discretionary efforts of employees to go above and beyond illustrated by organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) provide an important path to organizational success. Organizational work environment characteristics, notably, organizational climates, serve as fundamental mechanisms for eliciting OCBs. However, existing research on organizational climate and OCBs frequently adopts a variable-centered approach that breaks down climate into individual dimensions. In contrast to past research, our goal is to respond to calls to more fully contextualize organizational climate by offering a configuration of climate attributes. Drawing on a typology of research problematizing, we replace the metaphor of individual dimensions with a metaphor of a climate configuration. To theorize and test the relationship between organizational climate and OCBs, we examine organizational values embodied in the competing values framework through a mesolevel organizational climate perspective. Building on the literature on managing paradox, we propose a constructive organizational values climate configuration, which captures how the different dimensions of the competing values framework coexist and work together. In turn, we propose that constructive organizational values climate predicts three types of OCBs: helping, taking charge, and creative behavior. Furthermore, drawing on regulatory focus theory and on the change-oriented and affiliative roots of OCBs, we offer two distinct mediators that shed light on the underlying processes. We test the proposed theory with data from 737 respondents residing in 166 work units in a wide variety of organizations.","['organizational climate', 'organizational citizenship behavior', 'commitment', 'empowerment', 'managing paradox', 'regulatory focus theory', 'competing values frameworkREGULATORY FOCUS', 'PSYCHOLOGICAL EMPOWERMENT', 'INTERRATER RELIABILITY', 'NORMATIVE COMMITMENT', 'PARADOX', 'MODEL', 'ANTECEDENTS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LEADERSHIP', 'CULTURE']","['organizational climate', 'organizational climate', 'organizational citizenship behavior', 'organizational citizenship behavior', 'organizational citizenship behavior', 'managing paradox', 'managing paradox', 'regulatory focus theory', 'regulatory focus theory', 'regulatory focus theory', 'paradox']",citizenship behaviors work environment focus
"Using archival data on a year of e-mail exchanges at a division of Enron (Study 1) and a field study of management professionals (Study 2), we explore how the relative hierarchical rank of a message sender and a message recipient affects expressions of verbal deference in organizational e-mail communication. Verbal deference refers to linguistic markers that convey a willingness to yield to another's preferences or opinions as a sign of respect or reverence. Although prior research has focused on upward deference in an organizational hierarchy, from lower-ranked senders to higher-ranked recipients, we predict and find that the greatest amount of deference is expressed laterally, between peers of equal or similar rank. Further, lateral deference is most frequently displayed by those individuals most concerned with preserving their status and rank, confirming that lateral deference may be used as a status-saving strategy designed to protect individuals from status loss associated with overstepping one's place.","['deference', 'status', 'hierarchy', 'communicationSOCIAL-STATUS', 'SPEECH STYLE', 'REQUEST STRATEGIES', 'NONVERBAL BEHAVIOR', 'POWER', 'PERCEPTIONS', 'EXPRESSIONS', 'PERSONALITY', 'MECHANISM', 'DOMINANCE']","['deference', 'status', 'hierarchy', 'expressions']",deference e mail
"Managing new product development (NPD) is, to a great extent, a process of separating the winners from the losers. At the project level, tough go/no-go decisions must be made throughout each development effort to ensure that resources are being allocated appropriately. At the company level, benchmarking is helpful for identifying the critical success factors that set the most successful firms apart from their competitors. This company- or macro-level analysis also has the potential for uncovering success factors that are not readily apparent through examination of specific projects. To improve our understanding of the company-level drivers of NPD success, Robert Cooper and Elko Kleinschmidt describe the results of a multi-firn benchmarking study. They propose that a compnny's overall new product performance depends on the following elements: the NPD process and the specific activities within this process; the organization of the NPD program; the firm's NPD strategy; the firm's culture and climate for innovation; and senior management commitment to NPD. Given the multidimensional nature of NPD performance, the study involves 10 performance measures of a company's new product program: success rate, percent of sales, profitability relative to spending, technical success rating, sales impact, profit impact, success in meeting sales objectives, success in meeting profit objectives, profitability relative to competitors, and overall success. The 10 performance metrics are reduced to two underlying dimensions: program profitability and program impact. These performance factors become the X- and Y-axes of a performance map, a visual summary of the relative performance of the 135 companies responding to the survey. The performance map further breaks down the respondents into four groups: solid performers, high-impact technical winners, low-impact performers, and dogs. Again, the objective of this analysis is to determine what separates the solid performers from the companies in the other groups. The analysis identifies nine constructs that drive performance. In rank order of their impact on performance, the main performance drivers that separate the solid performers from the dogs are: a high-quality new product process; a clear, well-communicated new product strategy for the company; adequate resources for new products; senior management commitment to new products; an entrepreneurial climate for product innovation; senior management accountability; strategic focus and synergy (i.e., new products close to the firm's existing markets and leveraging existing technologies); high-quality development teams; and cross-functional teams.","['nanINDUSTRIAL', 'PERSPECTIVE', 'MANAGEMENT', 'INNOVATION', 'FAILURE']","['management', 'innovation']",success climate innovation

"Corporate governance (CG) research has typically been studied from rather disparate disciplinary approaches, thereby offering myopic and often conflicting rationales. We develop an institutional configurational approach to integrate this siloed' field and explain CG patterns around the world. To do so, we draw on an inductive, theory-building methodology based on fuzzy-set logic to uncover the configurations across institutional actor-centred domains and their impact on CG patterns. Empirically, we explore the necessary and sufficient causal conditions leading to different features of codes of good governance across 32 OECD countries. We generate propositions linking configurational institutional domains to code features. Our results show that a single institutional domain by itself is not sufficient to explain CG outcomes, and that these domains need to be considered in conjunction, leading, in turn, to the identification of four distinct configurational governance prototypes. Our study offers a comprehensive account of drivers of cross-national differences in CG and yields useful insights for managing and regulating governance.","['codes', 'corporate governance', 'institutional configuration', 'qualitative comparative analysisCODES', 'LAW', 'OWNERSHIP', 'WORLDWIDE', 'FRENCH', 'MARKET', 'STATE']","['codes', 'corporate governance', 'corporate governance', 'institutional configuration', 'institutional configuration']",corporate governance configurational fuzzy set logic

"Enthusiastic customer endorsements can significantly influence buying decisions and drive sales. In service contexts, advocates are especially important because the specific and complex characteristics of services make personal recommendations very effective. Customer advocacy communications differ from other positive word of mouth (PWOM), though literature on advocacy is surprisingly sparse and inconsistent. Notably, advocacy is strong, passionate, explicit, and ongoing, with an explicit goal of positively influencing others' views. As its central theoretical contributions, this article defines advocacy; identifies advocacy as a distinctive form of PWOM; conceptualizes advocacy according to a hierarchy of behaviors, which increase in intensity and effort; and develops a robust, reliable advocacy scale. By investigating positive behavioral outcomes of different levels of advocacy, this study also reveals the importance of identifying strong advocates, rather than just those who give PWOM, as well as salient drivers of advocacy. Accordingly, this article establishes a platform for further investigations of the importance of advocates, as well as recommendations to help managers identify these potentially valuable advocates.","['advocacy', 'positive word of mouth', 'Rasch modeling', 'advocacy profileCONSUMER-BRAND IDENTIFICATION', 'SOCIAL-INFLUENCE', 'SERVICE QUALITY', 'MODEL', 'INTENTIONS', 'BEHAVIORS', 'DELIGHT', 'POWER', 'SELF', 'COMMUNICATION']","['advocacy', 'positive word of mouth', 'positive word of mouth', 'positive word of mouth', 'positive word of mouth', 'behaviors', 'communication']",word of mouth pwom behaviors scale outcomes
"Purpose - This paper aims to explore the effect of e-marketplace on the supply chain's performance under the markdown policy. Profit and risk analyses are both conducted and channel coordination issues are examined. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a markdown policy supply chain analytical model with e-marketplace and examines the optimal markdown policy. The mean-variance theory is employed to study both the risk and profit residing in the supply chain. Extensive numerical analysis is conducted. The paper investigates both the cases when e-marketplace selling price is exogenous and endogenous. Findings - The markdown policy can coordinate the supply chain as long as the parameters satisfy certain analytical conditions. The expected profit and risk in the supply chain are both increased when e-marketplace is introduced. The retailer shares a larger portion of the increased expected profit but at the same time bears a higher risk. Research limitations/implications - In this study, similar to the mainstream literature in the related area, the supply chain consists of one manufacturer and one retailer, and there is one single selling season with one product. Despite being able to generate interesting analytical results, this model fails to capture the more complicated real world practices. Practical implications - The existence of e-marketplace can be beneficial to the whole supply chain in terms of expected profit improvement. When the expected profit increase brought about by e-marketplace is large enough to compensate for both the operational cost of e-marketplace and the increase of the risk, the retailer could consider introducing e-marketplace to dispose of the excess inventory. Originality/value - This paper is an original work. It is based on the reviewed literature and the model with markdown policy is new. This could be a reference for further research into optimal performance in the supply chain with e-marketplace.","['Markdown policy', 'E-marketplace', 'Mean-variance theory', 'Numerical analysis', 'Supply change managementRETURNS POLICY', 'CHANNEL', 'COORDINATION']","['markdown policy', 'markdown policy', 'e marketplace', 'e marketplace', 'mean variance theory', 'mean variance theory', 'mean variance theory', 'numerical analysis', 'numerical analysis', 'channel', 'coordination']",marketplace analytical model
"How do we, as management researchers, develop novel theoretical contributions and, thereby, potentially break new ground in management studies? To address this question, we review previous methodological work on theorizing and advance a typology of the reasoning processes that underlie theoretical contributions and significant advances in management studies. This typology consists of various types of analogical and counterfactual reasoning, ranging from focused thought experiments aimed at prodding existing theory in the direction of alternative assumptions, constructs, and hypotheses to more expansive efforts for inducing new theoretical models and alternative explanations. Applying this typology, we detail the mechanisms behind the formation of novel theoretical contributions and illustrate the currency of our typology through a review of 24 major theoretical breakthroughs in management studies. We conclude the paper by discussing the implications of this typology for our collective efforts in building, elaborating, and expanding theory in management studies.","['analogy', 'counterfactuals', 'management research', 'theoretical contribution', 'theoryCOUNTERFACTUAL THINKING', 'BUILDING THEORY', 'OPPORTUNITIES', 'CONSTITUTES', 'RETHINKING', 'METAPHOR', 'FUTURE', 'ISSUES']","['management research', 'management research', 'theoretical contribution', 'theoretical contribution']",models studies
"Previous research has identified customer satisfaction and customer-company identification as two of the most important concepts in relationship marketing. Yet despite their proclaimed importance, research on their long-term effectiveness is surprisingly scarce. Furthermore, comparative research acknowledging the concepts' different theoretical roots and illuminating the differences in their long-term effectiveness is lacking. In addition, little is known about how competitive actions affect the long-term effectiveness of both concepts. This study makes a first attempt to address these research gaps and offers a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of customer satisfaction and customer-company identification in driving important customer outcomes over time. Latent growth analyses of rich longitudinal data from customers over nine measurement points spanning 43 weeks (n = 6,930) show that customer satisfaction and customer-company identification have positive initial effects on customers' loyalty and willingness to pay but differ in their ability to maintain these positive effects over time. Whereas the positive effects of customer satisfaction decrease more rapidly, the effects of customer-company identification are significantly more persistent. Analysis of the moderating effects of relative competitive advertising suggests that customer-company identification is more effective at immunizing customers against competitive actions.","['customer satisfaction', 'customer-company identification', 'customer loyalty', 'customer willingness to pay', 'latent growth modelingCORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS', 'WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY', 'ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTIFICATION', 'CONSUMER SATISFACTION', 'SATISFIED CUSTOMERS', 'SELF-EXPRESSION', 'UNITED-STATES', 'MARKET SHARE', 'GROWTH']","['customer satisfaction', 'customer satisfaction', 'customer company identification', 'customer company identification', 'customer company identification', 'willingness to pay', 'willingness to pay', 'willingness to pay', 'growth']",customer satisfaction customer company identification growth
"Using data from the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 companies for a 7-year period, the authors examine the role that institutional activism types and three salient board monitoring mechanisms CEO/board chair split, board composition, and compensation committee independence-play in influencing CEO contingent compensation in Canada. The authors find that the effect of institutional activism, especially proxy based, is stronger on contingent CEO compensation and that its effects span a longer time. As opposed to the interactions of cumulative proxy-based activism with any of the three monitoring mechanisms, the interactions of cumulative non-proxy-based activism with both CEO/board chair split and compensation committee independence appear to influence CEO contingent compensation. The study's implications are given.","['institutional activism', 'CEO compensation', 'board characteristics', 'corporate governanceRESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT', 'AGENCY THEORY PERSPECTIVE', 'EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION', 'OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE', 'FIRM PERFORMANCE', 'SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM', 'SOCIAL PERFORMANCE', 'INVESTORS', 'GOVERNANCE', 'BOARD']","['institutional activism', 'institutional activism', 'ceo compensation', 'ceo compensation', 'board']",institutional activism board monitoring
"Research Summary: This article brings together the competitive dynamics and strategy-as-practice literatures to investigate relational competition. Drawing on a global ethnography of the reinsurance market, we develop the concept of micro-competitions, which are the focus of competitors' everyday competitive practices. We find variation in relational or rivalrous competition by individual competitors across the phases of a micro-competition, between competitors within a micro-competition, and across multiple micro-competitions. These variations arise from the interplay between the unfolding competitive arena and the implementation of each firm's strategic portfolio. We develop a conceptual framework that makes four contributions to: relational competition; reconceptualizing action and response; elaborating on the awareness-motivation-capability framework within competitive dynamics; and the recursive dynamic by which implementing strategy inside firms shapes, and is shaped by, the competitive arena. Managerial Summary: Competition is often seen as war: attack, retaliation, and dethronement. Yet competition can also be relational, incorporating collaboration and reciprocity. We show these dynamics in a syndicated financial market, reinsurance, where multiple competitors get the same price for a share of the same deal. Our competitors have rivalrous motivations to win business and relational motivations to ensure buoyant pricing, maintain market health, and enable long-standing client relationships to persist. These motivations are grounded in the strategizing practices with which firms implement their strategic portfolios and compete on deals. Competitors' rivalrous or relational motivations are highly dynamic, shifting throughout the competition on any deal and across the multiple deals on which they compete. Cumulatively these practices shape the entire market for these volatile, uncertain financial products.","['practice theory', 'relational competition', 'reinsurance', 'strategizing', 'strategy-as-practice', 'syndicated marketSTRATEGY-AS-PRACTICE', 'UNITED-STATES', 'PERFORMANCE', 'DYNAMICS', 'RIVALRY', 'CHALLENGES', 'MANAGEMENT', 'FIRMS', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'SENSEMAKING']","['relational competition', 'relational competition', 'reinsurance', 'strategizing', 'strategy as practice', 'strategy as practice', 'strategy as practice', 'dynamics', 'firms']",dynamics strategy relational competition firm
"This study examines the relationships among environmental orientation, environmental strategy, firm performance, and regulatory stakeholder influence. Survey data collected from foreign invested enterprises (FIEs) in China show that while internal environmental orientation positively influences environmental corporate (but not marketing) strategies, external environmental orientation positively influences both. These two types of environmental strategy are, in turn, found to positively affect firm performance. Regulatory stakeholder influence is found to exert a direct effect on external environmental orientation. Moreover, it is found to positively moderate the relationship between environmental orientation and environmental strategy. These findings provide FIE executives with useful insights into enhancing firm performance through the pursuit of corporate environmentalism. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
